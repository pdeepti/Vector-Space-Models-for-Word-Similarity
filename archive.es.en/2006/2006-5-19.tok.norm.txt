dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .
-lrb- may 17 , 2006 -rrb- us reluctant to approve eu guarantee of iranian security as european countries consider offering iran security packages as incentives to freeze its nuclear program , iranian president ahmadinejad mocked nations angry with the islamic republic as suffering " mental problems .

the main subject at the " sport rules the world " conference was security at global sporting events . about a year ago , germany ’ s friedrich ebert foundation launched an initiative to encourage soccer fans from around the globe to inspire the upcoming world cup with their own ideas and suggestions .
it made a detailed analysis of what fans from the participating nations are expecting from germany as a host . fans were able voice their standpoints in regional hearings , debate discrepancies and coordinate their activities so as to ensure already in the run-up to the world cup that everything will hopefully proceed without any major security glitches . at the " sport rules the world " conference in berlin , parliamentarians from 15 countries exchanged experiences about sports .
the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .
unfortunately , it 's become so .
sport is supposed to be entertainment , something that brings people together , a unifying force . " world cup 2006 informative , but different for ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african continent will have time to make friends in ghana in 2008 for ghana , the german experience with the world cup will be of particular importance , as it is scheduled to host the cup of african nations in 2008 .
officials from the west african country are certain that a lot can be learned by studying german fan management schemes . but they are also aware that there are fundamental differences in the organizational structures . " there are points of divergence in africa .
a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .
interest in soccer has grown and it looks like it 's better understood than politics , " was his assessment . hardy graupner -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .

it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .
and bmw is erecting bmw world in munich , a shrine to its own image that is expected to cost 100 million euros .
the space will allow visitors to “ see , feel , hear smell , taste bmw , ” according to a brochure . meanwhile , vw set the standard for car-culture-combination marketing by building the theme-park-like autosatdt -lrb- car city -rrb- in wolfsburg in 2002 .
the autostadt has a “ museum of automobility , ” hands-on learning labs , and a children ’ s activity center , and hosts contemporary art exhibits and avant-garde theatrical performancees . then there 's the “ glass factory ” vw opened in dresden in 2001 .
it , too , treads a thin line between industry and culture , offering hands on , interactive exhibits for adults and children who come to marvel at the building 's architecture and observe the assembly of phaeton luxury cars .
the facility is also used after hours for theater performances . all about image but why do german car companies seem determined to drop big sums into high-priced show properties , even amid layoffs , cutbacks , and falling sales figures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exterior view of vw 's " glass factory " in dresden “ that ’ s easy , ” said markus betz , the museum designer who created the exhibition space for the mercedes benz museum and is currently at work on the porsche museum as well .
“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .
there is no phase in the history of the automobile that mercedes didn ’ t influence or write . ” writing automotive history perched right on the edge of a busy highway in stuttgart , the museum was computer-designed in concrete-chic by cutting-edge dutch architect ben van berkel .
a visit starts at the top of the eight-story museum , with an exhibit on the invention of the gas-powered automobile by gottlieb daimler and karl benz , in 1886 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes helped write automobile history a visitor can then continue though 120 years of automobile history by following the trail of the chronologically organized “ legend ” rooms -lrb- room 1:1886 to 1900 , the birth of the automobile ; room 4:1945-1960 , postwar miracle , etc . -rrb-
at the same time , he or she can check out a series of thematically organized " collection " rooms -lrb- gallery of the carriers , showing commercial transport vehicles throughout the ages ; gallery of celebrities , featuring cars that once belonged to the likes of princess diana , ringo starr , and japan ’ s emperor hirohito . -rrb- while the mercedes exhibit was an exercise in showing the interplay between a car and an entire culture , betz said the porsche museum poses another challenge .
" its more about just showing this sports car , and finding a way to make that interesting " not just for the husband , but for the wife and kids who might have been forced to come along . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go way back : merkel and mercedes in 2003 it is hard to know whether the image boost from such extravagant marketing campaigns will actually pay off .
but one thing is certain : german car museums are immensely popular .
the old mercedes museum in stuttgart had about 450,000 visitors a year , more than any other museum in the city .
the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .
we need to show what we can do . ’ ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investing in the future face of automobiles although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2006 vat increase puts germany closer to eu average großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government may be taking a bit more starting in january the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it . merkel 's government stuck to its plan to increase the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent starting in january 2007 and received parliament 's approval on friday , despite numerous warnings and criticism from economists and politicians that the hike could damage the recovering economy . german economists have repeatedly warned that the increase could put a damper on consumer spending , which has just started to pick up , is likely to push more workers to the employment black market and keep the government from finding long-term solutions to its overspending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping for 20 billion euros more in tax income " the value-added tax increase is being used almost only to fill holes in public spending , " professor michael hüther of the cologne institute for business research told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" that 's taking away the pressure to examine state spending and save more . " every year , germany spends about 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- more than it earns in taxes .
the government hopes the higher value-added tax will deliver an extra 20 billion euros into the tax coffers . one time merkel designee for finance minister paul kirchhof also told the newspaper he opposed " any policy that would increase taxes . " opposition in and outside of coalition ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said germany does n't need higher taxes guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's biggest opposition party , the free-market liberal free democrats , also blasted the plan for germany 's largest vat tax increase , arguing it is unnecessary and harmful . members of the ruling grand coalition , including social democrat niels annen , said they wanted to see how the tax would be implemented . annen told the public broadcaster ard raising taxes on low-income workers " would be socially unfair as well as economically wrong . " before friday 's 396 to 146 vote , he added that he would vote in favor of the increase but would be against any further tax hikes . " after this value-added tax increase there can not be any additional massive burdens for normal people , " he said .
the country 's last vat increase came in eight years ago when the tax went from 15 percent to 16 percent . unpopular with consumers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans said they 'd be saving less after the tax increase the tax increase leaves germany just below the eu 's average standard vat rate of 19.34 percent , about halfway between cyprus and luxembourg 's 15 percent and denmark and sweden 's 25 percent . according to a poll conducted zdf , another german public broadcaster , 78 percent of people are against the tax increase .
resignation , however , appears to be setting in as another study showed a majority of germans expect the government will come up with even more tax hikes over the next three years . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany should capitalize on current optimism germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes .
-lrb- may 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany raises tax revenue forecasts the german government on thursday revised upwards its forecast for tax revenues this year and in the coming years and vowed that it would be able to bring its deficit back within the eu 's budget limits from 2007 .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting . " atticus capital holds stakes of roughly 6 percent in each of deutsche börse , euronext and the nyse . " we have told him -lsb- nyse head john thain -rsb- that we intend to vote on the floor in favor of deutsche börse 's deal in the absence of any other mutually agreed proposal , " slager added . directors of both the nyse and deutsche börse have met with french finance minister thierry breton regarding their respective talks with euronext , the finance ministry said friday .
it was the first time that the nyse was clearly identified as a potential euronext partner . deutsche börse and euronext have failed to agree on key issues such as the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group . german exchange company making concessions among the biggest concessions made to euronext on friday , deutsche börse suggested that a holding company be set up for the new merged company which would be " domiciled " in amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's base would be the euronext exchange in amsterdam furthermore , the german company said it was " prepared to contribute its cash equity clearing to ... an independent , privately-run service provider " . while deutsche börse has so far refused to abandon its integrated structure , euronext has repeatedly argued for the clearing activities to be excluded from any merger . the german company also said the tie-up should be a " merger of partners " rather than a takeover of euronext by the bigger deutsche börse . " a new parent company , domiciled in the netherlands , should act as a holding company for both groups .
neither euronext nor deutsche börse shall be the absorbing entity to combine the two groups , " the company proposed . all börse and euronext businesses to be consolidated all of deutsche börse and euronext businesses would be included in the new group , " including deutsche börse 's post trading activities , " the german company said . " but we are prepared to contribute our cash equity clearing to a truly european cash equity clearing organization operated as an independent , privately-run service provider , " it said . it suggested that cash equity trading and listings activities would be operated out of paris , while derivatives trading would be operated and located in frankfurt and in london via euronext 's derivatives unit , liffe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be a major european force the combined entity would also have a two-tier board structure , with both companies represented equally on the executive board .
" initially , the management board of the combined group shall be led by euronext chief jean-francois theodore and deutsche börse head reto francioni becoming co-ceos , " deutsche börse said . euronext sources unenthusiastic about proposal in paris however , euronext spokeswoman antoinette darpy told afp : " there is absolutely nothing new in these proposals . " deutsche börse stressed that a merger would represent a " significant step forward in the integration of european financial markets .
it would form the logical partner for other european exchanges and would have the ability to compete on a global scale . " in milan , the president of the italian stock market angelo tantazzi said friday that euronext was the borsa italiana 's " first choice " for a potential tie-up . his comments were warmly greeted in paris , with the euronext spokeswoman telling afp : " we are very pleased with the position expressed by angelo tantazzi , which reinforces the idea that euronext 's open , federal model allows it to integrate , with full respect for specificities , other european markets . " investors , meanwhile , appeared to like deutsche börse 's proposals .
in frankfurt , deutsche börse shares closed with a gain of 3.01 percent at 111.10 euros .
euronext shares soared 5.97 percent to 74.60 euros in paris . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports frankfurt in deutsche börse-euronext merger the german government is adamant that frankfurt should play a " decisive " role in any tie-up between the stock market operators , rejecting attempts by france to move the merged company 's headquarters to paris .

the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .

" " those who get upset at the happiness and progress of others are suffering from a mental problem and therefore should find a way to cure themselves , " the defiantly hard-line president told a rally , according to the isna student news agency . " we have repeatedly said that we do not have any conflict with others , but will do our best to get our rights , " he said in a speech in the central town of zarandieh . ahmadinejad has been using increasingly flowery language in the showdown with the west over iran 's atomic ambitions , insisting wednesday that he would not accept " candy for gold " in reference to an eu offer to resolve the crisis . willing to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan however , he said thursday that tehran was ready to negotiate on its nuclear program with all nations , except its arch-foe israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the region . " the iranian nation has repeatedly said it is seeking its right in nuclear technology , and has maintained that it is ready to negotiate with all legitimate nations , " he said . on wednesday , however , ahmadinejad ridiculed a european union plan to offer trade and technology incentives in exchange for his country agreeing to halt sensitive nuclear work . security guarantees chief of the international atomic energy agency mohamed elbaradei called on the eu and us to bear in mind iran 's position in the middle east and to include a security component in the plan . " iran is surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons , " he said .
" the only solution is a package that should include security issues . " european powers including britain , france and germany are drawing up a package in the hope of coaxing iran into voluntarily curbing its atomic ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana has said the offer contains " issues relating to nuclear , economic matters , and maybe , if necessary , security matters . " diplomats said that under the draft deal , russia would enrich uranium on iran 's behalf and could also help tehran acquire a light-water nuclear reactor . military action the offer was to have been reviewed friday in london by the five permanent un security council members plus germany , but us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the world powers would now meet tuesday to work out a common approach . washington has been calling for a security council resolution that would invoke chapter seven of the un charter that could authorize sanctions or even military action as a last resort . but fellow veto-wielding security council members russia and china , which have close trade ties with tehran , have so far opposed coercive measures to rein in iran 's nuclear activities . us opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wo n't guarantee iran 's security asked about the eu proposal , mccormack said the united states would not give iran security guarantees in exchange for forfeiting its nuclear program .
" that 's not something from the united states that 's on the table , " he said . according to reuters , one eu diplomat said the us has told israel it would never give iran a security guarantee unless it recognizes the state 's right to exist . but the eu insists that only the us can guarantee iran 's security and is holding out hopes that washington might yet consider an indirect security guarantee by at least blessing the eu plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .

" " those who get upset at the happiness and progress of others are suffering from a mental problem and therefore should find a way to cure themselves , " the defiantly hard-line president told a rally , according to the isna student news agency . " we have repeatedly said that we do not have any conflict with others , but will do our best to get our rights , " he said in a speech in the central town of zarandieh . ahmadinejad has been using increasingly flowery language in the showdown with the west over iran 's atomic ambitions , insisting wednesday that he would not accept " candy for gold " in reference to an eu offer to resolve the crisis . willing to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan however , he said thursday that tehran was ready to negotiate on its nuclear program with all nations , except its arch-foe israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the region . " the iranian nation has repeatedly said it is seeking its right in nuclear technology , and has maintained that it is ready to negotiate with all legitimate nations , " he said . on wednesday , however , ahmadinejad ridiculed a european union plan to offer trade and technology incentives in exchange for his country agreeing to halt sensitive nuclear work . security guarantees chief of the international atomic energy agency mohamed elbaradei called on the eu and us to bear in mind iran 's position in the middle east and to include a security component in the plan . " iran is surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons , " he said .
" the only solution is a package that should include security issues . " european powers including britain , france and germany are drawing up a package in the hope of coaxing iran into voluntarily curbing its atomic ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana has said the offer contains " issues relating to nuclear , economic matters , and maybe , if necessary , security matters . " diplomats said that under the draft deal , russia would enrich uranium on iran 's behalf and could also help tehran acquire a light-water nuclear reactor . military action the offer was to have been reviewed friday in london by the five permanent un security council members plus germany , but us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the world powers would now meet tuesday to work out a common approach . washington has been calling for a security council resolution that would invoke chapter seven of the un charter that could authorize sanctions or even military action as a last resort . but fellow veto-wielding security council members russia and china , which have close trade ties with tehran , have so far opposed coercive measures to rein in iran 's nuclear activities . us opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wo n't guarantee iran 's security asked about the eu proposal , mccormack said the united states would not give iran security guarantees in exchange for forfeiting its nuclear program .
" that 's not something from the united states that 's on the table , " he said . according to reuters , one eu diplomat said the us has told israel it would never give iran a security guarantee unless it recognizes the state 's right to exist . but the eu insists that only the us can guarantee iran 's security and is holding out hopes that washington might yet consider an indirect security guarantee by at least blessing the eu plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting . " atticus capital holds stakes of roughly 6 percent in each of deutsche börse , euronext and the nyse . " we have told him -lsb- nyse head john thain -rsb- that we intend to vote on the floor in favor of deutsche börse 's deal in the absence of any other mutually agreed proposal , " slager added . directors of both the nyse and deutsche börse have met with french finance minister thierry breton regarding their respective talks with euronext , the finance ministry said friday .
it was the first time that the nyse was clearly identified as a potential euronext partner . deutsche börse and euronext have failed to agree on key issues such as the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group . german exchange company making concessions among the biggest concessions made to euronext on friday , deutsche börse suggested that a holding company be set up for the new merged company which would be " domiciled " in amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's base would be the euronext exchange in amsterdam furthermore , the german company said it was " prepared to contribute its cash equity clearing to ... an independent , privately-run service provider " . while deutsche börse has so far refused to abandon its integrated structure , euronext has repeatedly argued for the clearing activities to be excluded from any merger . the german company also said the tie-up should be a " merger of partners " rather than a takeover of euronext by the bigger deutsche börse . " a new parent company , domiciled in the netherlands , should act as a holding company for both groups .
neither euronext nor deutsche börse shall be the absorbing entity to combine the two groups , " the company proposed . all börse and euronext businesses to be consolidated all of deutsche börse and euronext businesses would be included in the new group , " including deutsche börse 's post trading activities , " the german company said . " but we are prepared to contribute our cash equity clearing to a truly european cash equity clearing organization operated as an independent , privately-run service provider , " it said . it suggested that cash equity trading and listings activities would be operated out of paris , while derivatives trading would be operated and located in frankfurt and in london via euronext 's derivatives unit , liffe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be a major european force the combined entity would also have a two-tier board structure , with both companies represented equally on the executive board .
" initially , the management board of the combined group shall be led by euronext chief jean-francois theodore and deutsche börse head reto francioni becoming co-ceos , " deutsche börse said . euronext sources unenthusiastic about proposal in paris however , euronext spokeswoman antoinette darpy told afp : " there is absolutely nothing new in these proposals . " deutsche börse stressed that a merger would represent a " significant step forward in the integration of european financial markets .
it would form the logical partner for other european exchanges and would have the ability to compete on a global scale . " in milan , the president of the italian stock market angelo tantazzi said friday that euronext was the borsa italiana 's " first choice " for a potential tie-up . his comments were warmly greeted in paris , with the euronext spokeswoman telling afp : " we are very pleased with the position expressed by angelo tantazzi , which reinforces the idea that euronext 's open , federal model allows it to integrate , with full respect for specificities , other european markets . " investors , meanwhile , appeared to like deutsche börse 's proposals .
in frankfurt , deutsche börse shares closed with a gain of 3.01 percent at 111.10 euros .
euronext shares soared 5.97 percent to 74.60 euros in paris . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports frankfurt in deutsche börse-euronext merger the german government is adamant that frankfurt should play a " decisive " role in any tie-up between the stock market operators , rejecting attempts by france to move the merged company 's headquarters to paris .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .
" with a democratically elected government the west will be able to support use with a good conscience .
that is the reason why it is so important that the elections are free and fair .

the main subject at the " sport rules the world " conference was security at global sporting events . about a year ago , germany ’ s friedrich ebert foundation launched an initiative to encourage soccer fans from around the globe to inspire the upcoming world cup with their own ideas and suggestions .
it made a detailed analysis of what fans from the participating nations are expecting from germany as a host . fans were able voice their standpoints in regional hearings , debate discrepancies and coordinate their activities so as to ensure already in the run-up to the world cup that everything will hopefully proceed without any major security glitches . at the " sport rules the world " conference in berlin , parliamentarians from 15 countries exchanged experiences about sports .
the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .
unfortunately , it 's become so .
sport is supposed to be entertainment , something that brings people together , a unifying force . " world cup 2006 informative , but different for ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african continent will have time to make friends in ghana in 2008 for ghana , the german experience with the world cup will be of particular importance , as it is scheduled to host the cup of african nations in 2008 .
officials from the west african country are certain that a lot can be learned by studying german fan management schemes . but they are also aware that there are fundamental differences in the organizational structures . " there are points of divergence in africa .
a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .
interest in soccer has grown and it looks like it 's better understood than politics , " was his assessment . hardy graupner -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .
what expectations do fans have for the world cup ?
what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ?
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- world cup security gives terror priority hooliganism has long been the bane of those organizing security for the 2006 world cup but germany 's police union chief has turned the attention to the terror threat on such an " attractive " target .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .
-lrb- may 17 , 2006 -rrb- us reluctant to approve eu guarantee of iranian security as european countries consider offering iran security packages as incentives to freeze its nuclear program , iranian president ahmadinejad mocked nations angry with the islamic republic as suffering " mental problems .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .

" that 's taking away the pressure to examine state spending and save more . " every year , germany spends about 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- more than it earns in taxes .
the government hopes the higher value-added tax will deliver an extra 20 billion euros into the tax coffers . one time merkel designee for finance minister paul kirchhof also told the newspaper he opposed " any policy that would increase taxes . " opposition in and outside of coalition ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said germany does n't need higher taxes guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's biggest opposition party , the free-market liberal free democrats , also blasted the plan for germany 's largest vat tax increase , arguing it is unnecessary and harmful . members of the ruling grand coalition , including social democrat niels annen , said they wanted to see how the tax would be implemented . annen told the public broadcaster ard raising taxes on low-income workers " would be socially unfair as well as economically wrong . " before friday 's 396 to 146 vote , he added that he would vote in favor of the increase but would be against any further tax hikes . " after this value-added tax increase there can not be any additional massive burdens for normal people , " he said .
the country 's last vat increase came in eight years ago when the tax went from 15 percent to 16 percent . unpopular with consumers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans said they 'd be saving less after the tax increase the tax increase leaves germany just below the eu 's average standard vat rate of 19.34 percent , about halfway between cyprus and luxembourg 's 15 percent and denmark and sweden 's 25 percent . according to a poll conducted zdf , another german public broadcaster , 78 percent of people are against the tax increase .
resignation , however , appears to be setting in as another study showed a majority of germans expect the government will come up with even more tax hikes over the next three years . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany should capitalize on current optimism germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .

the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .
and bmw is erecting bmw world in munich , a shrine to its own image that is expected to cost 100 million euros .
the space will allow visitors to “ see , feel , hear smell , taste bmw , ” according to a brochure . meanwhile , vw set the standard for car-culture-combination marketing by building the theme-park-like autosatdt -lrb- car city -rrb- in wolfsburg in 2002 .
the autostadt has a “ museum of automobility , ” hands-on learning labs , and a children ’ s activity center , and hosts contemporary art exhibits and avant-garde theatrical performancees . then there 's the “ glass factory ” vw opened in dresden in 2001 .
it , too , treads a thin line between industry and culture , offering hands on , interactive exhibits for adults and children who come to marvel at the building 's architecture and observe the assembly of phaeton luxury cars .
the facility is also used after hours for theater performances . all about image but why do german car companies seem determined to drop big sums into high-priced show properties , even amid layoffs , cutbacks , and falling sales figures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exterior view of vw 's " glass factory " in dresden “ that ’ s easy , ” said markus betz , the museum designer who created the exhibition space for the mercedes benz museum and is currently at work on the porsche museum as well .
“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .
there is no phase in the history of the automobile that mercedes didn ’ t influence or write . ” writing automotive history perched right on the edge of a busy highway in stuttgart , the museum was computer-designed in concrete-chic by cutting-edge dutch architect ben van berkel .
a visit starts at the top of the eight-story museum , with an exhibit on the invention of the gas-powered automobile by gottlieb daimler and karl benz , in 1886 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes helped write automobile history a visitor can then continue though 120 years of automobile history by following the trail of the chronologically organized “ legend ” rooms -lrb- room 1:1886 to 1900 , the birth of the automobile ; room 4:1945-1960 , postwar miracle , etc . -rrb-
at the same time , he or she can check out a series of thematically organized " collection " rooms -lrb- gallery of the carriers , showing commercial transport vehicles throughout the ages ; gallery of celebrities , featuring cars that once belonged to the likes of princess diana , ringo starr , and japan ’ s emperor hirohito . -rrb- while the mercedes exhibit was an exercise in showing the interplay between a car and an entire culture , betz said the porsche museum poses another challenge .
" its more about just showing this sports car , and finding a way to make that interesting " not just for the husband , but for the wife and kids who might have been forced to come along . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go way back : merkel and mercedes in 2003 it is hard to know whether the image boost from such extravagant marketing campaigns will actually pay off .
but one thing is certain : german car museums are immensely popular .
the old mercedes museum in stuttgart had about 450,000 visitors a year , more than any other museum in the city .
the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .
we need to show what we can do . ’ ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investing in the future face of automobiles although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position .

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .
and bmw is erecting bmw world in munich , a shrine to its own image that is expected to cost 100 million euros .
the space will allow visitors to “ see , feel , hear smell , taste bmw , ” according to a brochure . meanwhile , vw set the standard for car-culture-combination marketing by building the theme-park-like autosatdt -lrb- car city -rrb- in wolfsburg in 2002 .
the autostadt has a “ museum of automobility , ” hands-on learning labs , and a children ’ s activity center , and hosts contemporary art exhibits and avant-garde theatrical performancees . then there 's the “ glass factory ” vw opened in dresden in 2001 .
it , too , treads a thin line between industry and culture , offering hands on , interactive exhibits for adults and children who come to marvel at the building 's architecture and observe the assembly of phaeton luxury cars .
the facility is also used after hours for theater performances . all about image but why do german car companies seem determined to drop big sums into high-priced show properties , even amid layoffs , cutbacks , and falling sales figures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exterior view of vw 's " glass factory " in dresden “ that ’ s easy , ” said markus betz , the museum designer who created the exhibition space for the mercedes benz museum and is currently at work on the porsche museum as well .
“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .
there is no phase in the history of the automobile that mercedes didn ’ t influence or write . ” writing automotive history perched right on the edge of a busy highway in stuttgart , the museum was computer-designed in concrete-chic by cutting-edge dutch architect ben van berkel .
a visit starts at the top of the eight-story museum , with an exhibit on the invention of the gas-powered automobile by gottlieb daimler and karl benz , in 1886 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes helped write automobile history a visitor can then continue though 120 years of automobile history by following the trail of the chronologically organized “ legend ” rooms -lrb- room 1:1886 to 1900 , the birth of the automobile ; room 4:1945-1960 , postwar miracle , etc . -rrb-
at the same time , he or she can check out a series of thematically organized " collection " rooms -lrb- gallery of the carriers , showing commercial transport vehicles throughout the ages ; gallery of celebrities , featuring cars that once belonged to the likes of princess diana , ringo starr , and japan ’ s emperor hirohito . -rrb- while the mercedes exhibit was an exercise in showing the interplay between a car and an entire culture , betz said the porsche museum poses another challenge .
" its more about just showing this sports car , and finding a way to make that interesting " not just for the husband , but for the wife and kids who might have been forced to come along . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go way back : merkel and mercedes in 2003 it is hard to know whether the image boost from such extravagant marketing campaigns will actually pay off .
but one thing is certain : german car museums are immensely popular .
the old mercedes museum in stuttgart had about 450,000 visitors a year , more than any other museum in the city .
the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .
we need to show what we can do . ’ ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investing in the future face of automobiles although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .

the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .

of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .

it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .
and bmw is erecting bmw world in munich , a shrine to its own image that is expected to cost 100 million euros .
the space will allow visitors to “ see , feel , hear smell , taste bmw , ” according to a brochure . meanwhile , vw set the standard for car-culture-combination marketing by building the theme-park-like autosatdt -lrb- car city -rrb- in wolfsburg in 2002 .
the autostadt has a “ museum of automobility , ” hands-on learning labs , and a children ’ s activity center , and hosts contemporary art exhibits and avant-garde theatrical performancees . then there 's the “ glass factory ” vw opened in dresden in 2001 .
it , too , treads a thin line between industry and culture , offering hands on , interactive exhibits for adults and children who come to marvel at the building 's architecture and observe the assembly of phaeton luxury cars .
the facility is also used after hours for theater performances . all about image but why do german car companies seem determined to drop big sums into high-priced show properties , even amid layoffs , cutbacks , and falling sales figures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exterior view of vw 's " glass factory " in dresden “ that ’ s easy , ” said markus betz , the museum designer who created the exhibition space for the mercedes benz museum and is currently at work on the porsche museum as well .
“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .
there is no phase in the history of the automobile that mercedes didn ’ t influence or write . ” writing automotive history perched right on the edge of a busy highway in stuttgart , the museum was computer-designed in concrete-chic by cutting-edge dutch architect ben van berkel .
a visit starts at the top of the eight-story museum , with an exhibit on the invention of the gas-powered automobile by gottlieb daimler and karl benz , in 1886 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes helped write automobile history a visitor can then continue though 120 years of automobile history by following the trail of the chronologically organized “ legend ” rooms -lrb- room 1:1886 to 1900 , the birth of the automobile ; room 4:1945-1960 , postwar miracle , etc . -rrb-
at the same time , he or she can check out a series of thematically organized " collection " rooms -lrb- gallery of the carriers , showing commercial transport vehicles throughout the ages ; gallery of celebrities , featuring cars that once belonged to the likes of princess diana , ringo starr , and japan ’ s emperor hirohito . -rrb- while the mercedes exhibit was an exercise in showing the interplay between a car and an entire culture , betz said the porsche museum poses another challenge .
" its more about just showing this sports car , and finding a way to make that interesting " not just for the husband , but for the wife and kids who might have been forced to come along . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go way back : merkel and mercedes in 2003 it is hard to know whether the image boost from such extravagant marketing campaigns will actually pay off .
but one thing is certain : german car museums are immensely popular .
the old mercedes museum in stuttgart had about 450,000 visitors a year , more than any other museum in the city .
the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .
we need to show what we can do . ’ ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investing in the future face of automobiles although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position .

the main subject at the " sport rules the world " conference was security at global sporting events . about a year ago , germany ’ s friedrich ebert foundation launched an initiative to encourage soccer fans from around the globe to inspire the upcoming world cup with their own ideas and suggestions .
it made a detailed analysis of what fans from the participating nations are expecting from germany as a host . fans were able voice their standpoints in regional hearings , debate discrepancies and coordinate their activities so as to ensure already in the run-up to the world cup that everything will hopefully proceed without any major security glitches . at the " sport rules the world " conference in berlin , parliamentarians from 15 countries exchanged experiences about sports .
the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .
unfortunately , it 's become so .
sport is supposed to be entertainment , something that brings people together , a unifying force . " world cup 2006 informative , but different for ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african continent will have time to make friends in ghana in 2008 for ghana , the german experience with the world cup will be of particular importance , as it is scheduled to host the cup of african nations in 2008 .
officials from the west african country are certain that a lot can be learned by studying german fan management schemes . but they are also aware that there are fundamental differences in the organizational structures . " there are points of divergence in africa .
a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .
interest in soccer has grown and it looks like it 's better understood than politics , " was his assessment . hardy graupner -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .

“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .

" " those who get upset at the happiness and progress of others are suffering from a mental problem and therefore should find a way to cure themselves , " the defiantly hard-line president told a rally , according to the isna student news agency . " we have repeatedly said that we do not have any conflict with others , but will do our best to get our rights , " he said in a speech in the central town of zarandieh . ahmadinejad has been using increasingly flowery language in the showdown with the west over iran 's atomic ambitions , insisting wednesday that he would not accept " candy for gold " in reference to an eu offer to resolve the crisis . willing to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan however , he said thursday that tehran was ready to negotiate on its nuclear program with all nations , except its arch-foe israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the region . " the iranian nation has repeatedly said it is seeking its right in nuclear technology , and has maintained that it is ready to negotiate with all legitimate nations , " he said . on wednesday , however , ahmadinejad ridiculed a european union plan to offer trade and technology incentives in exchange for his country agreeing to halt sensitive nuclear work . security guarantees chief of the international atomic energy agency mohamed elbaradei called on the eu and us to bear in mind iran 's position in the middle east and to include a security component in the plan . " iran is surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons , " he said .
" the only solution is a package that should include security issues . " european powers including britain , france and germany are drawing up a package in the hope of coaxing iran into voluntarily curbing its atomic ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana has said the offer contains " issues relating to nuclear , economic matters , and maybe , if necessary , security matters . " diplomats said that under the draft deal , russia would enrich uranium on iran 's behalf and could also help tehran acquire a light-water nuclear reactor . military action the offer was to have been reviewed friday in london by the five permanent un security council members plus germany , but us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the world powers would now meet tuesday to work out a common approach . washington has been calling for a security council resolution that would invoke chapter seven of the un charter that could authorize sanctions or even military action as a last resort . but fellow veto-wielding security council members russia and china , which have close trade ties with tehran , have so far opposed coercive measures to rein in iran 's nuclear activities . us opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wo n't guarantee iran 's security asked about the eu proposal , mccormack said the united states would not give iran security guarantees in exchange for forfeiting its nuclear program .
" that 's not something from the united states that 's on the table , " he said . according to reuters , one eu diplomat said the us has told israel it would never give iran a security guarantee unless it recognizes the state 's right to exist . but the eu insists that only the us can guarantee iran 's security and is holding out hopes that washington might yet consider an indirect security guarantee by at least blessing the eu plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

yet it is no secret that german carmakers are facing difficult times , losing market share to cheaper asian and us models . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum 's architecture combines a sense of stasis and motion the new , 150 million euro -lrb- $ 191 million -rrb- mercedes benz museum is the latest example of the industry ’ s recent push to honor its history - and some would say shore up its image - by investing in a showpiece property . but merceds benz is by no means alone . porsche will open a flashy new museum in stuttgart next year , quadrupling its current exhibition space .
and bmw is erecting bmw world in munich , a shrine to its own image that is expected to cost 100 million euros .
the space will allow visitors to “ see , feel , hear smell , taste bmw , ” according to a brochure . meanwhile , vw set the standard for car-culture-combination marketing by building the theme-park-like autosatdt -lrb- car city -rrb- in wolfsburg in 2002 .
the autostadt has a “ museum of automobility , ” hands-on learning labs , and a children ’ s activity center , and hosts contemporary art exhibits and avant-garde theatrical performancees . then there 's the “ glass factory ” vw opened in dresden in 2001 .
it , too , treads a thin line between industry and culture , offering hands on , interactive exhibits for adults and children who come to marvel at the building 's architecture and observe the assembly of phaeton luxury cars .
the facility is also used after hours for theater performances . all about image but why do german car companies seem determined to drop big sums into high-priced show properties , even amid layoffs , cutbacks , and falling sales figures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exterior view of vw 's " glass factory " in dresden “ that ’ s easy , ” said markus betz , the museum designer who created the exhibition space for the mercedes benz museum and is currently at work on the porsche museum as well .
“ there is less and less difference between the premium automobile brands in terms of quality and technology , so they have to differentiate themselves that much more in terms of image . " “ european carmakers have a longer history than those in the american or asian market .
a favorite saying is , " there 's no future without ancestry ’ , ” betz said .
“ mercedes is special because daimler benz was there from the beginning of the history of cars .
there is no phase in the history of the automobile that mercedes didn ’ t influence or write . ” writing automotive history perched right on the edge of a busy highway in stuttgart , the museum was computer-designed in concrete-chic by cutting-edge dutch architect ben van berkel .
a visit starts at the top of the eight-story museum , with an exhibit on the invention of the gas-powered automobile by gottlieb daimler and karl benz , in 1886 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes helped write automobile history a visitor can then continue though 120 years of automobile history by following the trail of the chronologically organized “ legend ” rooms -lrb- room 1:1886 to 1900 , the birth of the automobile ; room 4:1945-1960 , postwar miracle , etc . -rrb-
at the same time , he or she can check out a series of thematically organized " collection " rooms -lrb- gallery of the carriers , showing commercial transport vehicles throughout the ages ; gallery of celebrities , featuring cars that once belonged to the likes of princess diana , ringo starr , and japan ’ s emperor hirohito . -rrb- while the mercedes exhibit was an exercise in showing the interplay between a car and an entire culture , betz said the porsche museum poses another challenge .
" its more about just showing this sports car , and finding a way to make that interesting " not just for the husband , but for the wife and kids who might have been forced to come along . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go way back : merkel and mercedes in 2003 it is hard to know whether the image boost from such extravagant marketing campaigns will actually pay off .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .

" that 's taking away the pressure to examine state spending and save more . " every year , germany spends about 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- more than it earns in taxes .
the government hopes the higher value-added tax will deliver an extra 20 billion euros into the tax coffers . one time merkel designee for finance minister paul kirchhof also told the newspaper he opposed " any policy that would increase taxes . " opposition in and outside of coalition ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said germany does n't need higher taxes guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's biggest opposition party , the free-market liberal free democrats , also blasted the plan for germany 's largest vat tax increase , arguing it is unnecessary and harmful . members of the ruling grand coalition , including social democrat niels annen , said they wanted to see how the tax would be implemented . annen told the public broadcaster ard raising taxes on low-income workers " would be socially unfair as well as economically wrong . " before friday 's 396 to 146 vote , he added that he would vote in favor of the increase but would be against any further tax hikes . " after this value-added tax increase there can not be any additional massive burdens for normal people , " he said .
the country 's last vat increase came in eight years ago when the tax went from 15 percent to 16 percent . unpopular with consumers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans said they 'd be saving less after the tax increase the tax increase leaves germany just below the eu 's average standard vat rate of 19.34 percent , about halfway between cyprus and luxembourg 's 15 percent and denmark and sweden 's 25 percent . according to a poll conducted zdf , another german public broadcaster , 78 percent of people are against the tax increase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting . " atticus capital holds stakes of roughly 6 percent in each of deutsche börse , euronext and the nyse . " we have told him -lsb- nyse head john thain -rsb- that we intend to vote on the floor in favor of deutsche börse 's deal in the absence of any other mutually agreed proposal , " slager added . directors of both the nyse and deutsche börse have met with french finance minister thierry breton regarding their respective talks with euronext , the finance ministry said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

31 , 2003 . mistaken identity claim after being held for several weeks in an unknown location , where he was beaten and sodomized with a foreign object , he alleged , he was drugged and sent to the cia-run afghan prison called the " salt pit " where he was tortured and interrogated as a suspected terrorist with links to the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . after four months - on may 28 , 2004 - lebanon-born el-masri claims , he was flown blindfolded in a private jet from kabul to albania , where he was left on the side of an abandoned road to make his own way home . the 42 year old el-masri believes that he was mistaken for another person sought by the united states in its war on terror and that he was nevertheless held for weeks after tenet , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and other top us officials knew of the error . asserting state-secret privilege the judge did , however , stress that his rejection of the lawsuit made no judgement on the merit of el-masri ’ s claims .
but in the end the court ruled in favor of government arguments that because the case involves clandestine activities it should not be allowed to proceed because it would cause damage to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this airplane was mentioned in a report by police investigating the cia rendition program " there is no doubt that the state secrets privilege is validly asserted here , " the ruling said . " while dismissal of the complaint deprives el-masri of an american judicial forum for vindicating his claims ...
el-masri 's private interests must give way to the national interest in preserving state secrets . " the el-masri case was the first legal challenge in the united states confronting the controversial clandestine cia " extraordinary renditions " program , which involves seizing terrorist suspects and transferring them to secret prisons for interrogation . his claims led european leaders to order investigations into the us rendition policy .
us and foreign human rights groups have said the program involves severe torture and denial of basic rights . court requests ' remedy ' the alexandria court showed some sympathy to el-masri , who was not present for the hearing , when it concluded in its ruling that , if there is any truth to his story , the us government should offer a " remedy . " " if el-masri 's allegations are true or essentially true , then all fair-minded people , including those who believe that state secrets must be protected -lrb- and -rrb- that renditions are a necessary step to take in this war , must also agree that el-masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country 's mistake and deserves a remedy , " the judgement said . the judge said that remedy should come from the us government 's executive or legislative branch , and not the courts . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

31 , 2003 . mistaken identity claim after being held for several weeks in an unknown location , where he was beaten and sodomized with a foreign object , he alleged , he was drugged and sent to the cia-run afghan prison called the " salt pit " where he was tortured and interrogated as a suspected terrorist with links to the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . after four months - on may 28 , 2004 - lebanon-born el-masri claims , he was flown blindfolded in a private jet from kabul to albania , where he was left on the side of an abandoned road to make his own way home . the 42 year old el-masri believes that he was mistaken for another person sought by the united states in its war on terror and that he was nevertheless held for weeks after tenet , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and other top us officials knew of the error . asserting state-secret privilege the judge did , however , stress that his rejection of the lawsuit made no judgement on the merit of el-masri ’ s claims .
but in the end the court ruled in favor of government arguments that because the case involves clandestine activities it should not be allowed to proceed because it would cause damage to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this airplane was mentioned in a report by police investigating the cia rendition program " there is no doubt that the state secrets privilege is validly asserted here , " the ruling said . " while dismissal of the complaint deprives el-masri of an american judicial forum for vindicating his claims ...
el-masri 's private interests must give way to the national interest in preserving state secrets . " the el-masri case was the first legal challenge in the united states confronting the controversial clandestine cia " extraordinary renditions " program , which involves seizing terrorist suspects and transferring them to secret prisons for interrogation . his claims led european leaders to order investigations into the us rendition policy .
us and foreign human rights groups have said the program involves severe torture and denial of basic rights . court requests ' remedy ' the alexandria court showed some sympathy to el-masri , who was not present for the hearing , when it concluded in its ruling that , if there is any truth to his story , the us government should offer a " remedy . " " if el-masri 's allegations are true or essentially true , then all fair-minded people , including those who believe that state secrets must be protected -lrb- and -rrb- that renditions are a necessary step to take in this war , must also agree that el-masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country 's mistake and deserves a remedy , " the judgement said . the judge said that remedy should come from the us government 's executive or legislative branch , and not the courts . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the fight against racism in soccer anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism fifa boss accused of u-turn on world cup racism measures rights groups warn about racism at world cup ; hotline set up fifa toughens racism regulations current affairs -pipe- 19.05.2006 opinion : fighting racism needs action , not words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public declarations help , but they do n't suffice : action is needed to combat racism .
when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .

at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the fight against racism in soccer anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism fifa boss accused of u-turn on world cup racism measures rights groups warn about racism at world cup ; hotline set up fifa toughens racism regulations current affairs -pipe- 19.05.2006 opinion : fighting racism needs action , not words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public declarations help , but they do n't suffice : action is needed to combat racism .
when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .

31 , 2003 . mistaken identity claim after being held for several weeks in an unknown location , where he was beaten and sodomized with a foreign object , he alleged , he was drugged and sent to the cia-run afghan prison called the " salt pit " where he was tortured and interrogated as a suspected terrorist with links to the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . after four months - on may 28 , 2004 - lebanon-born el-masri claims , he was flown blindfolded in a private jet from kabul to albania , where he was left on the side of an abandoned road to make his own way home . the 42 year old el-masri believes that he was mistaken for another person sought by the united states in its war on terror and that he was nevertheless held for weeks after tenet , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and other top us officials knew of the error . asserting state-secret privilege the judge did , however , stress that his rejection of the lawsuit made no judgement on the merit of el-masri ’ s claims .
but in the end the court ruled in favor of government arguments that because the case involves clandestine activities it should not be allowed to proceed because it would cause damage to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this airplane was mentioned in a report by police investigating the cia rendition program " there is no doubt that the state secrets privilege is validly asserted here , " the ruling said . " while dismissal of the complaint deprives el-masri of an american judicial forum for vindicating his claims ...
el-masri 's private interests must give way to the national interest in preserving state secrets . " the el-masri case was the first legal challenge in the united states confronting the controversial clandestine cia " extraordinary renditions " program , which involves seizing terrorist suspects and transferring them to secret prisons for interrogation . his claims led european leaders to order investigations into the us rendition policy .
us and foreign human rights groups have said the program involves severe torture and denial of basic rights . court requests ' remedy ' the alexandria court showed some sympathy to el-masri , who was not present for the hearing , when it concluded in its ruling that , if there is any truth to his story , the us government should offer a " remedy . " " if el-masri 's allegations are true or essentially true , then all fair-minded people , including those who believe that state secrets must be protected -lrb- and -rrb- that renditions are a necessary step to take in this war , must also agree that el-masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country 's mistake and deserves a remedy , " the judgement said . the judge said that remedy should come from the us government 's executive or legislative branch , and not the courts . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting . " atticus capital holds stakes of roughly 6 percent in each of deutsche börse , euronext and the nyse . " we have told him -lsb- nyse head john thain -rsb- that we intend to vote on the floor in favor of deutsche börse 's deal in the absence of any other mutually agreed proposal , " slager added . directors of both the nyse and deutsche börse have met with french finance minister thierry breton regarding their respective talks with euronext , the finance ministry said friday .
it was the first time that the nyse was clearly identified as a potential euronext partner . deutsche börse and euronext have failed to agree on key issues such as the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group . german exchange company making concessions among the biggest concessions made to euronext on friday , deutsche börse suggested that a holding company be set up for the new merged company which would be " domiciled " in amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's base would be the euronext exchange in amsterdam furthermore , the german company said it was " prepared to contribute its cash equity clearing to ... an independent , privately-run service provider " . while deutsche börse has so far refused to abandon its integrated structure , euronext has repeatedly argued for the clearing activities to be excluded from any merger . the german company also said the tie-up should be a " merger of partners " rather than a takeover of euronext by the bigger deutsche börse . " a new parent company , domiciled in the netherlands , should act as a holding company for both groups .
neither euronext nor deutsche börse shall be the absorbing entity to combine the two groups , " the company proposed . all börse and euronext businesses to be consolidated all of deutsche börse and euronext businesses would be included in the new group , " including deutsche börse 's post trading activities , " the german company said . " but we are prepared to contribute our cash equity clearing to a truly european cash equity clearing organization operated as an independent , privately-run service provider , " it said . it suggested that cash equity trading and listings activities would be operated out of paris , while derivatives trading would be operated and located in frankfurt and in london via euronext 's derivatives unit , liffe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be a major european force the combined entity would also have a two-tier board structure , with both companies represented equally on the executive board .
" initially , the management board of the combined group shall be led by euronext chief jean-francois theodore and deutsche börse head reto francioni becoming co-ceos , " deutsche börse said . euronext sources unenthusiastic about proposal in paris however , euronext spokeswoman antoinette darpy told afp : " there is absolutely nothing new in these proposals . " deutsche börse stressed that a merger would represent a " significant step forward in the integration of european financial markets .
it would form the logical partner for other european exchanges and would have the ability to compete on a global scale . " in milan , the president of the italian stock market angelo tantazzi said friday that euronext was the borsa italiana 's " first choice " for a potential tie-up . his comments were warmly greeted in paris , with the euronext spokeswoman telling afp : " we are very pleased with the position expressed by angelo tantazzi , which reinforces the idea that euronext 's open , federal model allows it to integrate , with full respect for specificities , other european markets . " investors , meanwhile , appeared to like deutsche börse 's proposals .
in frankfurt , deutsche börse shares closed with a gain of 3.01 percent at 111.10 euros .
euronext shares soared 5.97 percent to 74.60 euros in paris . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports frankfurt in deutsche börse-euronext merger the german government is adamant that frankfurt should play a " decisive " role in any tie-up between the stock market operators , rejecting attempts by france to move the merged company 's headquarters to paris .

to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .

" the el-masri case was the first legal challenge in the united states confronting the controversial clandestine cia " extraordinary renditions " program , which involves seizing terrorist suspects and transferring them to secret prisons for interrogation . his claims led european leaders to order investigations into the us rendition policy .
us and foreign human rights groups have said the program involves severe torture and denial of basic rights . court requests ' remedy ' the alexandria court showed some sympathy to el-masri , who was not present for the hearing , when it concluded in its ruling that , if there is any truth to his story , the us government should offer a " remedy .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .
" with a democratically elected government the west will be able to support use with a good conscience .
that is the reason why it is so important that the elections are free and fair .

" that 's taking away the pressure to examine state spending and save more . " every year , germany spends about 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- more than it earns in taxes .
the government hopes the higher value-added tax will deliver an extra 20 billion euros into the tax coffers . one time merkel designee for finance minister paul kirchhof also told the newspaper he opposed " any policy that would increase taxes .

the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .
unfortunately , it 's become so .
sport is supposed to be entertainment , something that brings people together , a unifying force . " world cup 2006 informative , but different for ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african continent will have time to make friends in ghana in 2008 for ghana , the german experience with the world cup will be of particular importance , as it is scheduled to host the cup of african nations in 2008 .
officials from the west african country are certain that a lot can be learned by studying german fan management schemes . but they are also aware that there are fundamental differences in the organizational structures . " there are points of divergence in africa .
a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .
interest in soccer has grown and it looks like it 's better understood than politics , " was his assessment . hardy graupner -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .

" " those who get upset at the happiness and progress of others are suffering from a mental problem and therefore should find a way to cure themselves , " the defiantly hard-line president told a rally , according to the isna student news agency . " we have repeatedly said that we do not have any conflict with others , but will do our best to get our rights , " he said in a speech in the central town of zarandieh . ahmadinejad has been using increasingly flowery language in the showdown with the west over iran 's atomic ambitions , insisting wednesday that he would not accept " candy for gold " in reference to an eu offer to resolve the crisis . willing to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan however , he said thursday that tehran was ready to negotiate on its nuclear program with all nations , except its arch-foe israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the region . " the iranian nation has repeatedly said it is seeking its right in nuclear technology , and has maintained that it is ready to negotiate with all legitimate nations , " he said . on wednesday , however , ahmadinejad ridiculed a european union plan to offer trade and technology incentives in exchange for his country agreeing to halt sensitive nuclear work . security guarantees chief of the international atomic energy agency mohamed elbaradei called on the eu and us to bear in mind iran 's position in the middle east and to include a security component in the plan . " iran is surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons , " he said .
" the only solution is a package that should include security issues . " european powers including britain , france and germany are drawing up a package in the hope of coaxing iran into voluntarily curbing its atomic ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana has said the offer contains " issues relating to nuclear , economic matters , and maybe , if necessary , security matters . " diplomats said that under the draft deal , russia would enrich uranium on iran 's behalf and could also help tehran acquire a light-water nuclear reactor . military action the offer was to have been reviewed friday in london by the five permanent un security council members plus germany , but us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the world powers would now meet tuesday to work out a common approach . washington has been calling for a security council resolution that would invoke chapter seven of the un charter that could authorize sanctions or even military action as a last resort . but fellow veto-wielding security council members russia and china , which have close trade ties with tehran , have so far opposed coercive measures to rein in iran 's nuclear activities . us opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wo n't guarantee iran 's security asked about the eu proposal , mccormack said the united states would not give iran security guarantees in exchange for forfeiting its nuclear program .
" that 's not something from the united states that 's on the table , " he said . according to reuters , one eu diplomat said the us has told israel it would never give iran a security guarantee unless it recognizes the state 's right to exist . but the eu insists that only the us can guarantee iran 's security and is holding out hopes that washington might yet consider an indirect security guarantee by at least blessing the eu plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

31 , 2003 . mistaken identity claim after being held for several weeks in an unknown location , where he was beaten and sodomized with a foreign object , he alleged , he was drugged and sent to the cia-run afghan prison called the " salt pit " where he was tortured and interrogated as a suspected terrorist with links to the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . after four months - on may 28 , 2004 - lebanon-born el-masri claims , he was flown blindfolded in a private jet from kabul to albania , where he was left on the side of an abandoned road to make his own way home . the 42 year old el-masri believes that he was mistaken for another person sought by the united states in its war on terror and that he was nevertheless held for weeks after tenet , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and other top us officials knew of the error . asserting state-secret privilege the judge did , however , stress that his rejection of the lawsuit made no judgement on the merit of el-masri ’ s claims .
but in the end the court ruled in favor of government arguments that because the case involves clandestine activities it should not be allowed to proceed because it would cause damage to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this airplane was mentioned in a report by police investigating the cia rendition program " there is no doubt that the state secrets privilege is validly asserted here , " the ruling said . " while dismissal of the complaint deprives el-masri of an american judicial forum for vindicating his claims ...
el-masri 's private interests must give way to the national interest in preserving state secrets . " the el-masri case was the first legal challenge in the united states confronting the controversial clandestine cia " extraordinary renditions " program , which involves seizing terrorist suspects and transferring them to secret prisons for interrogation . his claims led european leaders to order investigations into the us rendition policy .
us and foreign human rights groups have said the program involves severe torture and denial of basic rights . court requests ' remedy ' the alexandria court showed some sympathy to el-masri , who was not present for the hearing , when it concluded in its ruling that , if there is any truth to his story , the us government should offer a " remedy . " " if el-masri 's allegations are true or essentially true , then all fair-minded people , including those who believe that state secrets must be protected -lrb- and -rrb- that renditions are a necessary step to take in this war , must also agree that el-masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country 's mistake and deserves a remedy , " the judgement said . the judge said that remedy should come from the us government 's executive or legislative branch , and not the courts . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave !

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .

the main subject at the " sport rules the world " conference was security at global sporting events . about a year ago , germany ’ s friedrich ebert foundation launched an initiative to encourage soccer fans from around the globe to inspire the upcoming world cup with their own ideas and suggestions .
it made a detailed analysis of what fans from the participating nations are expecting from germany as a host . fans were able voice their standpoints in regional hearings , debate discrepancies and coordinate their activities so as to ensure already in the run-up to the world cup that everything will hopefully proceed without any major security glitches . at the " sport rules the world " conference in berlin , parliamentarians from 15 countries exchanged experiences about sports .
the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .
unfortunately , it 's become so .
sport is supposed to be entertainment , something that brings people together , a unifying force . " world cup 2006 informative , but different for ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african continent will have time to make friends in ghana in 2008 for ghana , the german experience with the world cup will be of particular importance , as it is scheduled to host the cup of african nations in 2008 .
officials from the west african country are certain that a lot can be learned by studying german fan management schemes . but they are also aware that there are fundamental differences in the organizational structures . " there are points of divergence in africa .
a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .
interest in soccer has grown and it looks like it 's better understood than politics , " was his assessment . hardy graupner -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .

but the latter has so far reacted rather coolly to frankfurt 's overtures , and said friday there was " nothing new " in the latest german proposals . meanwhile , euronext has embarked on talks with other suitors . top among them are the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , the world 's biggest equity market , which is looking hard for a european partner after its rival us market , the tech-oriented nasdaq , acquired a 25.1 percent stake in the london stock exchange . börse waits on assembly decision on takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal will be discussed behind closed doors a group of influential euronext shareholders gave interested parties until a general assembly on tuesday to make a clear offer for the european operator , failing which they would vote for a merger with deutsche börse , the financial times reported friday . it quoted david slager , a partner in the hedge fund atticus capital as saying : " we have given the nyse or any other exchange a deadline of the annual meeting .

" we have told him -lsb- nyse head john thain -rsb- that we intend to vote on the floor in favor of deutsche börse 's deal in the absence of any other mutually agreed proposal , " slager added . directors of both the nyse and deutsche börse have met with french finance minister thierry breton regarding their respective talks with euronext , the finance ministry said friday .
it was the first time that the nyse was clearly identified as a potential euronext partner . deutsche börse and euronext have failed to agree on key issues such as the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group . german exchange company making concessions among the biggest concessions made to euronext on friday , deutsche börse suggested that a holding company be set up for the new merged company which would be " domiciled " in amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's base would be the euronext exchange in amsterdam furthermore , the german company said it was " prepared to contribute its cash equity clearing to ... an independent , privately-run service provider " . while deutsche börse has so far refused to abandon its integrated structure , euronext has repeatedly argued for the clearing activities to be excluded from any merger . the german company also said the tie-up should be a " merger of partners " rather than a takeover of euronext by the bigger deutsche börse . " a new parent company , domiciled in the netherlands , should act as a holding company for both groups .
neither euronext nor deutsche börse shall be the absorbing entity to combine the two groups , " the company proposed . all börse and euronext businesses to be consolidated all of deutsche börse and euronext businesses would be included in the new group , " including deutsche börse 's post trading activities , " the german company said . " but we are prepared to contribute our cash equity clearing to a truly european cash equity clearing organization operated as an independent , privately-run service provider , " it said . it suggested that cash equity trading and listings activities would be operated out of paris , while derivatives trading would be operated and located in frankfurt and in london via euronext 's derivatives unit , liffe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be a major european force the combined entity would also have a two-tier board structure , with both companies represented equally on the executive board .
" initially , the management board of the combined group shall be led by euronext chief jean-francois theodore and deutsche börse head reto francioni becoming co-ceos , " deutsche börse said . euronext sources unenthusiastic about proposal in paris however , euronext spokeswoman antoinette darpy told afp : " there is absolutely nothing new in these proposals . " deutsche börse stressed that a merger would represent a " significant step forward in the integration of european financial markets .
it would form the logical partner for other european exchanges and would have the ability to compete on a global scale . " in milan , the president of the italian stock market angelo tantazzi said friday that euronext was the borsa italiana 's " first choice " for a potential tie-up . his comments were warmly greeted in paris , with the euronext spokeswoman telling afp : " we are very pleased with the position expressed by angelo tantazzi , which reinforces the idea that euronext 's open , federal model allows it to integrate , with full respect for specificities , other european markets . " investors , meanwhile , appeared to like deutsche börse 's proposals .

world cup organizers , meanwhile , made available another 42,000 tickets for the month-long finals . if your attempts to buy world cup tickets via the official method , e.g. through fifa or a national soccer association , have failed so far , the temptation to purchase tickets on the black market or over the internet is great .
to prevent a world cup ticket bazaar from flourishing , however , german organizers have personalized tickets . this has not hindered owners of the cherished goods from hawking their wares on ebay .
on the online auction house 's german site , prices for matches such as brazil vs. australia or host germany against poland are fetching far over 400 euros , several times the official price . german soccer association chief theo zwanziger warned that the purchasers are " running a risk .
-lrb- they 're -rrb- going to the stadium under a false name … and runs the risk of being turned away . " when confronted with a reporter 's suggestion that stadium officials will only be able to perform random identity checks at the venues , zwangiger pointed out that if the security situation is deemed critical , and the word is out that fans are going to the stadiums without officially issued tickets , checks will be intensified . " and then those who do n't have -lrb- official tickets -rrb- will be spotted , and then they 'll have paid a lot of money and they 'll be sent home .
so i 'd advise them to spare themselves the frustration , " he added . the world soccer governing body fifa has criticized the german organizers for ticket sale process .
president sepp blatter has said he feared people would be standing in lines outside the stadiums while the first goal has already been scored inside . needless to say , the organizers of the world cup have released 42,495 tickets that had been returned to fifa .
the tickets can be purchased online at the tournament 's official web site . dw-world.de ticket scams on the increase as world cup draws near with just six and a half weeks until the world cup kicks-off , host nation germany is still struggling to combat ticketing scams from cunning fraudsters looking to exploit desperate soccer fans .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- probe into world cup ticket gifts for politicians causes stir with just over one month to go before the world cup kicks off in germany , the inquiry into sponsors passing on free tickets to public officials has sparked a heated debate .
-lrb- may 9 , 2006 -rrb- england soccer fans get world cup warning do n't mention the war .
in fact , do n't imitate or make insulting reference to the war either , a german police official has warned english fans planning to attend the soccer world cup in this summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .

in münster , an errant plane part made short work of a fast food joint , in an accident involving vintage aircraft , a tennis court , and a very big piece of glass . the saga began when a british pilot was flying his world war ii u.s. fighter p51 mustang to be exhibited at the international air show -lrb- ila -rrb- in berlin .
as he passed over the german city of münster , the 1.9 meter -lrb- 6 foot -rrb- plexiglass-and-steel cockpit cover broke away from the plane and plummeted to earth , striking the roof of a house and demolishing a takeaway stand . the runaway dome also narrowly missed a woman on a tennis court , who was there to pick up her daughter from a lesson . the pilot , robert w. davies , apparently did not follow normal procedure and send out an emergency call on the internationally-available sos radio channel .
instead he completed his flight in a topless plane . it was n't clear if he tried to signal the accident over a different radio channel .
flying without a cockpit dome is possible and legal , air safety authorities said . some 400 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- later , davies , who owns a number of vintage aircraft , landed as scheduled in berlin 's schönefeld airport .
he parked the single-engine bomber where it belonged for the show before it was seized by investigators . it was not immediately obvious why davies and his co-pilot did n't land at one of the local airports in the area around münster . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de say cheese -lrb- and fasten your seatbelt -rrb- a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

the main subject at the " sport rules the world " conference was security at global sporting events . about a year ago , germany ’ s friedrich ebert foundation launched an initiative to encourage soccer fans from around the globe to inspire the upcoming world cup with their own ideas and suggestions .
it made a detailed analysis of what fans from the participating nations are expecting from germany as a host . fans were able voice their standpoints in regional hearings , debate discrepancies and coordinate their activities so as to ensure already in the run-up to the world cup that everything will hopefully proceed without any major security glitches . at the " sport rules the world " conference in berlin , parliamentarians from 15 countries exchanged experiences about sports .
the common opinion was that soccer is first and foremost a source of inspiration and joy for millions of people around the world .
yet , modern events must also be concerned about security when millions are attending . " i think in the world now , security is very important when it comes to hosting people from different parts of the world , " commented joe baidoe-ansah , a lawmaker from the west african country ghana .
" and i think the emphasis is right that we look at it -lrb- security -rrb- .

a great deal of organization has to do with governments .
it 's not necessarily limited to -lrb- soccer -rrb- associations and private enterprises .
the point of divergence is the role governments play , both at the national and club level , " said ghanaian parliamentarian abuga pele . " if soccer ruled the world addressing the gathering , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that in a sense he ’ d be in favor of football ruling the world , as the title of the current conference suggested .
he had spoken with sepp blatter , head of the world soccer governing fifa , and the two found common ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer sometimes brings people together better than politics the world would be a better place if the social and integrative virtues of football would make inroads into politics and societies to a larger extent , he said . " it ’ s the team sport which is so valuable because it ’ s based on rules that every player has to observe .
everyone is aware of the necessities of these rules , because otherwise there could be no meaningful play .
and virtues such as team spirit , fairness and discipline are required for every society to function well , " schäuble told conference attendees . ghanaian lawmaker baidoe-ansah agreed .
he felt that the impact of football on society at large has gone up tremendously in recent decades : " it has been more unifying , playing a more unifying role .

in münster , an errant plane part made short work of a fast food joint , in an accident involving vintage aircraft , a tennis court , and a very big piece of glass . the saga began when a british pilot was flying his world war ii u.s. fighter p51 mustang to be exhibited at the international air show -lrb- ila -rrb- in berlin .
as he passed over the german city of münster , the 1.9 meter -lrb- 6 foot -rrb- plexiglass-and-steel cockpit cover broke away from the plane and plummeted to earth , striking the roof of a house and demolishing a takeaway stand . the runaway dome also narrowly missed a woman on a tennis court , who was there to pick up her daughter from a lesson . the pilot , robert w. davies , apparently did not follow normal procedure and send out an emergency call on the internationally-available sos radio channel .
instead he completed his flight in a topless plane . it was n't clear if he tried to signal the accident over a different radio channel .
flying without a cockpit dome is possible and legal , air safety authorities said . some 400 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- later , davies , who owns a number of vintage aircraft , landed as scheduled in berlin 's schönefeld airport .
he parked the single-engine bomber where it belonged for the show before it was seized by investigators . it was not immediately obvious why davies and his co-pilot did n't land at one of the local airports in the area around münster . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de say cheese -lrb- and fasten your seatbelt -rrb- a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .

the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .
" with a democratically elected government the west will be able to support use with a good conscience .
that is the reason why it is so important that the elections are free and fair .

some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .
" with a democratically elected government the west will be able to support use with a good conscience .
that is the reason why it is so important that the elections are free and fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2006 brzezinski : military option not a profitable course of action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political scientist zbigniew brzezinski believes the us should reconsider its mideast policies zbigniew brzezinski is one of the united states ' most recognized foreign policy analysts .
dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .

" " those who get upset at the happiness and progress of others are suffering from a mental problem and therefore should find a way to cure themselves , " the defiantly hard-line president told a rally , according to the isna student news agency . " we have repeatedly said that we do not have any conflict with others , but will do our best to get our rights , " he said in a speech in the central town of zarandieh . ahmadinejad has been using increasingly flowery language in the showdown with the west over iran 's atomic ambitions , insisting wednesday that he would not accept " candy for gold " in reference to an eu offer to resolve the crisis . willing to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan however , he said thursday that tehran was ready to negotiate on its nuclear program with all nations , except its arch-foe israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the region . " the iranian nation has repeatedly said it is seeking its right in nuclear technology , and has maintained that it is ready to negotiate with all legitimate nations , " he said . on wednesday , however , ahmadinejad ridiculed a european union plan to offer trade and technology incentives in exchange for his country agreeing to halt sensitive nuclear work . security guarantees chief of the international atomic energy agency mohamed elbaradei called on the eu and us to bear in mind iran 's position in the middle east and to include a security component in the plan . " iran is surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons , " he said .
" the only solution is a package that should include security issues . " european powers including britain , france and germany are drawing up a package in the hope of coaxing iran into voluntarily curbing its atomic ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana has said the offer contains " issues relating to nuclear , economic matters , and maybe , if necessary , security matters . " diplomats said that under the draft deal , russia would enrich uranium on iran 's behalf and could also help tehran acquire a light-water nuclear reactor . military action the offer was to have been reviewed friday in london by the five permanent un security council members plus germany , but us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the world powers would now meet tuesday to work out a common approach . washington has been calling for a security council resolution that would invoke chapter seven of the un charter that could authorize sanctions or even military action as a last resort . but fellow veto-wielding security council members russia and china , which have close trade ties with tehran , have so far opposed coercive measures to rein in iran 's nuclear activities . us opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wo n't guarantee iran 's security asked about the eu proposal , mccormack said the united states would not give iran security guarantees in exchange for forfeiting its nuclear program .
" that 's not something from the united states that 's on the table , " he said . according to reuters , one eu diplomat said the us has told israel it would never give iran a security guarantee unless it recognizes the state 's right to exist . but the eu insists that only the us can guarantee iran 's security and is holding out hopes that washington might yet consider an indirect security guarantee by at least blessing the eu plan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

the autodstadt in wolfsburg has had 12 million visitors since it opened , and bmw world is predicting 850,000 visitors a year . meanwhile , betz admitted that he was “ astonished ” when he heard chancellor merkel would attend the museum opening . now , however , he has come to see her visit as “ a sign of recognition for what mercedes did for the german public ” at its own costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image counts more heavily when models are technically similar “ its not a museum whose end goal is to have people just go sign a contract for a new mercedes ; it is an important addition to the technical museum landscape of the country , ” betz said . and more than that , he said , merkel is supporting mercedes ' vote of confidence for germany as a manufacturing country . “ even though asians are making luxury cars , german car makers are saying , ‘ hey folks , look at us .
we are looking toward the future . ’ , " betz said . " it is mercedes saying , ‘ don ’ t crawl back into your hole .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

in münster , an errant plane part made short work of a fast food joint , in an accident involving vintage aircraft , a tennis court , and a very big piece of glass . the saga began when a british pilot was flying his world war ii u.s. fighter p51 mustang to be exhibited at the international air show -lrb- ila -rrb- in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the fight against racism in soccer anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism fifa boss accused of u-turn on world cup racism measures rights groups warn about racism at world cup ; hotline set up fifa toughens racism regulations current affairs -pipe- 19.05.2006 opinion : fighting racism needs action , not words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public declarations help , but they do n't suffice : action is needed to combat racism .
when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .

that 's one reason why many people in congo are relieved to hear that germany has decided to send troops as part of the eu mission to ensure a peaceful election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu force will support un peacekeepers already in congo " the congolese people are especially happy that germans are taking on an important role , because germany has a good reputation in contrast with other european countries , " said saleh mwana milongo , a congolese journalist . people are more skeptical of the french troops , who will also make up a large portion of the eu troops , because they are seen as supporting particular candidates , one of the reason why some candidates called for limited french and belgian participation in the mission , milongo added . unease over troops ' neutrality france and belgium were once colonial powers in congo and both are still often blamed by congolese looking for an explanation of why the large country , rich in natural resources has hardly developed after 66 years of independence . a number of observers are especially concerned french troops , despite the protestations of neutrality , may lend their support to ruling president joseph kabila .
some congolese also doubt if european troops will actually be able to ensure safety during the elections , according to milongo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the european troops will be based in the congolese capital " the positioning of the soldiers alone - namely at the kinshasa airport - has people nervous , " he said .
" they say , ' maybe the europeans are afraid what could happen here and are planning for their own safety and how to get out the other white people who live here . " ' the relatively small number of troops in the area is another common concern .
about 1,500 soldiers will support the 18,000 soldiers in the united nations ' monuc peacekeeping mission with about two-thirds of the european contingent stationed in gabun .
congo 's foreign minister raymond ramazani baya , however , said he does not see the number of troops as a problem . congolese positive about elections " they are mostly in kinshasa and near the capital and will be able to keep an eye on only about half the country , and that will be enough , " he said .
" we also have the monuc troops and our own army .
the europeans are only coming to help us make sure chaos does not break out . " the government does not see a danger of violence engulfing the country , baya added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kinshasa hope for free and fair elections that end peacefully but many people on the street are afraid of exactly that and wondering what good troops at the airport will be as daily reports of militia attacks reach the capital from the country 's eastern reaches , according to milongo . still , most of the population is optimistic about the elections , he added . " a lot of people hope these elections will end the chaos and unrest in the country , " he said .
" with a democratically elected government the west will be able to support use with a good conscience .
that is the reason why it is so important that the elections are free and fair .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .
that the us has said it does not rule out military action could increase the european bargaining power it hasn ’ t said that directly .
it said all options are on the table .
but in fact that probably strengthens the hand of people like ahmadinejad because it makes it possible for them to appeal to iranian nationalism and to say that iran is not going to negotiate not under threats and duress .
last but not least , how truly credible is the threat of bombing iranian nuclear facilities ? that will then precipitate a major crisis in the persian gulf , probably a dramatic increase in the price of oil - maybe to double of what it is today - and hence , an international economic crisis , more instability in iran and afghanistan , where iran has a capacity to make serious trouble ; perhaps even in lebanon with the hezbollah .
perhaps strikes against israel ?
so what sort of a threat is it really ? so you think the bush administration is not really considering military action an option ? it may be considering it an option .
but if it has a moment of sanity and calculates the actions and counteractions which such an event would precipitate , i think the rational conclusion would be that this would not be a very profitable course of action while threats to undertake it have the opposite effect of fusing iranian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism and that certainly does not make the negotiating process any easier . if iran does indeed have plans to acquire nuclear weapons , under which circumstances could it be willing to abandon those plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brzezinksi does n't believe iran 's nuclear program is strictly meant for weapon production first of all , i don ’ t think it ’ s a foregone conclusion that they have plans to acquire nuclear weapons .
there are indications that they are seeking the capability to produce them .
but it is also quite possible that they may decide to have a posture like that of japan , which has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but is not actually producing them .
that is a further complication in one 's analysis of their intentions . but beyond that we just don ’ t know how far they are prepared to go because we have haven ’ t had serious negotiations regarding not only the nuclear problem but also related problems such as the american-iranian security relationship - or security fears on both sides .
there are the various contentious issues pertaining to financial settlements , problems of embargo as well as regional security involving iran , iraq , and afghanistan . these issues are part of the larger negotiating context .
but given the present procedure for negotiations , these issues are not addressed because in fact negotiations are being conducted between three european countries and iran , with china and russia on the sidelines - partially agreeing , partially disagreeing .
the united states negotiates with its european friends , who then negotiate with iran and negotiate with china and russia , but does not negotiate with iran . what would the world look like if iran became a nuclear power ? that depends on what kind of iran .
i do not happen to favor nuclear proliferation , and therefore , it is desirable to avoid it .
but what about pakistan ?
how stable is pakistan compared to iran ?
what are the prospects of pakistan becoming a democracy in the next ten years as compared to iran becoming more like turkey in the next ten years ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan president pervez musharraf -lrb- l . -rrb- also has nuclear weapons at his disposal so you believe that deterrence would work ? does it work in the case of pakistan ?
it depends on how stable the pakistani government is .
and we know it has been the object of assassination attempts .
i would say that iran is considerably more predictable and stable than pakistan . you said iran could use its influence in iraq to make the situation for us troops even more difficult .
what can the us do to improve the situation in iraq ? basically i advocate a four point program .
firstly , the us should consult with the iraqi government and set a time table for american departure , maybe within a year or so .
those iraqi leaders who would agree are probably the iraqi leaders who have the confidence that they could govern .
those who would say , " no , don ’ t leave ! " are the ones who would leave when we leave - so it tells you something about their capacity to govern . secondly , once we have reached an agreement with the iraqis regarding a possible date , let 's say a year from now , then we would jointly announce it as a joint decision . thirdly , upon our departure , the iraqi government would convene a conference of adjoining muslim states , who have an interest in stability in iraq to help the iraqi government - maybe even with peacekeeping forces - in consolidating stability .
although i do think that the shias and the kurds have the capacity to prevail upon the sunnis to accommodate . and then fourthly , upon american departure the us would convene a donors ' conference to help rehabilitate iraq ; a little bit like the bonn conference on afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us war against iraq has cost lives , money and credibility wouldn ’ t a withdrawal weaken the us for years if not decades ? why ?
i think the engagement in iraq is weakening us .
it is costly in blood , in money , in international antagonism , and it is an engagement that is not large enough to be militarily decisive but large enough to be militarily counterproductive in the sense that it keeps the violence going and mobilizes more hostility against us . a withdrawal could reduce the credibility of future threats against governments . do you think the present performance increases credibility ? dennis stute interviewed zbigniew brzezinski -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran rejects eu nuclear incentive iran 's president has snubbed a european union offer to help acquire a light-water nuclear reactor in exchange for the country agreeing to give up its uranium enrichment .

dw-world.de spoke with jimmy carter 's former security advisor about the ongoing tensions with iran and the situation in iraq . dw-world : the iranian president ahmadinejad has ridiculed the european offer to provide a light-water reactor as an incentive to freeze uranium enrichment .
has diplomacy failed ? zbigniew brzezinski : one has to recognize that when one says president ahmadinejad , one is using the title of president which means something entirely different in the west from what it means in the iranian system .
president ahmadinejad is not the president of iran in the sense that the president of the us is mr. bush , and the president of france is mr. chirac . the position of the president in iran is roughly a third-level position .
his executive powers are quite limited . what the west has done , and what the us in part has done , is to elevate him into an interlocutor , who then uses the debate with the west to enhance his domestic political power .
so i don ’ t consider his responses to be authoritative . but were n't the recent steps to begin enrichment supported by the iranian regime as a whole ? the desire to go forward with uranium enrichment is the iranian position .
but that is not necessarily the last word insofar as the negotiating process is concerned .
it depends a great deal on how that negotiating process is conducted , and it is my view that the united states itself has to join the negotiating process in order to make it truly serious . right now the us is not even involved in those negotiations .
i was pleased to see that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger now has joined me in advocating a more active and direct us role in the negotiations process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : direct talks between the us and iran would be more productive some may argue that the present division of labor makes sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.05.2006 hip hop is today 's punk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hip-hop duo aims to make " honest " music gerald mandl and florian zwietnig have made a name for themselves as mediengruppe telekommander .
dw-world.de spoke to them about their newly released second album , " näher am menschen , " and the changing music industry . dw.world.de : what 's the story behind your name ? gerald mandl : we got the name from italy .
telecommando means remote control , and we thought it would be great for an electronic project .
at some point , it occurred to us to expand the name to mediengruppe -lrb- media group -rrb- telekommander , since it 's not only the music that 's important to us , but also the graphic design , the web site , etc . the new album sounds a bit cleaner , better produced . mandl : this time we focussed quite heavily on the music production .
we worked with live drums , recorded the drums , cut them and interwove them with the electronic sounds and generally wanted to have more depth and dynamic in it .
the first album was totally loud and always on the edge .
the new one is much more dynamic . the first album sounds rawer and that was an identifying feature .
not that the protest element is n't in the new album , but it sounds more polished . florian zwietnig : yes , that 's how we wanted it .
we wanted to develop further musically and not stand still on that point .
we did n't want to make a second record that sounded exactly like the first , but instead to go a step further musically and textually .
it was a logical step in the development that we brought out more sound-wise . with you two , you ca n't tell where the critical attitude ends and the joke begins .
do you do that on purpose ? zwietnig : it 's very important to us not to become a classic punk band with our content .
the last thing we wanted was to shout whatever well-known slogans that are clearly directly against something .
that people say : we are here and over there is something we 're criticizing .
it has to always be done with a certain wink and a certain irony so that you see yourself as a part of the whole and do n't take yourself so seriously .
punk often takes itself too seriously . i have n't noticed a punk style of protest in your music , but rather a much more amusing way to criticize that 's more likely to come from hip hop . mandl : it 's today 's punk . zwietnig : we listen to a lot of hip hop , and then this special mixture emerged .
but in any case , we try not to take ourselves too seriously . is " underground " still a concept today ? zwietnig : to be honest , it 's ever more difficult to label it that way .
of course there are scenes that play out in a way that would now be called underground .
things that happen entirely off the beaten track .
bands that are never reviewed anywhere , but that everyone knows who belongs to that scene .
but that is an infinitesimally small portion . then is underground merely the preliminary phase before getting a record contract ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian singer and pop musician falco : innovative in the german-singing world mandl : no , there 's still something that goes on parallel to the commercial market .
there are lots of fanzines , fan magazines for the different musical areas , where records are also discussed .
to me it 's more of a co-existence . zwietnig : today " indie " is just a music style .
but you ca n't forget that this picture is heavily affected by america .
many of these so-called indie companies - which really were small companies for the americans - are bigger than many a media company in germany ever was .
and everything that we used to pick up on as underground and indie was already so commercial and big that it only seemed indie to us , because compared to tina turner , or mariah carey today , it was underground .
but in reality it was similarly commercial as everything else - otherwise we would n't even have picked up on it in germany . is n't it a sad paradox that today we can easily get music from throughout the world at the same time as the underground scene disappears ? zwietnig : i really do n't know why that 's happening .
it is a structural change and it will only be be apparent in a few years what will come of it .
the big record labels are not what they once were .
they are decaying too , having to let personnel go , are dwindling quite heavily .
and it 's still open what the structure will emerge next .
perhaps a new underground will come out of the internet , so that bands become famous through web sites like myspace , without ever having recorded anything . your breakthrough came in 2004 , when your first big hit was played on german music video channel viva , which no longer exists .
do you think that could happen today ? mandl : there 's no channel that would play our video anymore .
in austria , there are a few broadcasters that could still play our videos , but otherwise it would n't be possible anymore . zwietnig : it seems that the broadcasters work better with cell phone ring tones than just with music .
you probably ca n't yet say what effect that has on the music industry .
i do n't actively buy very much music these days , but when i look back i remember that i used to buy things after i became aware of them through mtv .
if you consider that the broadcast time that is purely for music videos , and especially german music videos , is only a tiny percentage - one band at the most is featured per month and that certainly wo n't be the mediengruppe . what do you think of german hip hop , which is visible everywhere these days ? mandl : we found the beginnings of german-language hip hop , above all that of it from hamburg , really witty and innovative , linguistically innovative .
the hip hop now going on , is musically ok , but the content - and the way it 's presented - is simply badly copied from american ghetto rap .
when people know think they have to act tough and that there are tough parts of town i do n't like it . zwietnig : there is no such thing as german hip hop , just german-language hip hop .
and there people try to come relatively close to the model from america in terms of technical production .
there is no creative impulse to make something of one 's own .
falco is a very good example for the first step in german hip hop and something absolutely innovative . one of your fans said you sound like berlin .
what does berlin sound like ? mandl : dirty . zwietnig : i think that what connects the rest of germany to the berlin music style is a sort of electronic music with people singing to it .
like peaches or chicks on speed .
and the bizarre thing about it is they do n't even come from berlin .
that 's the image that is projected , even if there are thousands of other bands in berlin . rodrigo abdelmalack interviewed mediengruppe telekommander -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour takes visitors through berlin 's rock history berlin 's special atmosphere has inspired scores of tortured rock legends from david bowie to nick cave .

when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .
dw 's peter phillipp says talk on the topic is good , but action would be better . was it a generic judgement , or a serious and substantiated warning ?
once again , it comes down to a battle of ideologies .
the same questions came up several weeks ago , after an ethiopian-born german was nearly beaten to death in the street in public .
the pundits asked : are east germans more xenophobic and racist than the rest of the country ?
and just how well does germany as a whole deal with people of color ?
it took a while for the debate to die down , but now , it has broken out again .
in force . it was an unusual comment for a former government spokesman to make .
in a radio interview , uwe-karsten heye warned people of color who were planning to attend the world cup in germany this summer to avoid certain areas of eastern germany .
otherwise , he said , they faced serious danger .
of course , heye was just repeating what statistics have long showed : certain regions in germany are more dangerous than others .
but it was certainly wrong to give the impression that racism prevails solely in the eastern states .
official statistics clearly refute this .
there are radical right-wingers in the west as well as the east , and the violent crimes they commit are rising in both regions . short-term memories this of course makes east germans no more racist than their western german counterparts .
but that is also not what heye meant to say , which is why he issued a correction to his statement .
he wanted to draw attention to a problem that authorities and public officials all too often turn a blind eye to : xenophobia and racist assaults tend to be seen as a " one-off " event , and then things go back to business as usual .
long forgotten are the roiling far-right scenes of the early 1990s in places like rostock and hoyerswerda in the east , and solingen in the west .
then , foreigners were openly hunted down and most average citizens looked on passively . in recent times , active racist violence may have calmed down in germany , but the core problem hasnt been eliminated .
it ca n't be , because there is no patent remedy for racism .
interviews with horrified citizens look good on television , but they do n't prevent racism , which has its roots in ultra-bourgeois homes , in joblessness and hopelessness , in failed schools and training programs , and - above all - a lack of will on behalf of the government to resolutely tackle the problem .
when right-wing radicals flood into saxony 's parliament , why should n't their followers feel compelled to go out on the street and set fire to a turkish kabob stand , or thrash an african ? call for energetic action of course it is wrong to designate whole parcels of land as radical-right danger zones , and declare them " no-go zones . "
to do so is to be unfair to the honorable and upright citizens in those regions .
we can not make this problem go away simply by talking .
we need to take action at last .
energetic action , if necessary , in terms of monitoring , prosecution and punishment , so that the violent far-right elements and their backers finally feel the pressure . this is not something we can accomplish overnight , and certainly not before the world cup .
but the sooner we start , the better . peter phillipp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .

the 61-year-old bromley and chislehurst mp served as a trade and education minister in the 1990s .
in opposition he served as shadow commons leader .
tory leader david cameron praised mr forth for his " incisive wit " and said he was a " master of detail " .
tony blair said he was the kind of colourful character who made the house of commons what it was .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said mr blair believed mr forth would be sorely missed - even by those who had disagreed with him .
' masterclass ' known for his trademark colourful ties and waistcoats , mr forth was famous for using intricate parliamentary procedures to thwart government plans .
he used filibusters to kill or delay legislation , especially when he thought it was being rushed through parliament - a tactic which made him one of the best known performers in the commons .
mr forth died in london 's charing cross hospital on wednesday night .
his illness became worse at the end of last week and he was admitted to hospital . "
he was a free spirit who infuriated and entertained in equal measure " bbc political editor nick robinson mr cameron said the death of mr forth , a big fan of elvis presley , had robbed the commons of one its stars and his constituency of a great champion .
" my first job as an opposition spokesman was serving under eric when he was shadow leader of the house , " he said .
" watching him speak in parliament as an mp and from the front bench was a masterclass in how you can use the house of commons to hold governments to account .

the 21 trainee chefs ranging in age from 16 to 24 all come from cornwall - an economically disadvantaged county with one of the highest unemployment rates .
on wednesday their culinary skills were put to the test -lrb- or should that be taste ? -rrb- at a charity lunch to mark the official opening of fifteen cornwall in watergate bay near newquay .
the restaurant is the third set up by jamie oliver to train and inspire young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to build a career in catering and develop a passion for good food . "
maybe nine or ten years down the road i 'll be opening my own place and that 's something a year ago i could n't even have dreamed of " kieran venner , trainee chef the long-term aim of television 's naked chef is to see some of his students open their own restaurants - a vision now shared by kieran venner from st austell .
before being selected for fifteen cornwall , the 20-year-old from st austell said his future prospects were non-existent .
kieran told bbc news that being accepted on the training course was a turning point in his life .
" when i was younger i got in trouble with the police and ended up getting sent to a young offenders ' institution at the age of 16 and that was a pretty low point in my life .
" but i got a job in the bistro cooking food for the staff and that was my first experience of work in a kitchen .
" i really do n't know what i would 've done if i had n't been accepted , but hopefully the heads of the foundation saw a little bit of potential in me .
" the training has been great so far .
we 've got such a great team and i give a lot of respect to all the staff at cornwall college because they made it a really good time for all of us .
" it 's fantastic that the restaurant 's in cornwall because we 've got some great produce here and it will be great for the cornish economy too . "
none of the trainees have had the best start in life ; none have any formal qualifications , some have had drug problems and some have learning difficulties .
tenacious employee andrew harris from st blazey has had a rather unusual personal battle to keep his place with the other student chefs .
the 19-year-old has overcome a seafood phobia and proudly demonstrated this achievement by eating some cockles .
" well , it 's a slightly different taste , but i 've done it now " , he said .
" it 's been an amazing day .
i 'm so tired because i was far too excited to sleep last night and i kept trying to imagine what it would be like today . "
none of the problems have stopped oliver , who is dyslexic himself , from putting his faith and trust in the ability of these cornish youngsters .
kieran venner is determined to do whatever it takes to justify the trust placed in him and build a secure future for his 16-month-old daughter aimee jade , who he describes as his motivation .
" two years from now i see myself with some money in the bank and hopefully a nice little two-bedroom house for me and my daughter .
" who knows , maybe nine or ten years down the road i 'll be opening my own place and that 's something a year ago i could n't even have dreamed of .
" i 'd like to do for other people what fifteen has done for me .
maybe if they 're lost like i was , i can help them like the foundation helped me . "
the sheer tenacity of a restormel borough council employee was one of the reasons for cornwall being chosen for the second uk training restaurant .
betty hale , the council 's regeneration officer in 2004 , has recently retired , but pursued the fifteen team " relentlessly " , bombarding them with emails and telephone calls until they agreed to come and visit the area .
ms hale was so convinced her county was the perfect venue , she even paid for the flights herself .
she said cornwall had the talent , produce and scenery and jamie oliver had the necessary clout to overcome the hurdles .
pasty problem one of those hurdles was financial , but the south west regional development agency -lrb- swrda -rrb- and objective one in cornwall have provided £ 1m towards the project 's funding .
they believe it will have significant and positive benefits not only for the young trainees , but for the county 's economy which relies heavily on tourism , agriculture and food .
the location of fifteen cornwall is almost certain to help keep the restaurant 's reservations book full , with its spectacular views of coastline and countryside .
diners will also be able to enjoy the more traditional non-edible delights of cornwall , with more than two miles of golden sand and rolling waves which attract surfers and extreme sports enthusiasts from near and far all year round .
however , one thing which will not be found on the menu at fifteen cornwall is a traditional cornish pasty .
mr oliver has reluctantly decided it could lead to complaints from local people telling him they had not been made " properly " .

" well , it 's a slightly different taste , but i 've done it now " , he said .
" it 's been an amazing day .
i 'm so tired because i was far too excited to sleep last night and i kept trying to imagine what it would be like today . "
none of the problems have stopped oliver , who is dyslexic himself , from putting his faith and trust in the ability of these cornish youngsters .
kieran venner is determined to do whatever it takes to justify the trust placed in him and build a secure future for his 16-month-old daughter aimee jade , who he describes as his motivation .
" two years from now i see myself with some money in the bank and hopefully a nice little two-bedroom house for me and my daughter .
andrew bites into cockles to prove he has overcome his fish phobia " who knows , maybe nine or ten years down the road i 'll be opening my own place and that 's something a year ago i could n't even have dreamed of .
" i 'd like to do for other people what fifteen has done for me .
maybe if they 're lost like i was , i can help them like the foundation helped me . "
the sheer tenacity of a restormel borough council employee was one of the reasons for cornwall being chosen for the second uk training restaurant .
betty hale , the council 's regeneration officer in 2004 , has recently retired , but pursued the fifteen team " relentlessly " , bombarding them with emails and telephone calls until they agreed to come and visit the area .
ms hale was so convinced her county was the perfect venue , she even paid for the flights herself .
she said cornwall had the talent , produce and scenery and jamie oliver had the necessary clout to overcome the hurdles .
pasty problem one of those hurdles was financial , but the south west regional development agency -lrb- swrda -rrb- and objective one in cornwall have provided £ 1m towards the project 's funding .
they believe it will have significant and positive benefits not only for the young trainees , but for the county 's economy which relies heavily on tourism , agriculture and food .
the location of fifteen cornwall is almost certain to help keep the restaurant 's reservations book full , with its spectacular views of coastline and countryside .
diners will also be able to enjoy the more traditional non-edible delights of cornwall , with more than two miles of golden sand and rolling waves which attract surfers and extreme sports enthusiasts from near and far all year round .
however , one thing which will not be found on the menu at fifteen cornwall is a traditional cornish pasty .
mr oliver has reluctantly decided it could lead to complaints from local people telling him they had not been made " properly " .

the asian water buffalo , bred near welshpool , weigh about half a tonne each , and they are being used by other organisations to manage the land .
south and west wales wildlife trust has used them to manage scrub land , while buffalo in cheshire graze down dense rush growth to help an rspb bird reserve .
buffalo are more hardy than ordinary cattle and are being used as a grazing tool tony senior , reserves officer at montgomeryshire wildlife trust tony senior , reserves officer with montgomeryshire wildlife trust in welshpool , said native breeds could suffer " health problems " if they were used to graze harsh pasture at the cors dyfi reserve .
the water buffalo , in contrast , graze indiscriminately , create muddy wallows and break up the ground with their hooves .
this makes ideal habitats for birds such as lapwings .
mr senior said : " the reserve was previously a conifer plantation , but the trees have now been felled and the area is becoming a wildlife haven .
" the habitat at the site is made up of open water , swamp , bog , wet woodland , scrub and gorse .
" buffalo are more hardy than ordinary cattle and are being used as a grazing tool .
they like rougher vegetation and are good at eating scrub and gorse . "

the un high commissioner for human rights , louise arbour , said the justice system needed to address its lack of training , independence and integrity .
her comments came at the end of a five-day visit to cambodia .
relations between the un and cambodia have been tense following earlier reports criticising the country 's human rights record .
the timing of ms arbour 's comments could not have been more pertinent , says the bbc 's guy delauney in phnom penh .
the past two weeks have seen lively debate about the qualifications of cambodia 's legal officials , especially those set to preside over the trial of officials linked to the former khmer rouge regime .
some of the judges only hold the equivalent of high school certificates .
others completed their legal training in soviet-bloc countries in the 1980s when cambodia had a communist government , backed by vietnam .
" the problems with the judicial branch of governance are profound , " ms arbour said .
" lack of professional training , insufficient guarantees of independence and lack or perception of lack of integrity are at the heart of what needs to be addressed , both by legislation and by a change of the culture . "
criticism ' unacceptable ' cambodian prime minister hun sen had earlier described un officials in his country as long-term tourists and had accused a special envoy of being deranged .
on thursday however , his spokesman denied reports that the government was planning to close the un 's human rights office in cambodia .
" what the government wants is for the human rights groups to tell the truth about the work the government is doing , to show the facts and avoid just viewing cambodia as hell , " eang sophalleth quoted hun sen as saying .
in march , hun sen called un envoy yash ghai " deranged " after he suggested too much power lay in the hands of the prime minister .
the row erupted in march when mr ghai said cambodia 's government was not committed to human rights , and power had been too centralised around " one individual " .
hun sen said mr ghai should be sacked by un secretary-general kofi annan and dismissed un rights staff in cambodia as " long-term tourists " .
mr sophalleth said hun sen had told ms arbour mr ghai 's comments were out of order .
" the prime minister said it was not acceptable .
if the prime minister does not have power , how can he lead the country ? " he said .

at last week 's e3 games expo in los angeles , the company showcased the games it hopes will fuel its resurgence .

it is dipping its toes into this area with a game for the nintendo ds and gameboy based on the paramount film of charlotte 's web .
" because it is very young and has a slightly female bent , it sits very well under the sega banner , " said mr pritchard .
" but there have been some discussions recently on grander projects . "
mature games one of the challenges for sega is balancing its family-friendly reputation with the pressure to make new games such as condemned : criminal origins for the xbox 360 .
condemned was a visceral and gory crime game , rated as an 18 + .

" it is associated with being fun .

" condemned was the most severe game we 've made .
we need to be careful in those areas , but i do n't think there are areas we would not look at .

the seizures were made during the first six weeks of the campaign operation dry-up , where officers targeted known drinking dens in every angus town .
several adults have also been reported to the procurator fiscal after buying or selling alcohol for youngsters .
concerns have been raised that too many young people in angus suffer from alcohol-related problems .

" a lot of the alcohol consumed by young persons comes from the home , sometimes with the knowledge of parents , or is bought for them by older , legal age friends or siblings , " he said .
" there is a place for parents to teach their children about alcohol in the home and indeed as they get older to offer them small quantities as part of a meal if supervised by adults .

the action , filed in a us federal court in seattle , alleges that microsoft improperly used symantec 's data storage techniques in its own software .
symantec wants compensation , saying the alleged infringement amounts to misappropriation of its trade secrets .
microsoft describes the accusation as unfounded and says it has tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue .
' surreptitiously ' the disagreement is based on symantec 's volume manager software , which allows operating systems to store and handle large amounts of data .
symantec believes microsoft has " deliberately and surreptitiously misappropriated " the technology " and thereby convinced the us government to issue patents to microsoft based on technologies invented by symantec " .
for its part , microsoft says it licensed the technology from veritas software , a company that symantec acquired last year in a $ 13.5bn -lrb- £ 7bn -rrb- deal .
" we are confident that our actions are wholly consistent with the legal agreements between veritas and microsoft and that these claims will be shown to be without merit , " microsoft said in a written statement .

the national college for school leadership says deputies could look after each institution .
national association of head teachers leader mick brookes called the ncsl 's report " extremely unhelpful " .
his union has warned that up to 500,000 children in england attend schools without permanent head teachers .
' a new era ' the ncsl report says schools should be put into larger groups under the control of one head teacher .
several deputies could run one each for a few days a week .
steve munby , chief executive of ncsl , the government-backed training organisation for heads , said : " we are entering a new era in school leadership , which is challenging the long-held assumption that every school needs its own head teacher .
" in future school leadership may not be about just leading individual institutions , but about working in the wider system , although often still having one school as a base . "
the research suggests the " system leadership " approach could offer a solution to recruitment shortages and offer new challenges to existing heads .
the naht has warned that up to 1,200 schools - or 500,000 pupils - are without permanent leaders .
it argues that heads ' workload must be reduced to make the job more attractive .
mr brookes said : " clearly in law every school does require a head teacher .
" to suggest that the answer to the overload of work that head teachers have is simply to delete the post actually beggars belief . "
