military experts have been deployed to curb the disease as the number of infected birds rises to 59 . responding to growing nationwide fears concerning the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu , germany 's chancellor made a surprise visit to a crisis management center on the baltic sea resort of rügen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with the district chief executive of ruegen , kerstin kassner .
" the situation is indeed grave , " merkel said .
" all in all , i 'd say the situation is serious and we will continue monitoring it closely .
if local authorities need assistance , the federal government sands ready to do everything in its powers to help . " meanwhile , 18 new cases of avian influenza were confirmed on the island , bringing the country 's total to 59 .
the number of new cases has skyrocketed in just a few days since the first dead bird was reported on feb .
14 . the agriculture minister in the affected state of mecklenburg-western pommerania , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks as a precautionary measure to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus . " we have to eliminate every possible risk , " backhaus said .

they will disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry official said sunday . all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . responding to criticism the intensified control efforts come after sharp criticism hailed down on local officials for failing to quickly close off areas where dead birds were found or properly police the quarantined zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for agriculture , horst seehofer , left , and till backhaus surrounded by reporters the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this week .
the undeterred flow of media poses one of the biggest risks for spreading the disease , experts warn . " the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich loeffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said . " then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent .

the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the control room of the kalpakkam atomic center within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mittal plans global steel domination mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor .

19 . germany , which is part of the so-called eu-3 with britain and france , has worked to broker a peaceful resolution to the standoff .
earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .

" the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .

south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .

if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand . " organizers ' , however , expect 6,300 exhibitors to fill over 300,000 square meters -lrb- 3,229,173 square feet -rrb- at the march 9 to march 15 event . martin schrader -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trade-fair know-how is hot german export german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .

for them , the idea of rampaging hordes of out-of-control soccer maniacs causing chaos in german cities and damaging the country 's image is the stuff of nightmares . above all , they would like to avoid a replay of what happened at the world cup in 1998 in france , when german rowdies attacked and severely injured policeman daniel nivel . preparatio n , orga n izatio n no one can be sure if behavior can , or will , be avoided at this summer 's event .
but planners are leaving as little as possible to chance .
their approach seems to have been taken right out of some german boy scout handbook : be prepared , and be organized about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a riot between german and english soccer hooligans broke out in belgium in 2000 as often as possible , offenders will be brought before what are being referred to as " accelerated hearings . "
in contrast to usual court cases , a verbal charge is sufficient to bring about such a hearing , and witnesses do not need to appear before the court . state prosecutor klaus bronny , who is in charge of coordinating the judicial preparations for the world cup , said he plans a crackdown on lawbreakers of all sorts .
they will " feel the full force of the law , " he told reporters . catalog of offe n ses " some of the visitors , and some germans of course , will commit criminal offences during the 2006 world cup , " he said .
" and naturally the police and justice officials have to be well prepared . " bronny has already drawn up a catalogue of penalties to apply to all the world cup cities across the board .
foreign visitors who break the law will have to pay a " commensurate security deposit " of between 150 and 1,200 euros . a catalogue of 15 typical offenses - from trespassing to shoplifting to bodily harm - will determine the fine .
in addition , the authorities hope to deter violence as much as possible .
they are already exchanging information with other countries about potential criminals , and travel bans are planned as well . cologne , a world cup city , is used to dealing with football fans of all stripes .
police spokesman jürgen göbel acknowledged that providing security for the world cup is especially important event - germany is especially eager to appear in a good light . big scree n s pose problems " currently people are very interested in the police security plan , " göbel said .
" i have the impression people abroad want to know if they 'll be safe if they travel here to watch the matches . " göbel said he worries about large gatherings , especially around the outdoor large-screen televisions that will be set up for the public to watch the world cup matches .
for the police , the outdoor screens mean constant duty , and a ban on police taking holidays . image of justice and with the speedy hearing system , members of the legal system will also be putting in overtime , and will have to be on hand at the stadiums . not all the judges are ready to accept the new plans , however . " all we need now is for fifa to set the legal penalties during this world cup , " said jürgen mannebeck , a spokesman for the cologne court .
" what about our existing system ?
in germany , we have independent judges who award penalties according to what they think is right . " that 's the image we should be portraying .

in contrast to usual court cases , a verbal charge is sufficient to bring about such a hearing , and witnesses do not need to appear before the court . state prosecutor klaus bronny , who is in charge of coordinating the judicial preparations for the world cup , said he plans a crackdown on lawbreakers of all sorts .
they will " feel the full force of the law , " he told reporters . catalog of offe n ses " some of the visitors , and some germans of course , will commit criminal offences during the 2006 world cup , " he said .

foreign visitors who break the law will have to pay a " commensurate security deposit " of between 150 and 1,200 euros . a catalogue of 15 typical offenses - from trespassing to shoplifting to bodily harm - will determine the fine .

" i have the impression people abroad want to know if they 'll be safe if they travel here to watch the matches . " göbel said he worries about large gatherings , especially around the outdoor large-screen televisions that will be set up for the public to watch the world cup matches .
for the police , the outdoor screens mean constant duty , and a ban on police taking holidays . image of justice and with the speedy hearing system , members of the legal system will also be putting in overtime , and will have to be on hand at the stadiums . not all the judges are ready to accept the new plans , however . " all we need now is for fifa to set the legal penalties during this world cup , " said jürgen mannebeck , a spokesman for the cologne court .
" what about our existing system ?
in germany , we have independent judges who award penalties according to what they think is right . " that 's the image we should be portraying .

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand .

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .
computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .
26 .
economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .
the competitions in sestriere are more like world cup races than olympics .

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand .

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .
computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .
26 .
economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .

for them , the idea of rampaging hordes of out-of-control soccer maniacs causing chaos in german cities and damaging the country 's image is the stuff of nightmares . above all , they would like to avoid a replay of what happened at the world cup in 1998 in france , when german rowdies attacked and severely injured policeman daniel nivel . preparatio n , orga n izatio n no one can be sure if behavior can , or will , be avoided at this summer 's event .
but planners are leaving as little as possible to chance .
their approach seems to have been taken right out of some german boy scout handbook : be prepared , and be organized about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a riot between german and english soccer hooligans broke out in belgium in 2000 as often as possible , offenders will be brought before what are being referred to as " accelerated hearings . "
in contrast to usual court cases , a verbal charge is sufficient to bring about such a hearing , and witnesses do not need to appear before the court . state prosecutor klaus bronny , who is in charge of coordinating the judicial preparations for the world cup , said he plans a crackdown on lawbreakers of all sorts .
they will " feel the full force of the law , " he told reporters . catalog of offe n ses " some of the visitors , and some germans of course , will commit criminal offences during the 2006 world cup , " he said .
" and naturally the police and justice officials have to be well prepared . " bronny has already drawn up a catalogue of penalties to apply to all the world cup cities across the board .
foreign visitors who break the law will have to pay a " commensurate security deposit " of between 150 and 1,200 euros . a catalogue of 15 typical offenses - from trespassing to shoplifting to bodily harm - will determine the fine .

19 . germany , which is part of the so-called eu-3 with britain and france , has worked to broker a peaceful resolution to the standoff .
earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .
but pyongyang has since boycotted the talks . remembering the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean stands guard at an observation post near the demilitarized zone while in south korea , the german minister toured the inter-korean border , the world 's last cold war frontier .
it was a graphic reminder of what it is like to live in a divided nation , something steinmeier remembers all too well from his own country 's experience . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .
" until then , we have lots of work ahead of us , " he said . germany , for its part , hopes it can learn from south korea how to stage a successful soccer world cup .
with just over four months until the tournament arrives in germany , steinmeier is hoping for some advice from south korea , which jointly hosted the 2002 event with japan . before departing for japan on monday , steinmeier will meet south korean president roh moo-hyun . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
iran angry at french claims as merkel calms war fears iran on thursday insisted that it was not seeking a nuclear weapon , rejecting unprecedented accusations by france that its atomic drive was " clandestine " and " military " in nature .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .
pointing out that the media and general public had access to the collection points where the dead birds where discovered , seehofer said efforts to close off the area and prevent the spread of the disease where ineffective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead swans are littering the coast of rügen .
" our immediate responsibility is to contain the disease .
we must make certain it does not spread from wild fowl to livestock , " seehofer stressed .
he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .
the expanded testing of wild birds on rügen showed that swans , whooper swans and geese tested positive for the most deadly strain of avian influenza .
the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .

" we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .
but pyongyang has since boycotted the talks . remembering the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean stands guard at an observation post near the demilitarized zone while in south korea , the german minister toured the inter-korean border , the world 's last cold war frontier .
it was a graphic reminder of what it is like to live in a divided nation , something steinmeier remembers all too well from his own country 's experience . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .
" until then , we have lots of work ahead of us , " he said . germany , for its part , hopes it can learn from south korea how to stage a successful soccer world cup .
with just over four months until the tournament arrives in germany , steinmeier is hoping for some advice from south korea , which jointly hosted the 2002 event with japan . before departing for japan on monday , steinmeier will meet south korean president roh moo-hyun . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .
" until then we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he told steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges north korea and iran to resume diplomacy while on visit in south korea , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged north korea and iran to return to diplomacy and work to end the crises over their nuclear ambitions .

" we both agree that more important than anything is that the iranian nuclear issues should be peacefully resolved through diplomatic efforts and that iran should take a sincere attitude to resolve it , " ban told reporters after meeting with the german minister in seoul on feb .
19 . germany , which is part of the so-called eu-3 with britain and france , has worked to broker a peaceful resolution to the standoff .
earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .
but pyongyang has since boycotted the talks . remembering the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean stands guard at an observation post near the demilitarized zone while in south korea , the german minister toured the inter-korean border , the world 's last cold war frontier .
it was a graphic reminder of what it is like to live in a divided nation , something steinmeier remembers all too well from his own country 's experience . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .
" until then , we have lots of work ahead of us , " he said . germany , for its part , hopes it can learn from south korea how to stage a successful soccer world cup .
with just over four months until the tournament arrives in germany , steinmeier is hoping for some advice from south korea , which jointly hosted the 2002 event with japan . before departing for japan on monday , steinmeier will meet south korean president roh moo-hyun . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
iran angry at french claims as merkel calms war fears iran on thursday insisted that it was not seeking a nuclear weapon , rejecting unprecedented accusations by france that its atomic drive was " clandestine " and " military " in nature .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin .

south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2006 korea reminds germans of cold war divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demilitarized zone evokes memories of the inner-german border during his visit to the demilitarized zone in south korea , german foreign minister steinmeier was reminded of the painful divide his own country ended just 15 years ago . " it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .

the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .

" special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .

" we both agree that more important than anything is that the iranian nuclear issues should be peacefully resolved through diplomatic efforts and that iran should take a sincere attitude to resolve it , " ban told reporters after meeting with the german minister in seoul on feb .
19 . germany , which is part of the so-called eu-3 with britain and france , has worked to broker a peaceful resolution to the standoff .
earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .
but pyongyang has since boycotted the talks . remembering the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean stands guard at an observation post near the demilitarized zone while in south korea , the german minister toured the inter-korean border , the world 's last cold war frontier .
it was a graphic reminder of what it is like to live in a divided nation , something steinmeier remembers all too well from his own country 's experience . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .
" until then , we have lots of work ahead of us , " he said . germany , for its part , hopes it can learn from south korea how to stage a successful soccer world cup .
with just over four months until the tournament arrives in germany , steinmeier is hoping for some advice from south korea , which jointly hosted the 2002 event with japan . before departing for japan on monday , steinmeier will meet south korean president roh moo-hyun . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany : european smoker 's paradise tobacco companies see clouds in germany europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany : a smoker 's paradise in europe ?
while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .

for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .
" until then we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he told steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges north korea and iran to resume diplomacy while on visit in south korea , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged north korea and iran to return to diplomacy and work to end the crises over their nuclear ambitions .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .
" until then we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he told steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges north korea and iran to resume diplomacy while on visit in south korea , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged north korea and iran to return to diplomacy and work to end the crises over their nuclear ambitions .

earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .

accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .

the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .

" our immediate responsibility is to contain the disease .
we must make certain it does not spread from wild fowl to livestock , " seehofer stressed .
he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .

the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .

seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .
pointing out that the media and general public had access to the collection points where the dead birds where discovered , seehofer said efforts to close off the area and prevent the spread of the disease where ineffective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead swans are littering the coast of rügen .
" our immediate responsibility is to contain the disease .
we must make certain it does not spread from wild fowl to livestock , " seehofer stressed .
he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .
the expanded testing of wild birds on rügen showed that swans , whooper swans and geese tested positive for the most deadly strain of avian influenza .
the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .
no poultry has tested positive for the deadly virus , and as far as authorities know , no other domestic birds have shown traces of the disease . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu uncertain about bird flu 's economic consequences will the recent cases of bird flu found in the european union make people eat less poultry ?

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .

" our immediate responsibility is to contain the disease .

he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .

8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .
the expanded testing of wild birds on rügen showed that swans , whooper swans and geese tested positive for the most deadly strain of avian influenza .
the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .
no poultry has tested positive for the deadly virus , and as far as authorities know , no other domestic birds have shown traces of the disease . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu uncertain about bird flu 's economic consequences will the recent cases of bird flu found in the european union make people eat less poultry ?

military experts have been deployed to curb the disease as the number of infected birds rises to 59 . responding to growing nationwide fears concerning the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu , germany 's chancellor made a surprise visit to a crisis management center on the baltic sea resort of rügen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with the district chief executive of ruegen , kerstin kassner .
" the situation is indeed grave , " merkel said .
" all in all , i 'd say the situation is serious and we will continue monitoring it closely .
if local authorities need assistance , the federal government sands ready to do everything in its powers to help . " meanwhile , 18 new cases of avian influenza were confirmed on the island , bringing the country 's total to 59 .
the number of new cases has skyrocketed in just a few days since the first dead bird was reported on feb .
14 . the agriculture minister in the affected state of mecklenburg-western pommerania , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks as a precautionary measure to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus . " we have to eliminate every possible risk , " backhaus said .
the entire island has now been declared a controlled zone . military lends hand on friday germany began enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors .
the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden also have instituted mandatory lock-downs on poultry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu protective zone , the sign reads to help enforce the quarantine zones and prevent the spread of the virus , 19 bundeswehr army specialists have been deployed to rügen .
the anti-nuclear , biological and chemical weapons experts will focus on decontamination efforts .
they will disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry official said sunday . all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . responding to criticism the intensified control efforts come after sharp criticism hailed down on local officials for failing to quickly close off areas where dead birds were found or properly police the quarantined zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for agriculture , horst seehofer , left , and till backhaus surrounded by reporters the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this week .
the undeterred flow of media poses one of the biggest risks for spreading the disease , experts warn . " the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich loeffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said . " then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " growing hysteria the intense media coverage of the dead birds on rügen and rising fears among the population that the disease will spread to the german mainland have caused panic and near hysteria in parts of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all birds are suddenly now under suspicion after merkel and german agriculture minister horst seehofer urged germans to be on the look out for dead birds and to contact authorities , emergency units in berlin said they were swamped by calls from residents reporting dead birds . a four-member fire brigade crew in protective suits rushed to one berlin neighborhood on saturday night to retrieve the carcass of a small blackbird .
" it requires a massive effort every time someone calls the emergency number , " one official said after the corpse was scooped up and taken to a lab for testing . european spread six eu member states have now confirmed the presence of the lethal strain of the virus , which is spreading fast across the continent after surfacing in turkey and central europe .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand . " organizers ' , however , expect 6,300 exhibitors to fill over 300,000 square meters -lrb- 3,229,173 square feet -rrb- at the march 9 to march 15 event . martin schrader -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trade-fair know-how is hot german export german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .

computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .

economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .

concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .

only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .

economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .
the competitions in sestriere are more like world cup races than olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany : european smoker 's paradise tobacco companies see clouds in germany europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany : a smoker 's paradise in europe ?
while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .
pointing out that the media and general public had access to the collection points where the dead birds where discovered , seehofer said efforts to close off the area and prevent the spread of the disease where ineffective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead swans are littering the coast of rügen .
" our immediate responsibility is to contain the disease .
we must make certain it does not spread from wild fowl to livestock , " seehofer stressed .
he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .
the expanded testing of wild birds on rügen showed that swans , whooper swans and geese tested positive for the most deadly strain of avian influenza .
the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .
no poultry has tested positive for the deadly virus , and as far as authorities know , no other domestic birds have shown traces of the disease . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu uncertain about bird flu 's economic consequences will the recent cases of bird flu found in the european union make people eat less poultry ?

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand . " organizers ' , however , expect 6,300 exhibitors to fill over 300,000 square meters -lrb- 3,229,173 square feet -rrb- at the march 9 to march 15 event . martin schrader -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trade-fair know-how is hot german export german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .
pointing out that the media and general public had access to the collection points where the dead birds where discovered , seehofer said efforts to close off the area and prevent the spread of the disease where ineffective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead swans are littering the coast of rügen .

he called for a complete cordoning off of collection points . according to the friedrich loeffler institute , the disease is highly contagious and can easily be picked up and spread when people walk through bird droppings in contaminated areas .
therefore , all individuals with access to the dead birds are required to disinfect their shoes and vehicles passing through the infected areas must be sprayed down with disinfectant .
no one with access to the carcasses is allowed to come in contact with domestic birds , where an outbreak of the disease would be especially detrimental . tests return positive for 41 birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flock of wild geece as it flys over the north german landscape tests so far have confirmed that 30 more birds found dead on the northern german island were infected with the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus .
the expanded testing of wild birds on rügen showed that swans , whooper swans and geese tested positive for the most deadly strain of avian influenza .
the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany : european smoker 's paradise tobacco companies see clouds in germany europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany : a smoker 's paradise in europe ?
while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .

if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .

in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ?

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ?

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .

economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .

concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .
computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .
26 .
economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .

economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .

" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .

seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .
computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .

economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "

observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany : european smoker 's paradise tobacco companies see clouds in germany europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany : a smoker 's paradise in europe ?
while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

but the directors can be forgiven for not opening the champagne after a recent spat of press reports questioning the exhibition 's international importance as big-name companies choose not to attend the event . most of the pressure on deutsche messe , the company that operates cebit , is coming from a lack of companies willing to roll out new products in hanover and fair organizers in rival cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod wo n't be making an appearance at cebit apple introduces its products exclusively at its own us-based macworld , while network giant cisco and the software maker oracle also present their innovations in their own forums - and none of the companies decided to rent out a stand at cebit . domestically , berlin 's international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- , which mainly plays host to entertainment electronics , switched to an annual schedule in 2006 to give exhibitors the opportunity to show their products more often , breaking its long-standing tradition of holding events only once every two years . co n verge n ce causes fair focus problems as electronics continue their penetration into all areas of daily life , the line between computer and entertainment technology blurs , making it difficult for cebit , a trade fair aimed at both retail users and the it elite , to find its focus . displaying the massive influence of personal electronics , cebit 's 2006 " digital living " showcase , which will feature television , game consoles , mp3 players and digital cameras , doubles back onto ifa 's territory , leaving observers to wonder what differentiates one fair from the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samsung exhibited the world 's largest lcd tv at cebit 2005 the electronic convergence is one reason seung kak kang , head of samsung 's german operations , called for a merging of the two fairs into a single technology and electronics mega event . " there is not always time between cebit and ifa to develop new , exciting products , " he told the february edition of impulse magazine .
" that 's why it might make sense if the two would merge . " others would prefer to keep the two events - and their focuses - separate .
an online survey conducted by computerwoche magazine showed nearly 60 percent of its surveyed readers said they would prefer cebit concentrate on information technology and leave consumer electronics , including " digital living " to other venues . cebit still a n importa n t player regardless of how the fair develops over the next 20 years , it still remains a central event many companies choose not to miss . " the exhibition is very , very important for us , " said microsoft 's frank mihm-gebauer . he added microsoft would only consider withdrawing from cebit " if only 50,000 visitors came and only 500 came to our stand . " organizers ' , however , expect 6,300 exhibitors to fill over 300,000 square meters -lrb- 3,229,173 square feet -rrb- at the march 9 to march 15 event . martin schrader -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trade-fair know-how is hot german export german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .

but many are disappointed by low spectator turnout . turin , and italy 's surrounding piedmont region , has been in an economic slump lately ; its flagship employer , carmaker fiat , is in a crisis .
computer and clothing exports are down . now , however , city leaders are predicting medium-term economic benefits from the winter olympic games , which it is hosting through feb .
26 .
economists and government officials used a mathematical model to predict a 4.3 percent boost in growth for 2005 , and 4.2 percent growth in 2006 for the region , especially in the tourism and building sectors . boosting infrastructure according to the model , which was devised by economists from the turin chamber of commerce and the university of rome , growth will continue through 2009 , providing short-and medium-term employment opportunities for thousands of people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turin unveiled an olympic village , including 52 thousand square meters of residences with 750 apartments mauro zangola , a representative of turin chamber of commerce , told the frankfurt allgemeine zeitung that turin 's small size meant the games had a particularly strong economic impact .
concretely , hosting the olympics meant improved infrastructure - for example , a new , driverless subway system was inaugurated to great fanfare .
" many infrastructure projects were planned in any case , " zangola told the faz .
" but they finished quickly for the games .
now they are providing the piedmont region with new life . "
complaints of ' ghost town ' however , athletes and visitors alike have complained that the games are plagued by low spectator turnout , and an accompanying downbeat mood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was well attended , but not much else has been german ski jumper michael uhrmann complained to the faz about a " ghost town feeling " at the games .
only a few thousand spectators were on hand to watch him reach fourth place on sunday .
observers have blamed the apparent lack of interest on high ticket prices and difficulty navigating mountain traffic to reach olympic competition sites like sestriere .
even the local media is giving the games short shrift ; as the olympics got underway , league soccer play was featured more prominently in newspapers .
and italian newspaper la repubblica complained : " the magic of the winter games in lillehammer or salt lake city , when 45,000 spectators came to watch downhill racing alone , is missing .
the competitions in sestriere are more like world cup races than olympics .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .

south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .

he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .

for them , the idea of rampaging hordes of out-of-control soccer maniacs causing chaos in german cities and damaging the country 's image is the stuff of nightmares . above all , they would like to avoid a replay of what happened at the world cup in 1998 in france , when german rowdies attacked and severely injured policeman daniel nivel . preparatio n , orga n izatio n no one can be sure if behavior can , or will , be avoided at this summer 's event .
but planners are leaving as little as possible to chance .
their approach seems to have been taken right out of some german boy scout handbook : be prepared , and be organized about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a riot between german and english soccer hooligans broke out in belgium in 2000 as often as possible , offenders will be brought before what are being referred to as " accelerated hearings . "
in contrast to usual court cases , a verbal charge is sufficient to bring about such a hearing , and witnesses do not need to appear before the court . state prosecutor klaus bronny , who is in charge of coordinating the judicial preparations for the world cup , said he plans a crackdown on lawbreakers of all sorts .
they will " feel the full force of the law , " he told reporters . catalog of offe n ses " some of the visitors , and some germans of course , will commit criminal offences during the 2006 world cup , " he said .
" and naturally the police and justice officials have to be well prepared . " bronny has already drawn up a catalogue of penalties to apply to all the world cup cities across the board .
foreign visitors who break the law will have to pay a " commensurate security deposit " of between 150 and 1,200 euros . a catalogue of 15 typical offenses - from trespassing to shoplifting to bodily harm - will determine the fine .
in addition , the authorities hope to deter violence as much as possible .
they are already exchanging information with other countries about potential criminals , and travel bans are planned as well . cologne , a world cup city , is used to dealing with football fans of all stripes .
police spokesman jürgen göbel acknowledged that providing security for the world cup is especially important event - germany is especially eager to appear in a good light . big scree n s pose problems " currently people are very interested in the police security plan , " göbel said .
" i have the impression people abroad want to know if they 'll be safe if they travel here to watch the matches . " göbel said he worries about large gatherings , especially around the outdoor large-screen televisions that will be set up for the public to watch the world cup matches .
for the police , the outdoor screens mean constant duty , and a ban on police taking holidays . image of justice and with the speedy hearing system , members of the legal system will also be putting in overtime , and will have to be on hand at the stadiums . not all the judges are ready to accept the new plans , however . " all we need now is for fifa to set the legal penalties during this world cup , " said jürgen mannebeck , a spokesman for the cologne court .
" what about our existing system ?
in germany , we have independent judges who award penalties according to what they think is right . " that 's the image we should be portraying .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" we both agree that more important than anything is that the iranian nuclear issues should be peacefully resolved through diplomatic efforts and that iran should take a sincere attitude to resolve it , " ban told reporters after meeting with the german minister in seoul on feb .
19 . germany , which is part of the so-called eu-3 with britain and france , has worked to broker a peaceful resolution to the standoff .
earlier this month , though , the un international atomic energy agency voted to refer iran to the un security council . resuming six-party talks steinmeier , who arrived in south korea as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to japan and china , expressed concern about the stalemate in six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear program . " we urge north korea to return to the negotiations table again and constructively take part in the six-party talks again , " he said at the joint press conference . the multilateral talks , which group the two koreas , the united states , china , russia and japan , produced a joint statement in september on disarming north korea 's nuclear weapons in return for diplomatic , security and energy aid guarantees to the impoverished nation .
but pyongyang has since boycotted the talks . remembering the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean stands guard at an observation post near the demilitarized zone while in south korea , the german minister toured the inter-korean border , the world 's last cold war frontier .
it was a graphic reminder of what it is like to live in a divided nation , something steinmeier remembers all too well from his own country 's experience . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it is like to live in a divided country , " the minister said . the demiliarized zone is a heavily fortified frontier that stretches coast to coast across the korean peninsula .
more than a million north korean troops face 690,000 south korean soldiers and about 30,000 us troops . comparing the two countries ' divided history , the south korean foreign minister said his country had studied germany 's experience closely in the past 15 years , but declined to say how long it would take before his own country was unified . learning from each other south korea 's ban said the two koreas were in the first phase of exchanges and cooperation and that two further phases culminating in eventual unification lay ahead .
" until then , we have lots of work ahead of us , " he said . germany , for its part , hopes it can learn from south korea how to stage a successful soccer world cup .
with just over four months until the tournament arrives in germany , steinmeier is hoping for some advice from south korea , which jointly hosted the 2002 event with japan . before departing for japan on monday , steinmeier will meet south korean president roh moo-hyun . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the control room of the kalpakkam atomic center within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mittal plans global steel domination mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor .

the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest .

the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .
bätzing has also announced an anti-smoking campaign to be installed in stadiums hosting world cup games this summer . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .
" until then we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he told steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges north korea and iran to resume diplomacy while on visit in south korea , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged north korea and iran to return to diplomacy and work to end the crises over their nuclear ambitions .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .

" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .
she stressed , however , that something must change in the minds of germans before not smoking becomes public policy .

while britain becomes the latest european country to prohibit smoking in public places , germany seems adamant about clinging to the unhealthy habit . british lawmakers voted by a huge margin this week to ban smoking in pubs , restaurants , factories and other indoor public spaces in england .
spain kicked off the new year by partially kicking the habit : smoking is now prohibited in enclosed areas such as food shops and workplaces .
over the past few years , ireland , italy , norway , malta and sweden have also banned smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is a no-no in pubs in britain , one out of every four adults smokes - half as many as three decades ago .
britain was also a pioneer in the 1980s in requiring warning labels on cigarettes packages .
according to the afp news agency , a near-end 2005 survey showed that 70 percent of britons welcomed the public smoking ban . smoking under siege ? as in britain , the number of smokers in most european countries has been steadily declining for years .
still , diseases resulting from tobacco use claim the lives of more than 600,000 people on the continent annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no smoking in madrid 's subway but new laws to ban the habit and improve public health are not welcomed everywhere .
in spain - europe 's second largest consumer of tobacco - is having a tough time enforcing the ban .
many of madrid 's smaller bars have the option of permitting smoking , or prohibiting it throughout .
most bars still opt for allowing smoking .
spanish laws require only bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters to have non-smoking areas . some employers , however , are taking the hard-core approach .
el mundo newspaper employees caught breaking the smoking ban at the workplace , for instance , risk a fine of 30 euros .
a repeat offense , however , could cost a staggering 10,000 euros . bad habits die hard in germany whereas the rest of the continent seems to be making at least some headway against smokers , germany is still a relative haven for those who like to light up . why , in an otherwise relatively health and environment-conscious country , is germany still indulging its smokers , even though smoking is a habit that the european commission has called " the single largest cause of avoidable death in the european union ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temptation to smoke is great for some even france , which has not yet imposed a nation-wide ban on public smoking , enforces a ban on it in most forms of public transportion and in offices .
in contrast , germany permits smoking in workplaces , unless a non-smoking employee protests .
pressure from smoking colleagues , however , makes it hard for non-smokers to speak up . germany still in the smoke-filled dark ages ? a legal ban on smoking in public buildings and restaurants in germany does not appear to be on the horizon , even though smoking kills 110,000 to 140,000 people each year in the nation .
passive smoke also puts non-smokers at risk of lung cancer and narrowing of the arteries , among other things . a recent study by the german cancer research center in heidelberg showed at least nine people die every day in germany due to passive smoke-related diseases .
that translates into more than 3,300 a year . the government prefers to rely on campaigns encouraging people to voluntarily refrain from smoking .
however , health economics expert karl lauterbach of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- believes german restaurants , for example , will never install non-smoking areas unless they are required to do so by law : " i do n't believe in a million years that restaurants will create smoking and non-smoking areas of their own accord , " he said . to regulate or not to regulate ? the german hotel and restaurant association has told the german ministry for health that its restaurant owner-members will create smoking and non-smoking areas in their eateries by march 2008 .
the association is expected to present a progress report to the german government this march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad maria eichhorn , drug commissioner for the christian democrats parliamentary party , wants to wait out the results of the restaurants ' self-imposed smoking regulations .
if that does n't work , then " non-smoking bans must be put in place by law , " she said . restaurant owners have often argued in the past that a smoking ban would result in few visitors .
however , the irish restaurant association found that the amount of business remained the same even after smoking was prohibited in public places in the country . strong tobacco lobby perhaps one reason german politicians are reluctant to introduce non-smoking laws is due to the possible power tobacco company lobbyists may hold over them .
according to the newspaper berliner zeitung , tobacco giant philip morris sponsors food and drink at every party convention in germany .
tobacco companies pay for political parties ' election posters and special evening functions , the paper recently wrote .
lobbyists also " work " politicians , arguing that it is not in the best interest of the country if the 14.4 billion euros -lrb- in 2005 alone -rrb- drawn in by taxes on tobacco were to fall away . on the other hand , experts estimate that smoking and its -lrb- health -rrb- consequences costs the national economy 50 million euros annually . a rebellious germany germany has also been defiant compared to its european neighbors when it comes to prohibiting tobacco advertising .
in 2003 , the european parliament passed a directive banning tobacco advertising in print media , on the radio and the internet .
at the beginning of this month , the european commission said it would take action against germany -lrb- and luxembourg -rrb- for failing to implement the directive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission campaign against smoking sabine bätzing , of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and current drug commissioner at the ministry for health and social security , is one german politician who is intent on seeing her anti-smoking campaign through .
she told mainz 's allgemeine zeitung in december 2005 that she wants to see non-smokers become " mainstream " in german society . " i would like people to not have to apologize for not being a smoker , " she told the newspaper .
" we 're working on a project called ' a smoke-free society ' and on other projects to stop smoking in hospitals and schools , " she said . bätzing said prevention is the best method to keep young people from picking up the habit .

the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mittal plans global steel domination mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor .

efforts to contain the disease have top priority , he said . after visiting the baltic sea island of rügen , german agriculture minister horst seehofer told health and veterinary officials in the rest of the country to be rigorous in enforcing measures to lock down all domestic birds and keep track of reported carcasses .
" we must expect that this will expand to other geographical areas , " he said at a news conference on friday , urging state governments to prepare for a worst-case scenario . " there will be zero tolerance , " he added and warned that the rapidly spreading h5n1 virus , which so far has only infected migratory birds in germany , could easily jump over to poultry livestock .
from that point , it is also possible the disease could spread to humans . poor crisis management on saturday , the minister sharply criticized the ineffective containment strategy on the island .

the results follow previously confirmed cases earlier in the week . as of feb 19 , the number of confirmed cases of h5n1 had climbed to 41 . the agriculture ministry reported on friday that one of the dead swans discovered on feb .
8 and tested for the worst strain of h5n1 had been ringed in latvia last august .
seehofer said this fact gave rise to a theory that the virus was " being spread from east to west . " so far , the virus has only appeared in migratory fowl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2006 korea reminds germans of cold war divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demilitarized zone evokes memories of the inner-german border during his visit to the demilitarized zone in south korea , german foreign minister steinmeier was reminded of the painful divide his own country ended just 15 years ago . " it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .
the next phase is alliance and than unification .
" until then we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he told steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany urges north korea and iran to resume diplomacy while on visit in south korea , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged north korea and iran to return to diplomacy and work to end the crises over their nuclear ambitions .

" it 's like taking a trip back into a suppressed period of time , " frank-walter steinmeier said as his eyes surveyed the barbed wire , the mine fields and the watch towers dividing the two koreas .
for decades , the 38th parallel has separated the poverty-stricken communist north korea from the economically prosperous south korea . the german foreign minister referred to the border running from coast-to-coast across the peninsula as a " death strip " and recalled germany 's own division , the armed border and the berlin wall .
but they all came down in 1989 when germany was reunited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers on patrol the heavily guarded border between the two koreas serves as the last remainder of the cold war . a cold war frontier the tour along the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , a 241-kilometer long and four-kilometer wide stretch of no-man 's land , was for steinmeier like a trip back into germany 's own past .
escorted by a squad of police motorcycles , the foreign minister passed the tongil bridge -lrb- the bridge of unity -rrb- and control points such as " charlie " - like the former checkpoint on the friedrichstrasse in downtown berlin . " the german delegation , along with traveling journalists , was reminded when it viewed the demilitarized zone what it was like to live in a divided country , " the minister said at a press conference in seoul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- but whereas germany has enjoyed unification between the former communist east and the democratic west for over 15 years , more than a million armed soldiers stand along the dmz .
south korea and north korea are still at war with each other .
even 53 years after the end of the korean war , there is still no peace treaty . striving for unification " unification is a great wish for all citizens on the peninsula , " steinmeier 's counterpart ban ki moon told his german visitor .
south korea has always regarded german unification as a model of what it would like to achieve , he said . comparing the two countries ' divided history , ban said south korea had studied germany 's unification experience closely over the past 15 years .
if it at some point in the future the two koreas should actually decide to unite , south korea will be forced to carry the weight of the economic costs - as was the case for west germany . just as unification had its opponents in germany , many business leaders in south korea have a more sober approach to unification .
they fear tremendous costs and loss of competition on the global market while they pay to bring the impoverished north korea up to par . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's army on military parade the german slogan from 1989 , " we are one people , " is rarely shouted with enthusiasm in both parts of the korean peninsula .
in the north , western observers report a deep-rooted indoctrination and mistrust of the capitalistic oriented southern neighbors . but ban ki moon is optimistic the goal will be reached one day .
he speaks of several phases on the road to unification .
at the moment , the two koreas are in the midst of the first phase of communication and exchange .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2006 india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the control room of the kalpakkam atomic center within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal . the french president arrived in india feb .
19 for a whistle-stop visit aimed at improving ties with the emerging economic powerhouse .
accompanied by no less than five ministers and 32 business executives , chirac has said he will seek to boost trade levels with asia 's third-largest economy . among those traveling in the french delegation are representatives from the nuclear power station builder areva , which hopes talks between fuel-hungry india and france , which relies on nuclear power for its energy needs , will lead to new business possibilities .
prior to his arrival , chirac said future civilian nuclear technology cooperation was a goal for his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant in ahmedabad , india " if we do n't help india produce electricity using nuclear power , we would let india develop into a chimney for greenhouse gases , " the french leader said saturday . nuclear vs. fossil fuel referring to the expanding demands for energy in india and the rapid consumption of fossil fuels , chirac explained " the minimum we must do is to let india respond to its energy needs without becoming a major polluting nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in flamanville , normandy france , which is a strong advocate for atomic energy in europe , would like to help india develop its nuclear power potentials within the framework of the non-proliferation agreement .
as chirac and representatives from areva have recognized , french nuclear companies stand to profit greatly if such a cooperation came into existence . chirac , who last visited india eight years ago , and prime minister manmohan singh are due to sign a declaration on the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on tuesday . stumbling blocks india , however , has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and until a landmark indo-us agreement to supply new delhi with long-denied civilian nuclear technology is approved by the us congress there can be no deals with paris . nuclear cooperation between france and india hinges on a breakthrough in deadlocked talks between new delhi and washington .
the two sides are at odds over us demands for india to open up more of its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
according to the rules of the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- – of which paris is a key member – france will not be able to sell export-restricted nuclear technology to india until there is agreement with the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's supersonic cruise missiles are capable of reaching pakistan stephen cohen from the washington-based brookings institute told dw-world that the us is inclined to hammer out a deal with india but had to make " absolutely certain that no delivered material may be used for a weapons program . " special status for india ? in an interview with india today , chirac came out strong in favor of offering nuclear assistance to india .
" the recognition of a special status for india through the nsg is a high priority , " he said . but critics fear such an agreement would water down the non-proliferation treaty .
according to ian anthony from the stockholm international peace research institute , if trade with a nuclear power is possible even though it has not signed the npt , other countries will question the worth of the npt . thorny issues on horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor steel plant in differdange , luxembourg chirac 's ability to press ahead with closer ties to india through favorable nuclear deals may be overshadowed by another thorny issue – concern in india over the frosty reaction in france and europe to indian billionaire lakshmi mittal 's bid for european steel giant arcelor . leaders in india have been strongly protesting the interference of french and other european governments in the ongoing plans for mittal steel to take over the luxembourg-based arcelor .
the european steel group is owned in part by several eu member states such as luxembourg and france , and a good number of jobs are tied up in the company . last week , indian trade minister kamal nath warned european nations opposing the bid , which would forge the world 's largest steel group , not to consider the color of a person 's skin .
french government officials insist mittal 's nationality is not a factor , with chirac citing concern over the loss of jobs and saying the takeover would not be in arcelor 's " best interest . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mittal plans global steel domination mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor .

but the rolling stones had just given the hands of time a much bigger wrench on rio de janeiro 's copacabana beach .
in front of more than a million people and a flotilla of boats they belted out their timeless hits of the 60s and 70s .
rio no doubt wishes it could go back to that golden age .
the city has taken a double blow in recent decades ; losing its status as brazil 's capital on top of suffering the effects of the country 's crises .
misgivings economic growth has not kept pace with population rise and public infrastructure has crumbled .
for these reasons there were major misgivings about the stones staging a free show on copacabana beach .
dangerous forces could be unleashed in a setting that pays full testimony to the wonder of nature and the follies of man .
the prestigious jornal do brasil newspaper spoke of a monumental challenge for rio " the responsibility is as big as the expected crowd .
there is no room for error . "
" it seemed that all of rio had converged on copacabana " rolling stones in giant rio gig in pictures : stones in rio the city seems to have passed the test .
of course , there were incidents .
local resident ursula ribeiro , 23 , said : " my friend had her bag snatched , and after that it was hard to relax and enjoy the show . "
her friend jean mello , 26 , also complained of " poor organisation - there were just too many people " .
crushes were caused by the presence of so many informal stands offering hot dogs , drinks and pirate merchandise .
it seemed that all of rio had converged on copacabana , either to enjoy the show or to make money from it .
the stands took up space that was needed fro the flow of people .
" i saw some people having problems breathing , " said jean mello .
" but it was hard for them to get out of the crowd because all these stands were in the way .
but on the whole i think the show was a success , " he continued .
this seemed to be the consensus of opinion .
" people came from all over brazil and the world , the sound could not be faulted , lots of people had a good time and the images on the dvd they 're producing will be a good advert for the city , " he said .
the usual defects of a free show were in evidence .
only vips and fanatics who camped out overnight got much of a view .
the rest had to put up with giant screens that were slightly out of sync . "
there can be few better opening songs than jumping jack flash " and however good the sound system , it still had to compete with the helicopter overhead and the yells of hundreds of wandering salesman offering " stupidly cold beer " .
but there can be few better opening songs than jumping jack flash and from its introductory riff the crowd were ready to perform the challenging feat of dancing on sand .
and they kept it up to the end .
four of the 20 songs were taken from the latest album .
in the main , though , the stones stuck to their late 1960s and early 1970s creative peak .
one of their most laudable aspects , the constant readiness to pay tribute to the black american music that inspired them , was once more in evidence .
adrenalin rush they covered ray charles ' the night time .
with its samba inspired rhythm , sympathy for the devil was another high point .
that and miss you were the songs most sung and whistled on my tube ride home .
perhaps the only disappointment was the absence of stage favourite gimme shelter .
but the stones were staying in the superplush copacabana palace , a short stroll from the stage , so seeking a roof over their heads was hardly a priority .
once they had finished off with satisfaction and taken their bows they could make that stroll with pride .
they had rocked them on the beach , rolled them in the boats , and given more than a million people an adrenalin rush that will never fade .

the group entertained with many of their back catalogue of hits .
but the rolling stones had just given the hands of time a much bigger wrench on rio de janeiro 's copacabana beach .
in front of more than a million people and a flotilla of boats they belted out their timeless hits of the 60s and 70s .
rio no doubt wishes it could go back to that golden age .
the city has taken a double blow in recent decades ; losing its status as brazil 's capital on top of suffering the effects of the country 's crises .
misgivings economic growth has not kept pace with population rise and public infrastructure has crumbled .
for these reasons there were major misgivings about the stones staging a free show on copacabana beach .
dangerous forces could be unleashed in a setting that pays full testimony to the wonder of nature and the follies of man .
the prestigious jornal do brasil newspaper spoke of a monumental challenge for rio " the responsibility is as big as the expected crowd .
there is no room for error . "
it seemed that all of rio had converged on copacabana rolling stones in giant rio gig in pictures : stones in rio the city seems to have passed the test .
of course , there were incidents .
local resident ursula ribeiro , 23 , said : " my friend had her bag snatched , and after that it was hard to relax and enjoy the show . "
her friend jean mello , 26 , also complained of " poor organisation - there were just too many people " .
crushes were caused by the presence of so many informal stands offering hot dogs , drinks and pirate merchandise .
it seemed that all of rio had converged on copacabana , either to enjoy the show or to make money from it .
the stands took up space that was needed fro the flow of people .
" i saw some people having problems breathing , " said jean mello .
the action on stage was difficult for many in the crowds to see " but it was hard for them to get out of the crowd because all these stands were in the way .
but on the whole i think the show was a success , " he continued .
this seemed to be the consensus of opinion .
" people came from all over brazil and the world , the sound could not be faulted , lots of people had a good time and the images on the dvd they 're producing will be a good advert for the city , " he said .
the usual defects of a free show were in evidence .
only vips and fanatics who camped out overnight got much of a view .
the rest had to put up with giant screens that were slightly out of sync .
there can be few better opening songs than jumping jack flash and however good the sound system , it still had to compete with the helicopter overhead and the yells of hundreds of wandering salesman offering " stupidly cold beer " .
but there can be few better opening songs than jumping jack flash and from its introductory riff the crowd were ready to perform the challenging feat of dancing on sand .
and they kept it up to the end .
four of the 20 songs were taken from the latest album .
in the main , though , the stones stuck to their late 1960s and early 1970s creative peak .
one of their most laudable aspects , the constant readiness to pay tribute to the black american music that inspired them , was once more in evidence .
adrenalin rush they covered ray charles ' the night time .
with its samba inspired rhythm , sympathy for the devil was another high point .
that and miss you were the songs most sung and whistled on my tube ride home .
perhaps the only disappointment was the absence of stage favourite gimme shelter .
but the stones were staying in the superplush copacabana palace , a short stroll from the stage , so seeking a roof over their heads was hardly a priority .
once they had finished off with satisfaction and taken their bows they could make that stroll with pride .
they had rocked them on the beach , rolled them in the boats , and given more than a million people an adrenalin rush that will never fade .
