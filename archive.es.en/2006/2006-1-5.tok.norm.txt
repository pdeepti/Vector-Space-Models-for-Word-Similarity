" the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

" two people have therefore died of bird flu in van , " the doctor said . authorities confirmed late wednesday that the boy , muhammed ali kocyigit , had died from bird flu .
it was the first known human fatality from the disease outside southeast asia and china , where it has killed more than 70 people since late 2003 , nearly 40 of them in 2005 alone . seven other people , including two other members of the kocyigit family , are still being treated in van for bird flu-like symptoms . health minister recep akdag said wednesday night that members of the family had eaten diseased chickens . family 's village on the flightpath of migratory birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish vet disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

" the european union and the united states fear iran 's civil nuclear program is a cover for developing a nuclear bomb .
tehran denies the accusation , insisting the program is designed solely to meet its electricity needs . iaea director mohamed el baradei called earlier this week for " clarifications " on the letter , saying it was essential that iran refrain from " all activities linked to uranium enrichment . " " senior technical people are coming from iran who would presumably help us sort this out , " el baradei said . a meeting initially planned for wednesday was postponed , but a senior iaea official confirmed thursday that talks were underway . explanations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's uranim conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate " there are meetings planned over the next couple of days , focused on clarifying the letter and in particular what the resumption of -lrb- research and development -rrb- means , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . the iaea wants to know whether tehran is seeking to remove seals the un atomic watchdog has placed on iranian nuclear facilities . in august 2005 , the iaea supervised the removal by iran of the un seal from its isfahan plant , thus enabling it to resume conversion of uranium into gas . this is a first step in the process of making enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civilian reactors as well as the explosive core in nuclear bombs . belligerent rhetoric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated thursday that his country would not retreat from it nuclear program , echoing a statement by ali larijani , iran 's top official for nuclear issues , on wednesday that resumption of nuclear research was " not negotiable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is known for his fiery speeches " those who have nuclear weapons and have used them in the worst way against people in the world , have no right to prevent nations from achieving peaceful nuclear energy , " the ultra-conservative president told a cheering audience in the religious epicentre of qom . this sparked alarmed reactions from france and germany , which are trying with britain to wean iran off its nuclear ambitions by offering economic and security incentives . a point of no return ? both berlin and paris warned that iran 's decision to resume atomic fuel research despite western opposition could endanger the next round of talks on its controversial nuclear program with three eu nations , due to begin again in austria on jan .
18 . " we view the latest announcement from iran that it will restart its research and development work with concern , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference on wednesday . the resumption of enrichment would be regarded by the west as a point of no return , triggering the implementation of a resolution referring iran to the un security council for violating the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the europeans and the united states are backing a compromise offer from moscow to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil , thus giving iran access to the nuclear fuel cycle while ensuring its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . iranian officials have criticized the proposal but not ruled it out entirely , and are scheduled to discuss it with russian officials on saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu opposes iranian move on nuclear research iran has said it will resume its nuclear research activities next week , despite western opposition .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 chinese cars pick up speed in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's automobiles are making their way to germany 's autobahns even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory . the cars from chinese manufactures geely , jiangling and brilliance that germans saw at last year 's frankfurt iaa auto exhibition - some of which will be popping up again next week at the detroit auto show - ca n't match their german competitors for now , but it wo n't be long until they do , according to ferdinand dudenhöffer of germany 's center for automotive research . " the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ? " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de automakers eye the new competitor : china the chinese " dragon " is coming to europe , one of the new affordable cars made in china by manufacturers who honed their skills working for western carmakers .
but analysts see no immediate threat from this new competitor .
-lrb- sept .
14 , 2005 -rrb- automotive wind of change from china for years , europe has spoken of china 's importance as the future market for almost everything .
now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ?
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- chinese cars to hit european market in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 germany committed to phasing out nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will get rid of its nuclear power plants the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out . chancellor angela merkel remains committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , her spokesperson thomas steg said on wednesday . in the aftermath of the bitter dispute between russia and ukraine over gas prices , which starkly exposed europe 's overwhelming dependence on russian gas , some of merkel 's ministers , notably members of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - argued that research into nuclear energy should continue despite the previous government ’ s decision to phase out this energy source over the next two decades . the conservative parties , however , have practically no maneuvering space left on this issue .
both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?
" the criminal police is carrying out a full investigation and gathering relevant information they can , " said the region ’ s police chief , hubertus andrä . " two people , who were previously still in shock , are now in the position to be questioned in the investigation .
they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .

he said no one had warned of any risk of the roof being unstable and that the snow removal was only a precautionary measure . the town 's mayor , wolfgang heitmeier , has rejected accusations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open , saying the roof had been examined hours before it collapsed and the amount of snow on it was within safety limits .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems and said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . reactions to the accident bavaria 's regional interior ministry on wednesday rejected calls for safety certificates for buildings .
it said the cause of the accident needed to be determined before measures could be taken . the tragedy occurred on monday shortly before the rink was due to close for the day . grieving residents are calling for those responsible to be identified and punished and messages of condolence are flooding into the town 's web site . pope benedict xvi , who was born in the state of bavaria , where the accident happened , sent a telegram to the archbishop of munich on wednesday to convey his condolences .

" the european union and the united states fear iran 's civil nuclear program is a cover for developing a nuclear bomb .
tehran denies the accusation , insisting the program is designed solely to meet its electricity needs . iaea director mohamed el baradei called earlier this week for " clarifications " on the letter , saying it was essential that iran refrain from " all activities linked to uranium enrichment . " " senior technical people are coming from iran who would presumably help us sort this out , " el baradei said . a meeting initially planned for wednesday was postponed , but a senior iaea official confirmed thursday that talks were underway . explanations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's uranim conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate " there are meetings planned over the next couple of days , focused on clarifying the letter and in particular what the resumption of -lrb- research and development -rrb- means , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . the iaea wants to know whether tehran is seeking to remove seals the un atomic watchdog has placed on iranian nuclear facilities . in august 2005 , the iaea supervised the removal by iran of the un seal from its isfahan plant , thus enabling it to resume conversion of uranium into gas . this is a first step in the process of making enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civilian reactors as well as the explosive core in nuclear bombs . belligerent rhetoric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated thursday that his country would not retreat from it nuclear program , echoing a statement by ali larijani , iran 's top official for nuclear issues , on wednesday that resumption of nuclear research was " not negotiable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .

" it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .
the election campaign was opened this week . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .

" both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .

political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .

dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets .

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

" this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 germany committed to phasing out nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will get rid of its nuclear power plants the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out . chancellor angela merkel remains committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , her spokesperson thomas steg said on wednesday . in the aftermath of the bitter dispute between russia and ukraine over gas prices , which starkly exposed europe 's overwhelming dependence on russian gas , some of merkel 's ministers , notably members of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - argued that research into nuclear energy should continue despite the previous government ’ s decision to phase out this energy source over the next two decades . the conservative parties , however , have practically no maneuvering space left on this issue .
both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?
" the criminal police is carrying out a full investigation and gathering relevant information they can , " said the region ’ s police chief , hubertus andrä . " two people , who were previously still in shock , are now in the position to be questioned in the investigation .
they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .
der tagesspiegel newspaper cited meteorologists on wednesday as saying there must have been about 180 tons of snow on the roof when it gave way . a case of negligence ? the events leading up to the collapse of the roof remained unclear on wednesday . the coach of a local ice hockey club , thomas rumpeltes , has said he was told the snow was to have been cleared from the roof shortly before it caved in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue efforts were often interrupted by bad weather rumpeltes said he had cancelled practice at the rink for a youth team because the authorities had told him of the impending clearance shortly before the accident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

then on jan .
1 , when the gas giant gazprom turned off the flow of fuel , ukraine responded by funneling off its required amount from the pipeline transgressing its country on way to western europe .
all across central europe , energy providers registered a drop in pressure and consumers worried the supply was in danger of being cut .
a gas war - or at least a war of words and threats - erupted as politicians in germany and elsewhere began to question dependency on russia for a steady supply of gas .
some pointed to alternative sources of energy , while others recommended a return to nuclear energy .
the dispute is forcing european governments to face up to the dangers that result from coupling energy policy with foreign policy .
dw-world summarizes the main issues of the gas dispute . dw-world.de moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row russia and ukraine struck a five-year gas supply deal wednesday , ending a long-standing fractious dispute over pricing and designed to guarantee supplies to kiev as well as to europe .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .
the election campaign was opened this week . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's naftogaz chief ivchenko , left , and russia 's gazprom chief miller struck the deal in moscow these concerns appeared to prompt an announcement by ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov later wednesday that naftogaz and rosukrenergo would create another joint venture for deliveries of turkmen and russian gas to ukraine and moldova . amid long-standing rumors of corruption in transit of gas from turkmenistan , rosukrenergo has had a patchy reputation .
a former head of ukraine 's secret service has accused the company of money-laundering , a charge it has denied . asked by afp about the future role of rosukrenergo , a naftogaz official , requesting anonymity , pointed out that russia had previously been able to disrupt deliveries from turkmenistan by virtue of the fact that turkmenistan 's main export pipelines cross russian territory . " we bought turkmen gas … but then had problems with supplies , " the official said , acknowledging , however , that the situation now is " not great .

" two people have therefore died of bird flu in van , " the doctor said . authorities confirmed late wednesday that the boy , muhammed ali kocyigit , had died from bird flu .
it was the first known human fatality from the disease outside southeast asia and china , where it has killed more than 70 people since late 2003 , nearly 40 of them in 2005 alone . seven other people , including two other members of the kocyigit family , are still being treated in van for bird flu-like symptoms . health minister recep akdag said wednesday night that members of the family had eaten diseased chickens . family 's village on the flightpath of migratory birds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish vet disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa .
the kocyigit family is from the remote town of dogubeyazit , near turkey 's borders with iran and armenia and about 100 km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- south of aralik , a village on the flight path of migratory birds blamed for the spread of the epidemic . aralik was put under quarantine last week after fowl there tested positive for the h5 strain of bird flu . officials were still awaiting the results of further tests being conducted in london to determine whether any of some 750 birds slaughtered in the village suffered from the h5n1 strain of bird flu , which can be deadly to humans . first h5n1 case in turkey reported in october the first case of h5n1 in the country was uncovered in october at a turkey farm in kiziksa , a village in the northeastern province of balikesir , abutting a wildlife reserve that is a well-known stopover for migratory birds . officials in ankara said on december 9 that they had eradicated the avian flu virus in that region after testing thousands of samples and culling 10,000 birds . experts say the feared h5n1 virus could merge with human strains of flu to create a global outbreak that could kill millions of people around the world . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the shadow of bird flu remains despite lack of publicity the threat to europe from bird flu made all the headlines in october but has since dropped down the news agenda .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .
the election campaign was opened this week . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 new rules for muslims in german state blasted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart wants to know if muslims are committed to the constitution getting german citizenship usually means signing an oath of allegiance to the constitution .
not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .

they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 new rules for muslims in german state blasted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart wants to know if muslims are committed to the constitution getting german citizenship usually means signing an oath of allegiance to the constitution .
not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .
the election campaign was opened this week . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

" the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 new rules for muslims in german state blasted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart wants to know if muslims are committed to the constitution getting german citizenship usually means signing an oath of allegiance to the constitution .
not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .

" it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?

they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .

he said his thoughts were with relatives " after this tragic accident which cost the lives mostly of children , " and wished the injured a speedy recovery . according to local radio , a memorial service will be held tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for causes of ice rink disaster rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .

" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .

" the european union and the united states fear iran 's civil nuclear program is a cover for developing a nuclear bomb .
tehran denies the accusation , insisting the program is designed solely to meet its electricity needs . iaea director mohamed el baradei called earlier this week for " clarifications " on the letter , saying it was essential that iran refrain from " all activities linked to uranium enrichment . " " senior technical people are coming from iran who would presumably help us sort this out , " el baradei said . a meeting initially planned for wednesday was postponed , but a senior iaea official confirmed thursday that talks were underway . explanations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's uranim conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate " there are meetings planned over the next couple of days , focused on clarifying the letter and in particular what the resumption of -lrb- research and development -rrb- means , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . the iaea wants to know whether tehran is seeking to remove seals the un atomic watchdog has placed on iranian nuclear facilities . in august 2005 , the iaea supervised the removal by iran of the un seal from its isfahan plant , thus enabling it to resume conversion of uranium into gas . this is a first step in the process of making enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civilian reactors as well as the explosive core in nuclear bombs . belligerent rhetoric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated thursday that his country would not retreat from it nuclear program , echoing a statement by ali larijani , iran 's top official for nuclear issues , on wednesday that resumption of nuclear research was " not negotiable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is known for his fiery speeches " those who have nuclear weapons and have used them in the worst way against people in the world , have no right to prevent nations from achieving peaceful nuclear energy , " the ultra-conservative president told a cheering audience in the religious epicentre of qom . this sparked alarmed reactions from france and germany , which are trying with britain to wean iran off its nuclear ambitions by offering economic and security incentives . a point of no return ? both berlin and paris warned that iran 's decision to resume atomic fuel research despite western opposition could endanger the next round of talks on its controversial nuclear program with three eu nations , due to begin again in austria on jan .
18 . " we view the latest announcement from iran that it will restart its research and development work with concern , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference on wednesday . the resumption of enrichment would be regarded by the west as a point of no return , triggering the implementation of a resolution referring iran to the un security council for violating the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the europeans and the united states are backing a compromise offer from moscow to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil , thus giving iran access to the nuclear fuel cycle while ensuring its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . iranian officials have criticized the proposal but not ruled it out entirely , and are scheduled to discuss it with russian officials on saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu opposes iranian move on nuclear research iran has said it will resume its nuclear research activities next week , despite western opposition .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

under his country 's eu presidency , austrian finance minister martin bartenstein welcomed the agreement and took credit for the eu 's role in drawing moscow and kiev back to the negotiating table . " both sides were called upon by us to refrain from unilateral action , " bartenstein said .
" in addition it was underlined that the european union and member states count on the reasonable compromise solution based on negotiations .
both sides were urged to achieve this goal rapidly in the interests of energy security both in the region and in the european union at large .
our appeal , ladies and gentlemen , was apparently successful . " but europe 's energy chief andris piebalgs said the gas dispute between russia and the ukraine underscores the need to reassess europe 's energy needs .
member states need a common rule book for energy efficiency and renewable and nuclear energy since europe is increasingly dependent on outside sources , he said .
europe needs cohesive policy " europe needs a clear and more collective and cohesive policy on security and energy supply , " piebalgs said .
" today the issue of security of energy supply is only really considered at a national member-state level , but in reality we need a much greater european-wide approach on this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piebalgs , from latvia , says the eu needs a cohesive policy on energy europe relies on russian gas to varying degrees ; germany , for instance , gets a third of its gas from russia .
after moscow cut off kiev 's gas , some eu countries reported a 50 percent loss to their supply . even though russia has reasserted itself as a reliable source , there are other sources of supply the eu could look to , said piebalgs . " for security of supply , if the crisis arose , we have security of stocks at different levels in different member states , " he said .
" there are gas storages that could be used and there also alternative supplies to the european union , we have a lot of gas from norway .
we are also receiving from algeria . " moving towards a common energy policy will now be at the top of the agenda for the austrian presidency , which took the eu 's helm on jan .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?
" the criminal police is carrying out a full investigation and gathering relevant information they can , " said the region ’ s police chief , hubertus andrä . " two people , who were previously still in shock , are now in the position to be questioned in the investigation .
they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .
der tagesspiegel newspaper cited meteorologists on wednesday as saying there must have been about 180 tons of snow on the roof when it gave way . a case of negligence ? the events leading up to the collapse of the roof remained unclear on wednesday . the coach of a local ice hockey club , thomas rumpeltes , has said he was told the snow was to have been cleared from the roof shortly before it caved in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue efforts were often interrupted by bad weather rumpeltes said he had cancelled practice at the rink for a youth team because the authorities had told him of the impending clearance shortly before the accident .
he said no one had warned of any risk of the roof being unstable and that the snow removal was only a precautionary measure . the town 's mayor , wolfgang heitmeier , has rejected accusations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open , saying the roof had been examined hours before it collapsed and the amount of snow on it was within safety limits .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems and said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . reactions to the accident bavaria 's regional interior ministry on wednesday rejected calls for safety certificates for buildings .
it said the cause of the accident needed to be determined before measures could be taken . the tragedy occurred on monday shortly before the rink was due to close for the day . grieving residents are calling for those responsible to be identified and punished and messages of condolence are flooding into the town 's web site . pope benedict xvi , who was born in the state of bavaria , where the accident happened , sent a telegram to the archbishop of munich on wednesday to convey his condolences .
he said his thoughts were with relatives " after this tragic accident which cost the lives mostly of children , " and wished the injured a speedy recovery . according to local radio , a memorial service will be held tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for causes of ice rink disaster rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?
" the criminal police is carrying out a full investigation and gathering relevant information they can , " said the region ’ s police chief , hubertus andrä . " two people , who were previously still in shock , are now in the position to be questioned in the investigation .
they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .
der tagesspiegel newspaper cited meteorologists on wednesday as saying there must have been about 180 tons of snow on the roof when it gave way . a case of negligence ? the events leading up to the collapse of the roof remained unclear on wednesday . the coach of a local ice hockey club , thomas rumpeltes , has said he was told the snow was to have been cleared from the roof shortly before it caved in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue efforts were often interrupted by bad weather rumpeltes said he had cancelled practice at the rink for a youth team because the authorities had told him of the impending clearance shortly before the accident .
he said no one had warned of any risk of the roof being unstable and that the snow removal was only a precautionary measure . the town 's mayor , wolfgang heitmeier , has rejected accusations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open , saying the roof had been examined hours before it collapsed and the amount of snow on it was within safety limits .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems and said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . reactions to the accident bavaria 's regional interior ministry on wednesday rejected calls for safety certificates for buildings .
it said the cause of the accident needed to be determined before measures could be taken . the tragedy occurred on monday shortly before the rink was due to close for the day . grieving residents are calling for those responsible to be identified and punished and messages of condolence are flooding into the town 's web site . pope benedict xvi , who was born in the state of bavaria , where the accident happened , sent a telegram to the archbishop of munich on wednesday to convey his condolences .
he said his thoughts were with relatives " after this tragic accident which cost the lives mostly of children , " and wished the injured a speedy recovery . according to local radio , a memorial service will be held tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for causes of ice rink disaster rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2006 russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the dispute has tarnished russia 's reputation russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say . the deal reached by negotiators on wednesday was hailed by both sides after gazprom 's decision to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine prompted a drop in supplies of up to 40 percent in some european countries that receive russian gas transported through ukraine . the accord allowed russia to claim it would receive the full amount it had demanded for its gas - an almost five-fold increase to $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- about $ 6.50 dollars per cubic foot -rrb- .
but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...
relations with western leaders are more important than anything for putin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkmenistan 's president might not accept the deal turkmenistan is unlikely to accept the low prices envisaged by the deal in the long run , he said .
" a quick estimate without having all the figures means that ukraine can only be paying about $ 30 to turkmenistan to make that arithmetic work .
i do n't think that 's sustainable . "
political analyst petro burkovski , of the school of political studies in kiev , was also critical of the agreement .
" ukraine has resolved one problem only to find itself faced by another one , " burkovski said .
the devil is in the detail of the accord and particularly the role to be played by the rosukrenergo company that will handle the payments , he said . the firm , based in switzerland and owned by gazprom and austria 's raiffeisen bank , has previously handled turkmen gas supplies to ukraine .
dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .
the agreement " creates a potential danger for ukraine , whose imports will now all be managed by the same structure controlled de facto by the russians , " burkovski said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2006 chinese cars pick up speed in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's automobiles are making their way to germany 's autobahns even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory . the cars from chinese manufactures geely , jiangling and brilliance that germans saw at last year 's frankfurt iaa auto exhibition - some of which will be popping up again next week at the detroit auto show - ca n't match their german competitors for now , but it wo n't be long until they do , according to ferdinand dudenhöffer of germany 's center for automotive research . " the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ? " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de automakers eye the new competitor : china the chinese " dragon " is coming to europe , one of the new affordable cars made in china by manufacturers who honed their skills working for western carmakers .
but analysts see no immediate threat from this new competitor .
-lrb- sept .
14 , 2005 -rrb- automotive wind of change from china for years , europe has spoken of china 's importance as the future market for almost everything .
now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ?
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- chinese cars to hit european market in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market .
-lrb- july 8 , 2005 -rrb- feedback are german carmakers being taken advantage of for taking part in joint ventures with chinese companies or is access to the chinese market worth it ?

but with the mixing in of a large amount of cheap gas from central asia , kiev will pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters - a significant hike but easier for the ukrainian government to defend ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in march . " the ukrainian economy is completely ready for new market conditions , " president viktor yushchenko said of the accord on wednesday . russia had cut supplies to ukraine in order to exact vengeance for the so-called orange revolution in 2004 , when kiev broke from moscow and set a new pro-western course envisaging membership of the european union and nato , the head of the panorama research center , vladimir pribylovsky , said .
but the western criticism that resulted from the energy cut , coming as russia takes over the chair of the g8 industrialized nations group , had forced a rethink by the kremlin , he said .
russia reconsiders " the question for russia was n't the price of gas but its desire to take vengeance and to mock yushchenko , " he said .
" at the same time russia had to deliver to europe ...

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not yet clear whether the deal is actually good for yushchenko 's ukraine the damage to russia 's reputation caused by cutting gas supplies in the middle of winter can only speed up europe 's search for alternative energy sources , be they " green " fuels or gas from iran , said viktor kremenyuk , a professor at the russian academy of sciences ' usa and canadian studies center . gazprom holds nearly a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , with nearly twice those of iran , and is the single largest exporter of gas to europe . " both have won something , both have lost something , " kremenyuk said .
" i would bet yushchenko is in a much better position ...
yushchenko has achieved what he wanted .
he has demonstrated to the ukrainian people that russia is ruthless and at the same time he can withstand russian pressure . "
is it really good for ukraine ?
how well the deal will work in practice remains to be seen . gazprom has often had fraught relations with the ex-soviet central asian countries from which it gets the extra supplies that will be crucial to wednesday 's deal , particularly with turkmenistan 's president saparmurat niyazov .
in addition , the financial side of the agreement can not necessarily be taken at face value , said graham weale , a london-based analyst with global insight . the agreement " may be a way for russia to save face and , on a headline basis , achieve what it 's looking for , but it 's possible that … the deal is not all that it seems to be and it 's possible that gazprom is subsidizing the deal , " weale said .

dubious business by uniting control over turkmenistan 's and russia 's exports to ukraine in the hands of one company , ukraine effectively loses leverage , burkovski said .

" the chinese will be competitors sometime around 2010 , " he said .
" however , they do need a certain amount of time until they have cars that are marketable in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adac called the landwind 's performance " catastrophic " this point was proved by recent crash tests conducted on jiangling 's landwind sport-utility vehicle by the adac , germany 's largest automobile association . the club said a driver would have virtually no chance of surviving a head-on crash at 64 km / hour -lrb- 40 mph -rrb- .
the vehicle preformed better in a similar test by tüv , another german certification board , after a series of changes were made . germany , europe provide technical assistance to help the chinese meet stricter western safety and environmental standards , european and american manufacturers partner with chinese companies in exchange for access to china 's domestic market . while the western companies are wary of losing their competitive edge to their partners , the deals are the only way the beijing government allows non-chinese car manufacturers to reach the 160 million chinese expected to buy a car by 2020 . " the chinese automobile manufacturers are using joint ventures to learn how to build cars from germans and europeans , " dudenhöffer said .
" with this knowledge , the chinese are moving aggressively into export markets . " like japan and south korea but faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geely was one of the chinese manufactures at frankfurt 's auto show while smaller manufacturers like geely and jiangling , with a combined total annual production of just 155,000 cars , try to make names for themselves at international auto shows , china 's export market is still in the teething stages - with just 2 percent of the 2.3 million cars china produces leaving the country , according to kpmg 's annual china automotive report . " the chinese will not be a threat in the first years , but they will be a serious additional provider in the market , " said thomas böhm of the german association of motor vehicle importers . but dudenhöffer said he does n't think it will be long until china 's two largest carmakers , shanghai automotive industry -lrb- saic -rrb- , which produces 740,000 cars , and first automotive works -lrb- faw -rrb- , with production of 650,000 cars , get involved . " the big players are more reserved , they are building up their strengths , and we can expect that in three to five years they will begin their attacks on the usa and europe , " he said . for an idea of what could be in store down the line , carmakers only have to look towards japan and south korea . after initially writing off the japanese and korean competition as cheap alternatives that would not meet the demands of the german market , mercedes and co. watched their market share drop as toyota 's and hyundai 's reputation improved . " the chinese have more automobile manufacturers , the manufacturers learn much faster , " said dudenhöffer , comparing the asian nations .
" they are going to grow very quickly . " europe wo n't give up mass market production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw partners with both saic and faw to produce cars in china to fight the emerging competition , german companies wo n't willingly give up any segment of the automobile market , as advocated by chinese officials suggesting europe concentrate on luxury vehicles and leave the cheaper , mass produced cars to china , according to böhm . " the europeans would not be happy with splitting the market in the long run , " he said .
" that is one reason why german manufacturers are moving to china to lower prices . " although german drivers can get very emotional when it comes to buying a car and often remain devoted to their chosen brand , cost could start dictating that chinese cars end up on german driveways . " we have a very high emotional connection to automobiles in germany , but we will not be able to afford it forever , " böhm said , adding that germany 's difficult economic situation is forcing people to examine spending habits .
" if i buy a german car made with relatively high number of parts from china , why not just get a completely chinese product - if the price is right ?

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .
the election campaign was opened this week . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .

loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

" the european union and the united states fear iran 's civil nuclear program is a cover for developing a nuclear bomb .
tehran denies the accusation , insisting the program is designed solely to meet its electricity needs . iaea director mohamed el baradei called earlier this week for " clarifications " on the letter , saying it was essential that iran refrain from " all activities linked to uranium enrichment . " " senior technical people are coming from iran who would presumably help us sort this out , " el baradei said . a meeting initially planned for wednesday was postponed , but a senior iaea official confirmed thursday that talks were underway . explanations needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's uranim conversion facility in isfahan reprocesses uranium ore concentrate " there are meetings planned over the next couple of days , focused on clarifying the letter and in particular what the resumption of -lrb- research and development -rrb- means , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . the iaea wants to know whether tehran is seeking to remove seals the un atomic watchdog has placed on iranian nuclear facilities . in august 2005 , the iaea supervised the removal by iran of the un seal from its isfahan plant , thus enabling it to resume conversion of uranium into gas . this is a first step in the process of making enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civilian reactors as well as the explosive core in nuclear bombs . belligerent rhetoric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated thursday that his country would not retreat from it nuclear program , echoing a statement by ali larijani , iran 's top official for nuclear issues , on wednesday that resumption of nuclear research was " not negotiable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is known for his fiery speeches " those who have nuclear weapons and have used them in the worst way against people in the world , have no right to prevent nations from achieving peaceful nuclear energy , " the ultra-conservative president told a cheering audience in the religious epicentre of qom . this sparked alarmed reactions from france and germany , which are trying with britain to wean iran off its nuclear ambitions by offering economic and security incentives . a point of no return ? both berlin and paris warned that iran 's decision to resume atomic fuel research despite western opposition could endanger the next round of talks on its controversial nuclear program with three eu nations , due to begin again in austria on jan .

" we view the latest announcement from iran that it will restart its research and development work with concern , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press conference on wednesday . the resumption of enrichment would be regarded by the west as a point of no return , triggering the implementation of a resolution referring iran to the un security council for violating the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . the europeans and the united states are backing a compromise offer from moscow to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil , thus giving iran access to the nuclear fuel cycle while ensuring its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . iranian officials have criticized the proposal but not ruled it out entirely , and are scheduled to discuss it with russian officials on saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu opposes iranian move on nuclear research iran has said it will resume its nuclear research activities next week , despite western opposition .

the other three victims were women aged around 40 . thirty-four people were also hurt when the roof collapsed .
thirteen of them remained in hospital but their lives were not in danger , german radio said . a police investigation the ruins of the ice rink are now being carefully cleared with specialized diggers .
but the process is slow , as each chunk of rubble must be collected and numbered as part of an investigation into the cause of the collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was snow to blame ?
" the criminal police is carrying out a full investigation and gathering relevant information they can , " said the region ’ s police chief , hubertus andrä . " two people , who were previously still in shock , are now in the position to be questioned in the investigation .
they will be interviewed in the course of the day , " andrä said . it was not immediately clear what caused the flat roof of the building to cave in , in a region where heavy snowfall is commonplace .
der tagesspiegel newspaper cited meteorologists on wednesday as saying there must have been about 180 tons of snow on the roof when it gave way . a case of negligence ? the events leading up to the collapse of the roof remained unclear on wednesday . the coach of a local ice hockey club , thomas rumpeltes , has said he was told the snow was to have been cleared from the roof shortly before it caved in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue efforts were often interrupted by bad weather rumpeltes said he had cancelled practice at the rink for a youth team because the authorities had told him of the impending clearance shortly before the accident .
he said no one had warned of any risk of the roof being unstable and that the snow removal was only a precautionary measure . the town 's mayor , wolfgang heitmeier , has rejected accusations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open , saying the roof had been examined hours before it collapsed and the amount of snow on it was within safety limits .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems and said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . reactions to the accident bavaria 's regional interior ministry on wednesday rejected calls for safety certificates for buildings .
it said the cause of the accident needed to be determined before measures could be taken . the tragedy occurred on monday shortly before the rink was due to close for the day . grieving residents are calling for those responsible to be identified and punished and messages of condolence are flooding into the town 's web site . pope benedict xvi , who was born in the state of bavaria , where the accident happened , sent a telegram to the archbishop of munich on wednesday to convey his condolences .
he said his thoughts were with relatives " after this tragic accident which cost the lives mostly of children , " and wished the injured a speedy recovery . according to local radio , a memorial service will be held tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for causes of ice rink disaster rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

the eu and the united states are demanding that iran continue to suspend all enrichment-related activities . france has called on iran to reverse its decision to restart nuclear research after a two-year suspension .
france , along with britain and germany , has led european union negotiations with iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program to ensure it can not be used to produce weapons . " we would like iran to abide by the suspension of all activities related to enrichment and reprocessing , which includes centrifuges and research , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . iran 's decision to resume nuclear fuel research despite western opposition was " not negotiable , " the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said wednesday .
the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency , mohammad saidi , announced the day before that his country would resume nuclear fuel research activities beginning jan .
9 , 2006 . larijani said that " research has its own path , and has nothing to do with the industrial production of fuel . " but this distinction is not accepted by the eu and the united states .
they are demanding that iran continue its suspension of all its enrichment-related activities , whether they have a scientific or industrial objective . search for nature of iran 's nuclear research the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna confirmed iran had informed the agency that it would take up research and development again on what it termed its " peaceful nuclear energy program , " the iaea said in a statement . the secretariat said the iaea is now seeking clarification from iran as to the implications of its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei received the nobel peace prize in 2005 the iaea said its director general , mohamed elbaradei , recalled " the importance placed by the iaea board that iran maintains its suspension of all enrichment-related activities as a key confidence-building measure . " it said elbaradei called on iran " to take the steps the iaea requires to resolve outstanding issues regarding the nature of iran 's nuclear program . " mattei said tehran should respond to the iaea 's concerns . " it is up to the iranians to adopt a constructive attitude and to make the necessary gestures to establish trust , " mattei said .
iran had to show that its nuclear program was for exclusively civilian purposes . iranian nuclear enrichment on russian soil ? mattei repeated france 's support of a russian proposition aimed at breaking a deadlock in the eu-iran negotiations .
moscow has suggested that the controversial uranium enrichment process be carried out in russia instead of in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is helping build the bushehr nuclear power plant in southern iran .
" these russian ideas respond to the worries of the international community in terms of proliferation and , at the same time , give iran the means to develop a pacific nuclear program , " mattei said .
" one of the strong points of the russian proposition in our view is that the enrichment activities would not be taking place on iranian territory . " a delegation from moscow will visit tehran on saturday . however , iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said iran would not consider the offer unless it acknowledged the country 's right to conduct uranium enrichment operations in iran , so far the key sticking point in negotiations with the european union . iran is set to have new talks with eu negotiators on jan .

not anymore .
one state has begun singling out muslims for tougher questioning , sparking an outcry across the country . on jan .
1 , life got tougher for muslim immigrants angling for a german passport in the southern state of baden-württemberg .
in a unique move , the interior ministry of the state has said that potential muslim germans would face a lengthy interrogation , involving answering a catalogue of 30 questions on their political , cultural and social views .
subjects include their opinions on religious freedom , equality of the sexes , homosexuality , freedom of expression , the concept of honor , and forced marriage .
questions range from " do you think a woman should obey her husband and that he can beat her if she is disobedient ? " ; and " would you allow your daughter to participate in sports and swimming classes at school ? " ; to " what do you think of the fact that parents forcibly marry off their children ?
do you think such marriages are compatible with human dignity ? "
" serious or just paying lip service ? "
the ministry has said that germany 's 16 federal states must be permitted to discern whether potential new citizens truly accept the country 's basic law , to which they are required under federal law to sign an oath of allegiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg is singling out muslims for tougher questioning " we need to find out whether the applicant really does seriously mean it when he signs an oath of allegiance to the constitution and accepts it , or whether he 's merely paying lip service to it , " said günter loos , baden-württemberg interior ministry press spokesman , in stuttgart .
" there have been neutral surveys and studies that have shown there are discrepancies between muslim beliefs and our constitution - just think of things like forced marriages , honor killings and the like , " loos said .
" if there is a suspicion that the person who wants to become german does not share our fundamental principles and values , then the new interrogation is meant to find that out , " he added .
loos insisted the new procedure is " not so much a catalogue of questions , " but rather a " guideline " meant to aid officials quizzing the applicant .
" discriminatory and racist " officials will document the responses , which the applicant will eventually have to certify with his or her signature .
those who fail to satisfy the authorites of their readiness to accept the basic law will be refused citizenship .
baden-württemberg has also warned that intentionally fudged answers could lead to german citizenship being revoked years later .
the new measure will only be applied to applicants from 57 islamic countries -lrb- some 60 percent of all immigrants to baden-württemberg in 2004 -rrb- .
other candidates will be subject to the procedure in exceptional cases .
those details of the rule , in particular , have raised hackles among politicians and muslim groups .
faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , said the move was discriminatory and racist .
" every country has the right to examine foreigners ' loyalty to the country 's values and social order with certain questions during the naturalization process , " sen said .
" but if 30 questions are only applied to muslims , as is the case in baden-württemberg , then it amounts to religious ostracism and racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

both parties are bound by a coalition agreement with the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which explicitly instructs the grand coalition government to stick with measures to close all nuclear power plants by 2023 . " the coalition agreement is perfectly clear about this point , " steg said . conservatives stress nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos wants to focus on domestic energy sources earlier this week , germany 's economics minister michael glos -lrb- csu -rrb- , said there needed to be a greater focus on domestic energy sources . " it ’ s increasingly becoming apparent that we have to lay greater emphasis on resources available in germany , " glos said .
" german coal is one pillar and will continue to play a role as a source of energy .
but i also want to draw attention to the fact that we still have a number of nuclear power stations in germany which , unfortunately , are going to be turned off in a few years time just for political reasons . " the previous german coalition government of social democrats and the environmentalist greens had struck a deal with german energy producers in 1999 to gradually phase-out the production of nuclear energy by 2023 . german conservatives have since been pushing to extend the life of germany 's reactors - or to have the accord scrapped altogether . a revival of nuclear energy in europe the conservative line dovetails with a reviving interest in nuclear energy in europe , with several european nations considering the merits of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland is building europe 's first nuclear plant in a decade finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . proponents of nuclear energy argue that it emits almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants and would ensure reliable power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the kyoto protocol on global warming . last year , merkel also stressed that prolonging the lifespan of existing nuclear plants in germany would also help the country to continue to export nuclear technology . social democrats against rolling back phase-out ulrich kelber , deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- says his party will resist any attempts to backtrack on the treaty . " this accord is valid and it makes enormous sense , " kelber said .
" it ’ s almost a ritual that economics minister michael glos raises this issue whenever energy prices go up or future energy supplies are allegedly at stake .
none of these problems will be resolved by promoting nuclear energy and even global uranium deposits will be exhausted in about 20 years or so . " hermann scheer , energy expert of the spd also stressed there was no question of freezing the planned nuclear phase-out . the gas dispute has been a " wake up call , " scheer said .
" the party is over , " he said , adding that the answer only lay in renewable energy . renewable energy and power efficiency kelber urged the government under merkel to continue to promote renewable energies and make additional efforts in saving energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station in munich " in this area , the government can support massive private investment so that by 2020 about one third of german energy needs can be generated through renewable energies , " kelber said .
" on the other hand much can still be done in increasing energy efficiency in power generation and in both the public and private spheres .
so there are many ways to reduce dependency on energy imports . " but not all the conservatives are convinced . " it will be an illusion to believe that renewable energies can ever make a substantial contribution to german energy needs , " education and research minister annette schavan -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . she has urged the social democrats to keep an open mind on the issue of nuclear technology , saying no source of energy should be ruled out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks make up the biggest group of foreigners in germany sen pointed out that among the 2.7 million turks in germany - the biggest group among the country 's 3.5 million muslims - there was a high propensity to apply for german passports .
he added that the new measure would hamper the willingness among foreigners to apply for german citizenship , in turn negatively impacting ongoing efforts towards their integration .
" populist " and " clumsy move " the move has enraged politicians , who have slammed it as " populist , " " questionable " and " hypocritical . "
though some have said they understand concerns about the integration of muslims , they insist the measure instead fosters prejudice and fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some point out that even sections of the german population do n't accept homosexuality doubts have also been raised about whether even sections of the german population would pass some of the questions .
volker beck , a leading green party politician proposed a survey in an interview with daily der tagesspiegel to find out who supported equal treatment for homosexuals .
" the interior minister -lrb- of baden-württemberg -rrb- himself would probably fail the test then , " beck said .
an editorial in the left-leaning daily taz added the state had no right to poke in private matters - such as finding out people 's stance on homosexuality .
some states , including bavaria and lower saxony have distanced themselves from the move , saying they have no plans to introduce anything similar .
even authorities at the immigration office in the baden-württemberg capital of stuttgart have expressed misgivings about the new regulation .
" this is a decision that was taken by the interior ministry alone , we were n't part of it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
" we do think that fundamentally it 's right to conduct a more rigorous check on whether applicants conform to the principles laid down in the basic law , " said storr . " at the same time , it 's important that such a guideline then applies to all and not just to muslims .
it 's an extremely clumsy move . "
legal doubts experts have also raised serious legal doubts about the measure .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and legal expert of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , told dertagesspiegel daily that baden-württemberg was skating on thin ice legally .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the move violated the principle of equality anchored in the constitution and added that revoking citizenship was a complicated issue and could n't be solved the way baden-württemberg envisaged it .
it also remains to be seen whether the move has anything to do with a regional election in baden-württemberg three months from now .

harpist bethan hughes has been employed by velindre cancer centre to play music to people being treated there .
it follows research in america which showed that listening to the harp lowered the heart rate .
a first harp-therapy session at the unit was held on wednesday and the musician took requests from patients .
ms hughes , who is a trained harp-therapist , has worked in hospitals and hospices in the us and is also working with troops from the armed forces who are suffering from post-traumatic stress in order to ease symptoms .
she said : " after doing my degree i trained in america specifically in harp therapy .
it helps the patient 's body relax whilst they 're undergoing the treatments they 're receiving barbara wilson , nurse manager " it ca n't just be used by any harpist , you have to be specifically trained .
" i also worked in cancer hospitals and hospices in america so i know how advanced they are with harp therapy research over there .
it would be nice to use what i 've learnt in wales .
" as an international performer , we are so used to being trained classically but with harp therapy we 're trained in so many aspects - vibration frequency , resonance tones , and the medical and physical side of the strings and vibration levels of the harp .
" it definitely works .
i 'm actually using it with the uk and us troops on the front line and they 're finding that the stress levels and post-traumatic stress levels are lowered . "
staff at velindre are hoping that the sound of the harp playing will have a positive effect on patients .
surveys before and after treatment to monitor how patients respond to the music and whether it reduces stress levels will be carried out as part of the therapy .
barbara wilson , clinical nurse manager at the hospital said : " i think there 's growing evidence out there that it helps relax the patient .
" there 's growing evidence in america that it does decrease the blood pressure and helps oxygenation around the body .
" it helps the patient 's body relax whilst they 're undergoing the treatments they 're receiving , " she added .

the bug not only costs lives - the health service spends thousands of pounds on trying to keep it out of hospitals .
pharmacists at queen 's university in belfast say they have developed a new way of killing mrsa .
it is due to be tried out on patients as early as next year .
for many years antibiotics have been used to kill bacteria , but bugs like mrsa are resistant to antibiotics , so now scientists are turning the clock back .
dr ryan donnelly of queen 's school of pharmacy dr ryan donnelly , of queen 's school of pharmacy , said : " the ability of light to kill bacteria was first discovered about 100 ago , but because of the antibiotic era it was largely forgotten .
" it is only recently with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that this has come to the fore again and many different groups involved in treating the likes of mrsa are trying to use this technology now . "
a new gel is used to put a drug where it is needed .
dr paul mccarron , also of queen 's , said : " i saw my son , niall , who was playing with kiddies ' slime and i was just looking at the way it flowed between his fingers .
dr paul mccarron got inspiration from kiddies ' play slime " i thought it had the correct flow properties , to press into a leg ulcer for example .
in other words , it can be pressed in and it will slowly flow to fill the cavity .
" more importantly , whenever you remove it , it can be removed all in one go . "
the gel deposits a drug into the wound or ulcer and then it is lifted out , leaving behind the drug .
the drug makes mrsa and other bugs sensitive to light - much more so than the human cells , so when a powerful light is shone on the wound , it is the bugs like mrsa that will be killed .
dr donnelly said : " certainly , from the work we have done so far , we would like to think that this technology could be successful in eradicating mrsa from wounds and burns in patients in the clinical situation . "
bbc northern ireland health correspondent dot kirby said tests were due to begin on patients in belfast city hospital in the next 12 to 18 weeks .
" if this technique does work , its cost is likely to be small , " she said .
" the drugs are cheap and the light units are expected to cost around £ 15,000 .
each light unit could serve a whole hospital . "

the bug not only costs lives - the health service spends thousands of pounds on trying to keep it out of hospitals .
pharmacists at queen 's university in belfast say they have developed a new way of killing mrsa .
it is due to be tried out on patients as early as next year .
for many years antibiotics have been used to kill bacteria , but bugs like mrsa are resistant to antibiotics , so now scientists are turning the clock back .
dr ryan donnelly of queen 's school of pharmacy dr ryan donnelly , of queen 's school of pharmacy , said : " the ability of light to kill bacteria was first discovered about 100 ago , but because of the antibiotic era it was largely forgotten .
" it is only recently with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that this has come to the fore again and many different groups involved in treating the likes of mrsa are trying to use this technology now . "
a new gel is used to put a drug where it is needed .
dr paul mccarron , also of queen 's , said : " i saw my son , niall , who was playing with kiddies ' slime and i was just looking at the way it flowed between his fingers .
dr paul mccarron got inspiration from kiddies ' play slime " i thought it had the correct flow properties , to press into a leg ulcer for example .
in other words , it can be pressed in and it will slowly flow to fill the cavity .
" more importantly , whenever you remove it , it can be removed all in one go . "
the gel deposits a drug into the wound or ulcer and then it is lifted out , leaving behind the drug .
the drug makes mrsa and other bugs sensitive to light - much more so than the human cells , so when a powerful light is shone on the wound , it is the bugs like mrsa that will be killed .
dr donnelly said : " certainly , from the work we have done so far , we would like to think that this technology could be successful in eradicating mrsa from wounds and burns in patients in the clinical situation . "
bbc northern ireland health correspondent dot kirby said tests were due to begin on patients in belfast city hospital in the next 12 to 18 weeks .
" if this technique does work , its cost is likely to be small , " she said .
" the drugs are cheap and the light units are expected to cost around £ 15,000 .
each light unit could serve a whole hospital . "

the us has said the arrests call into question the government 's commitment to human rights and democracy .

" do you want the government to use the laws , or do you want us to use violence instead ? "

researchers believe that as well as driving all breast development , the cells may have a key role in cancer .
the australian team transplanted the cells into mice tissue and were able to grow a fully-functioning breast .
writing in nature , they say they also found the key stem cells were more numerous in pre-cancerous tissue .
the research holds out hope on two fronts : the possible development of new cancer therapies , and of new techniques for breast reconstruction .
scientists from the walter and eliza hall institute of medical research in parkville , australia , isolated the stem cells from a structure in female mice called the breast pad .
they transplanted one of the cells into the mammary fat pad of a living female mouse from which all breast tissue had been removed .
the cell divided and eventually gave rise to all the normal types of cell found in the mouse breast to such an extent that the gland produced milk in the normal fashion .
tumour factory under normal circumstances the stem cell would produce healthy tissue .
but it is thought that genetic errors , perhaps combined with external influences , could cause the stem cell or a " daughter " cell to create faulty cells .
although there is no proof the stem cells exist in humans , the team is almost certain they do because of the expansion of breasts during pregnancy and puberty .
the team also said that chemotherapy designed to target tumours may not be able to wipe out any of the defective stem cells in the breast as they divide at a different rate .
a spokesman for the australian-led team said : " chemotherapy works by targeting cells that are dividing rapidly , which is typical behaviour of cancer cells .
wonder drug ?
" but an errant stem-like cell may be more resistant to chemotherapy because it divides more slowly .
" so while chemotherapy can eliminate the bulk of cancer cells , the tumour factory itself - a breast cancer stem cell - may survive months or years later . "
the team believes any wonder-drug that can switch off the faulty stem cells would be the ultimate weapon in the fight against breast cancer .
however , such a weapon is far off , as before such a drug can be made , the exact make-up of genes in normal and rogue cells need to be determined .
a spokeswoman for breast cancer support charity breastcancer care said the research was interesting .
" however it is still at very early stages as it has only been carried out in mice .
" further work needs to be undertaken to determine if the same stem cells exist in humans , as well as a greater understanding of other factors that influence a person 's predisposition to developing breast cancer , " she added .

researchers believe that as well as driving all breast development , the cells may have a key role in cancer .
the australian team transplanted the cells into mice tissue and were able to grow a fully-functioning breast .
writing in nature , they say they also found the key stem cells were more numerous in pre-cancerous tissue .
the research holds out hope on two fronts : the possible development of new cancer therapies , and of new techniques for breast reconstruction .
scientists from the walter and eliza hall institute of medical research in parkville , australia , isolated the stem cells from a structure in female mice called the breast pad .
they transplanted one of the cells into the mammary fat pad of a living female mouse from which all breast tissue had been removed .
the cell divided and eventually gave rise to all the normal types of cell found in the mouse breast to such an extent that the gland produced milk in the normal fashion .
tumour factory under normal circumstances the stem cell would produce healthy tissue .
but it is thought that genetic errors , perhaps combined with external influences , could cause the stem cell or a " daughter " cell to create faulty cells .
although there is no proof the stem cells exist in humans , the team is almost certain they do because of the expansion of breasts during pregnancy and puberty .
the team also said that chemotherapy designed to target tumours may not be able to wipe out any of the defective stem cells in the breast as they divide at a different rate .
a spokesman for the australian-led team said : " chemotherapy works by targeting cells that are dividing rapidly , which is typical behaviour of cancer cells .
wonder drug ?
" but an errant stem-like cell may be more resistant to chemotherapy because it divides more slowly .

writing in the journal nature , the scientists say the phenomenon may be important for understanding the impact of present day climate warming .
recent research suggests north atlantic currents which bring heat to northern europe may be weakening .
the new study , by flavia nunes and richard norris from the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla , california , looked at tiny fossil animals called foraminifera in marine sediments from 14 ocean-floor locations around the world .
analysing the ratios of two isotopes of carbon in the shells of these foraminifera allowed them to determine ocean current patterns at the time the creatures died .
time of change the time in question was an extraordinary epoch in earth history - the palaeocene-eocene thermal maximum -lrb- petm -rrb- , when the global average temperature rose by anything between four and seven celsius in a few thousand years .

ocean changes may cool europe computer models of modern climate suggest that temperature changes could affect ocean currents , and recent research has found indications that it is happening now in the north atlantic .
but the disruption 55 million years ago took in more than a single ocean ; the entire global system appears to have altered course .
before the petm , nunes and norris found , surface waters sank principally in the southern hemisphere , with deep currents then flowing north .
as temperatures rose , this pattern abruptly reversed .
the new north-to-south system endured for 40,000 years , and currents took a further 100,000 to return to their previous polarity .
the reason why temperatures shot up during the petm are unclear ; but carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere appear to have been extremely high , about a thousand times higher than currently .
the suspicion is that some kind of feedback mechanism may have been involved .
one theory is that an initial warming changed the distribution of heat in the oceans so that deposits of gas hydrates on the sea floor were released , with carbon dioxide and methane rising to the surface and entering the atmosphere , causing further greenhouse warming .
the new research provides some support for this theory , as well as demonstrating that abrupt temperature changes can have a long-term impact on ocean currents which are , as the gulf stream demonstrates , intimately tied to weather systems .
some researchers have raised concern that release of gas hydrates could contribute to present-day global warming .

speaking as the consumer electronics show -lrb- ces -rrb- in las vegas opens , mr gates talked about microsoft 's plan to remake itself to match digital lifestyles .
" consumers are getting more connected and software is at the centre of that , " he told an avid tech audience .
some 130,000 people are expected to attend ces to catch up with the latest gadgets and technology trends .
future vision mr gates is a veteran keynote speaker at the annual techfest , which is one of the largest consumer electronics show in the world .
the main theme emerging at the conference is of an online , connected world where consumers can easily control their media , deciding how and when they listen to music , read the news or watch tv .
while this idea has been talked about in the past , many believe technology has matured to a stage where it is becoming reality .
bill gates took on steve ballmer in the virtual boxing ring microsoft 's co-founder and chief software architect sought to wow his captive audience with a scenario of the potential of such a digital future .
this ranged from a flat touchscreen panel in the kitchen showing customised tv reports , traffic updates and the location of family members to a wraparound desktop at work that combined video conferencing , instant messaging and more .
" these are scenarios that people understand if we make them simpler , " he said .
" these things need to work across all the different devices . "
in mr gates ' future , windows will be the backbone that binds different devices and systems .
it marks a shift of focus for microsoft , which has in the past focused on pcs .
music store but the home computer was not ignored .
during the presentation , there were more details about the upgrade to the windows operating system , called vista , due to go sale in the latter half of the year .
mr gates said windows would be behind many different gadgets but the focus was largely on entertainment features such as watching video or listening to music .
there were also details of the deal with mtv to provide an online music store , called urge , which will feature two million tracks .
the service will be integrated into the new windows media player , much like apple 's online store is part of itunes .
" 2006 is going to be a big year for the digital lifestyle , " concluded mr gates .
attendees at ces will have the opportunity to hear different visions of the future in speeches at the conference by the heads of sony , intel , yahoo and google .
the show starts officially on thursday and runs until sunday .

commentators are in sombre mood as they gauge the impact on the political landscape .
they speculate that even should ariel sharon recover , the era of his leadership is over .
sima kadmon in yediot aharonot even if sharon comes out of the condition he is in , the process of his recovery will be very long .
it is difficult to see sharon contesting the upcoming elections at the head of the party he had established -lsb- kadima -rsb- .
from this morning what we have here is a totally different political system .
aluf benn in haaretz the hospitalisation of ariel sharon ... will make it difficult for him to return to his job even if he survives .
moreover , he will have a hard time convincing the public of his ability to serve four more years , after undergoing two strokes in two and a half weeks .
one can cautiously say it appears that the era in which sharon stood at israel 's helm came to a tragic end yesterday .
the race for prime minister , which until yesterday looked like sharon 's one-man show , is now open .
nadav eyal in maariv three big parties are contesting seniority in israel and none of them will remain as it was last night , and will not get the same number of mandates .
kadima will be forced to try to overcome sharon 's absence , at least in the near future , for sharon is kadima and kadima is sharon ...
-lsb- the 2006 election campaign -rsb- has begun with a big national trauma .
nahum barnea in yediot aharonot the gravity of sharon 's condition reshuffles all the political cards .
it postpones the resignation of the likud ministers .
it moderates the general tone in the election campaign .
it is premature to sum up sharon 's public career , his political and military achievements , his contribution to the strengthening and success of israel .
but it is possible to say at this hour that only a few among israel 's leaders had the self-confidence , composure , courage that sharon demonstrated during his two terms of office as prime minister .
amnon dankner in maariv yesterday israel 's citizens held their breath , crossed fingers and prayed for the safety of the prime minister .
they did this regardless of their political views because sharon - for good and for bad - is an important , significant , controversial but always compelling part of our life in this land since the 1950s .
editorial in jerusalem post even if sharon fully recovers from his major stroke , there is no way that he will be able to act as prime minister during the next couple of months , and full-time election campaigning is definitely out of the question .
the question that remains is not what will happen with sharon - we all wish him good health - but he is out of the picture at least for the coming elections that will have to be held on time .
the question is whether kadima has a future without sharon .

commentators are in sombre mood as they gauge the impact on the political landscape .
they speculate that even should ariel sharon recover , the era of his leadership is over .
sima kadmon in yediot aharonot even if sharon comes out of the condition he is in , the process of his recovery will be very long .
it is difficult to see sharon contesting the upcoming elections at the head of the party he had established -lsb- kadima -rsb- .
from this morning what we have here is a totally different political system .
aluf benn in haaretz the hospitalisation of ariel sharon ... will make it difficult for him to return to his job even if he survives .
moreover , he will have a hard time convincing the public of his ability to serve four more years , after undergoing two strokes in two and a half weeks .
one can cautiously say it appears that the era in which sharon stood at israel 's helm came to a tragic end yesterday .
the race for prime minister , which until yesterday looked like sharon 's one-man show , is now open .
nadav eyal in maariv three big parties are contesting seniority in israel and none of them will remain as it was last night , and will not get the same number of mandates .
kadima will be forced to try to overcome sharon 's absence , at least in the near future , for sharon is kadima and kadima is sharon ...
-lsb- the 2006 election campaign -rsb- has begun with a big national trauma .
nahum barnea in yediot aharonot the gravity of sharon 's condition reshuffles all the political cards .
it postpones the resignation of the likud ministers .
it moderates the general tone in the election campaign .
it is premature to sum up sharon 's public career , his political and military achievements , his contribution to the strengthening and success of israel .
but it is possible to say at this hour that only a few among israel 's leaders had the self-confidence , composure , courage that sharon demonstrated during his two terms of office as prime minister .
amnon dankner in maariv yesterday israel 's citizens held their breath , crossed fingers and prayed for the safety of the prime minister .
they did this regardless of their political views because sharon - for good and for bad - is an important , significant , controversial but always compelling part of our life in this land since the 1950s .
editorial in jerusalem post even if sharon fully recovers from his major stroke , there is no way that he will be able to act as prime minister during the next couple of months , and full-time election campaigning is definitely out of the question .
the question that remains is not what will happen with sharon - we all wish him good health - but he is out of the picture at least for the coming elections that will have to be held on time .
the question is whether kadima has a future without sharon .
