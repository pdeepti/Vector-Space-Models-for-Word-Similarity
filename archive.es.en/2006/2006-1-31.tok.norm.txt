but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .

and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so .

some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .
" -lsb- the cities -rsb- all have to reorient themselves , but they have a lot less going for them than wolfsburg .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process .

" this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

he 'll be welcomed as a trusted friend . even before taking office , christian schwarz-schilling managed to accomplish something that happens rarely in bosnia and herzegovina : bosniaks , serbs and croats all agree that he 's the right man for the difficult job of un high representative . on tuesday , the 75-year-old christian democrat will take over as head of the international office of high representative in bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- ohr -rrb- , which employs 500 people .
he has far-reaching powers and already knows how he wants to use them . bildunterschrift : buildings like this hotel in sarajevo may have been restored , but the country 's still far away from normalcy " the first priority will be to do what we can to get the economy going , " he said .
" secondly , the administration , the courts , the parliament have to be normalized in order for bosnia and herzegovina to become a normal state and for the people to have their civil rights .
and thirdly , the road to europe needs to be cleared , both in brussels and in bosnia . " aimi n g to lose his job but schwarz-schilling also wants to slowly liberate the country from the international community 's paternalism .
this means that he wants to make his own job redundant .
but unlike his predecessor , he is not banking on removing disobedient politicians but convincing people instead .
that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .
if they do n't accept these suggestions and oppose them , then we 'll have to use our powers .

schwarz-schilling also wants to increase international efforts in this respect . " it 's a shame and a scandal , but i do n't primarily blame bosnians , " he said .
" i 've always said that the international community has to be willing to do this .
we will do everything , together with the government in bosnia , with the allied troops and with the secret services , to achieve that goal . " germa n y 's n ew role strengthening government institutions to clear the bosnia 's path to europe is another goal for schwarz-schilling .
he knows that a lot remains to be done in the balkan state , but he 's also expecting to see more support from germany . he appreciates the fact that the new german government is willing to share responsibility for the region .
in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .
as mediator , he has managed to reach compromises on all sides .
without any formal powers , he fought against hardliners and helped refugees to return to their homes .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process .

the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .

and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .

that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .

in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 europe agrees on funding as hamas calls threats blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding will continue but will be stopped if hamas does not renounce violence europe , along with the united states and russia , agreed tuesday to continue critical funding to palestinians but warned election victors hamas that its future government must give up violence and recognize israel . hamas leader khaled meshaal , however , derided us and european threats to put financial pressure on his islamist group as being " in vain " , saying they amounted to forcing it to abandon its struggle for freedom . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her partners in the quartet for middle east peace - the united nations , russia and the european union - pledged overnight monday in london to keep money flowing into palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's interim caretaker administration . " we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 bosnia 's staunch german friend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling is glad that germany is getting more involved taking over as high representative in bosnia and herzegovina from britain 's paddy ashdown , christian schwarz-schilling will become the first german in the job .
he 'll be welcomed as a trusted friend . even before taking office , christian schwarz-schilling managed to accomplish something that happens rarely in bosnia and herzegovina : bosniaks , serbs and croats all agree that he 's the right man for the difficult job of un high representative . on tuesday , the 75-year-old christian democrat will take over as head of the international office of high representative in bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- ohr -rrb- , which employs 500 people .
he has far-reaching powers and already knows how he wants to use them . bildunterschrift : buildings like this hotel in sarajevo may have been restored , but the country 's still far away from normalcy " the first priority will be to do what we can to get the economy going , " he said .
" secondly , the administration , the courts , the parliament have to be normalized in order for bosnia and herzegovina to become a normal state and for the people to have their civil rights .
and thirdly , the road to europe needs to be cleared , both in brussels and in bosnia . " aimi n g to lose his job but schwarz-schilling also wants to slowly liberate the country from the international community 's paternalism .
this means that he wants to make his own job redundant .
but unlike his predecessor , he is not banking on removing disobedient politicians but convincing people instead .
that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .
if they do n't accept these suggestions and oppose them , then we 'll have to use our powers .
i have to try to reach the goals that have been set for me by the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite rewards , karadzic and mladic still have n't been arrested one of the main goals that was not reached during the past decade was the arrest of alleged war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic .

he 'll be welcomed as a trusted friend . even before taking office , christian schwarz-schilling managed to accomplish something that happens rarely in bosnia and herzegovina : bosniaks , serbs and croats all agree that he 's the right man for the difficult job of un high representative . on tuesday , the 75-year-old christian democrat will take over as head of the international office of high representative in bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- ohr -rrb- , which employs 500 people .
he has far-reaching powers and already knows how he wants to use them . bildunterschrift : buildings like this hotel in sarajevo may have been restored , but the country 's still far away from normalcy " the first priority will be to do what we can to get the economy going , " he said .
" secondly , the administration , the courts , the parliament have to be normalized in order for bosnia and herzegovina to become a normal state and for the people to have their civil rights .
and thirdly , the road to europe needs to be cleared , both in brussels and in bosnia . " aimi n g to lose his job but schwarz-schilling also wants to slowly liberate the country from the international community 's paternalism .
this means that he wants to make his own job redundant .
but unlike his predecessor , he is not banking on removing disobedient politicians but convincing people instead .
that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .
if they do n't accept these suggestions and oppose them , then we 'll have to use our powers .

schwarz-schilling also wants to increase international efforts in this respect . " it 's a shame and a scandal , but i do n't primarily blame bosnians , " he said .
" i 've always said that the international community has to be willing to do this .
we will do everything , together with the government in bosnia , with the allied troops and with the secret services , to achieve that goal . " germa n y 's n ew role strengthening government institutions to clear the bosnia 's path to europe is another goal for schwarz-schilling .
he knows that a lot remains to be done in the balkan state , but he 's also expecting to see more support from germany . he appreciates the fact that the new german government is willing to share responsibility for the region .
in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .
as mediator , he has managed to reach compromises on all sides .
without any formal powers , he fought against hardliners and helped refugees to return to their homes .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .

and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .

in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad .

" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .

dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .

finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?

he has far-reaching powers and already knows how he wants to use them . bildunterschrift : buildings like this hotel in sarajevo may have been restored , but the country 's still far away from normalcy " the first priority will be to do what we can to get the economy going , " he said .
" secondly , the administration , the courts , the parliament have to be normalized in order for bosnia and herzegovina to become a normal state and for the people to have their civil rights .
and thirdly , the road to europe needs to be cleared , both in brussels and in bosnia . " aimi n g to lose his job but schwarz-schilling also wants to slowly liberate the country from the international community 's paternalism .
this means that he wants to make his own job redundant .
but unlike his predecessor , he is not banking on removing disobedient politicians but convincing people instead .
that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .
if they do n't accept these suggestions and oppose them , then we 'll have to use our powers .
i have to try to reach the goals that have been set for me by the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite rewards , karadzic and mladic still have n't been arrested one of the main goals that was not reached during the past decade was the arrest of alleged war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic .
schwarz-schilling also wants to increase international efforts in this respect . " it 's a shame and a scandal , but i do n't primarily blame bosnians , " he said .
" i 've always said that the international community has to be willing to do this .
we will do everything , together with the government in bosnia , with the allied troops and with the secret services , to achieve that goal . " germa n y 's n ew role strengthening government institutions to clear the bosnia 's path to europe is another goal for schwarz-schilling .
he knows that a lot remains to be done in the balkan state , but he 's also expecting to see more support from germany . he appreciates the fact that the new german government is willing to share responsibility for the region .
in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .
as mediator , he has managed to reach compromises on all sides .
without any formal powers , he fought against hardliners and helped refugees to return to their homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2006 facing a changing industry , a city tries to reinvent itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg is embracing change out of necessity wolfsburg is a planned city established around a volkswagen plant in 1938 and has thrived for decades .
but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .

" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

" this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .
the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states . below , a sample of opinion from countries that have spoken out on the eu constitution 's future . austria as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , austria leads the constitutional revival camp .
austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .
the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states . below , a sample of opinion from countries that have spoken out on the eu constitution 's future . austria as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , austria leads the constitutional revival camp .
austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 reviving the eu constitution ... or not großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way forward for the embattled constitution ?
as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .
the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states . below , a sample of opinion from countries that have spoken out on the eu constitution 's future . austria as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , austria leads the constitutional revival camp .
austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?
austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ?

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .
the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states . below , a sample of opinion from countries that have spoken out on the eu constitution 's future . austria as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , austria leads the constitutional revival camp .
austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2006 facing a changing industry , a city tries to reinvent itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg is embracing change out of necessity wolfsburg is a planned city established around a volkswagen plant in 1938 and has thrived for decades .
but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .
" -lsb- the cities -rsb- all have to reorient themselves , but they have a lot less going for them than wolfsburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2006 facing a changing industry , a city tries to reinvent itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg is embracing change out of necessity wolfsburg is a planned city established around a volkswagen plant in 1938 and has thrived for decades .
but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .
" -lsb- the cities -rsb- all have to reorient themselves , but they have a lot less going for them than wolfsburg .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says hamas must change to win its support hamas must change and renounce violence if it wants europe 's support , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday as eu foreign ministers met to discuss the militant group 's shock election win .

" the subject is under discussion , " a us diplomat in kabul told afp .
" but it is clear that we would like the ' afghan burden ' to be shared , notably at the multilateral level . " military help n eeded on the military side , there has already been some headway with nato countries to boost their force in the insurgency-hit country by about 6,000 extra soldiers in the coming months . britain announced last week it will send 3,300 troops as part of a major new three-year mission to bring nato peacekeepers to southern afghanistan , without waiting for european allies who have so far failed to commit . the troops will take over from the us-dominated coalition in the south and east , the most unstable parts of the country , allowing washington to pare its deployment by about more than 2,000 as announced in december by defense secretary donald rumsfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " no one can afford to see a destabilized afghanistan , " un chief kofi annan warned after a brief , unscheduled meeting with prime minister peter balkenende of the netherlands , which is hesitating over whether to send more troops there . karzai wa n ts to ma n age aid during a visit sunday to denmark , afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan would need international aid for 5 years , 10 years or even longer if it is to bolster its security and rebuild its institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai with danish premier anders fogh rasmussen on sunday karzai also called for more money to be put directly into the hands of the afghan government . apart from being the biggest contributor to the military operation , the united states also made up two thirds of the reconstruction aid sent to the country in 2005 . while the international community , for which afghanistan is far from the only priority , would want to make the country self-sufficient as soon as possible , it is clear the road ahead will be a long one . lo n g road ahead ravaged by 25 years of war , the fledgling democracy has few of its own resources to rely on . bildunterschrift : factories like this one that produces raisins ca n't contribute much to afghanistan 's budget last year only seven percent of the afghan budget was financed by the government through about $ 330 million in domestic revenues , generated for the most part through tariffs .
about 90 percent of the rest came from international donors , notably the united states . the " afghanistan compact " to be signed in london by the country 's 70 donor nations and aid groups sets the target of raising the domestic budgetary revenue to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2010-11 , compared to the current 4.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan policemen the united states , which directs two thirds of its aid to afghanistan towards security , is meanwhile also funding nearly the entire cost of rebuilding the afghan police and army . this is also likely to be a long-term endeavor , with an official with nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- estimating a desertion rate of 30 percent . katri n a , iraq , deficit o n us ' mi n d " in the discussions we have today , the americans systematically try to push security expenditure into the general budget , which is financed by several countries , " a european official told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the also have to take care of the aftermath of hurricane katrina " it should not be forgotten that we have -lrb- hurricane -rrb- katrina , iraq and a worrying deficit , " a us diplomat who asked not to be named told afp . the united states said on jan .
27 it would announce a big financial aid package for afghanistan at the conference . but a european official said : " in the end , their assistance is more likely to drop from 2006 onwards . " meeting with karzai in london monday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said monday that washington remains committed to helping afghanistan . " it is true that there are some adjustments being made as the requirements change in different parts of the country but the united states will continue to fight the counterterrorism threat wherever we find it , " she said .

where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .

austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .

dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .

" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .

the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so .

it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .
" -lsb- the cities -rsb- all have to reorient themselves , but they have a lot less going for them than wolfsburg .

angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .
but at least one controversial designer seems to think there 's still room for improvement . germans have fallen in love with their new chancellor , giving her popularity ratings that have been unheard of for decades .
the fact that she 's smiling more -lrb- or that she 's photographed more often while smiling -rrb- probably plays quite an important role in the country 's new-found affection for its new leader . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first came some make-up , the hair followed later but angela merkel 's transformation from a stern taskmistress with an obvious disdain for make-up , blow-driers and fashion to coiffed couture connoisseur began way before she set up shop at willy-brandt-str .
1 -lrb- that 's the chancellery for those of you not that familiar with berlin -rrb- . long before her election as german head of government , merkel stopped air-drying her sensible hair cut , laid on mascara and turned to fashion designers for help .
it 's a price female politicians seem to have to pay on their way to the top , as proven by a certain us senator from new york . looki n g i n flue n tial but while the chancellor seems to have found the right balance between putting on a show and staying true to herself , the former e nfan t terrible of british fashion seems to think that there 's still room for improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has already made cool new friends on the international stage , but will she start wearing westwood ?
" if mrs. merkel wants to wear -lrb- vivienne -rrb- westwood , i can promise that i will design clothes for her that will make her look chic , refined and influential , " the 65-year-old designer , who once designed high heels in the shape of male genitals , recently told ster n magazine . as one of the most powerful people in the world , merkel might not be too concerned about looki n g influential , because she , err , is as influential as they come . but despite the fact that dame vivienne has toned down quite a bit since boasting about not wearing underwear when seeing the queen , merkel 's unlikely to become westwood 's customer . or will she ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de copy-condi 's german couture us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .

-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years .

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .

austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .

germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .

austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .

" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .

but at least one controversial designer seems to think there 's still room for improvement . germans have fallen in love with their new chancellor , giving her popularity ratings that have been unheard of for decades .
the fact that she 's smiling more -lrb- or that she 's photographed more often while smiling -rrb- probably plays quite an important role in the country 's new-found affection for its new leader . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first came some make-up , the hair followed later but angela merkel 's transformation from a stern taskmistress with an obvious disdain for make-up , blow-driers and fashion to coiffed couture connoisseur began way before she set up shop at willy-brandt-str .
1 -lrb- that 's the chancellery for those of you not that familiar with berlin -rrb- . long before her election as german head of government , merkel stopped air-drying her sensible hair cut , laid on mascara and turned to fashion designers for help .
it 's a price female politicians seem to have to pay on their way to the top , as proven by a certain us senator from new york . looki n g i n flue n tial but while the chancellor seems to have found the right balance between putting on a show and staying true to herself , the former e nfan t terrible of british fashion seems to think that there 's still room for improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has already made cool new friends on the international stage , but will she start wearing westwood ?
" if mrs. merkel wants to wear -lrb- vivienne -rrb- westwood , i can promise that i will design clothes for her that will make her look chic , refined and influential , " the 65-year-old designer , who once designed high heels in the shape of male genitals , recently told ster n magazine . as one of the most powerful people in the world , merkel might not be too concerned about looki n g influential , because she , err , is as influential as they come . but despite the fact that dame vivienne has toned down quite a bit since boasting about not wearing underwear when seeing the queen , merkel 's unlikely to become westwood 's customer . or will she ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de copy-condi 's german couture us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization .

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .
the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states . below , a sample of opinion from countries that have spoken out on the eu constitution 's future . austria as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , austria leads the constitutional revival camp .
austrian leader wolfgang schüssel said recently that " the constitution is not dead , it is in the middle of a ratification process . " finland there are doubts about how much support the " yea " camp can expect from finland .
finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .
chirac has said he could envision improving the functioning of the eu institutions , starting from the framework of the existing treaties . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel are at odds over the treaty germany and france , which normally strive to cooperate on eu issues , are at odds when it comes to the constitution .
germany would like to save the constitution in its entirety , and chancellor angela merkel has said that constitutional " cherry-picking " does not work .
chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .
and the european reality is a reality of states , mostly national states . " portugal portugal will take up the challenge of reviving the constitution during its presidency in the second half of 2007 , portuguese prime minister jose socrates has said .
" the project of the constitutional treaty was signed by the 25 member states and it would not be right -lrb- to forget it -rrb- , " socrates told his national parliament . slovenia supports camp of member states in favour of reviving the constitution .
" in slovenia , we are convinced that the eu constitution is very much alive , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel was quoted as saying in the austrian newspaper der standard . spain spain would like to save the constitution in its entirety .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos said his government would find it impossible to explain changes in the text of the document to the spanish people , as they already approved it by a large majority in the referendum last year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ?
austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ?

but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 europe agrees on funding as hamas calls threats blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding will continue but will be stopped if hamas does not renounce violence europe , along with the united states and russia , agreed tuesday to continue critical funding to palestinians but warned election victors hamas that its future government must give up violence and recognize israel . hamas leader khaled meshaal , however , derided us and european threats to put financial pressure on his islamist group as being " in vain " , saying they amounted to forcing it to abandon its struggle for freedom . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her partners in the quartet for middle east peace - the united nations , russia and the european union - pledged overnight monday in london to keep money flowing into palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's interim caretaker administration . " we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says hamas must change to win its support hamas must change and renounce violence if it wants europe 's support , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday as eu foreign ministers met to discuss the militant group 's shock election win .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .

the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so .

he 'll be welcomed as a trusted friend . even before taking office , christian schwarz-schilling managed to accomplish something that happens rarely in bosnia and herzegovina : bosniaks , serbs and croats all agree that he 's the right man for the difficult job of un high representative . on tuesday , the 75-year-old christian democrat will take over as head of the international office of high representative in bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- ohr -rrb- , which employs 500 people .
he has far-reaching powers and already knows how he wants to use them . bildunterschrift : buildings like this hotel in sarajevo may have been restored , but the country 's still far away from normalcy " the first priority will be to do what we can to get the economy going , " he said .
" secondly , the administration , the courts , the parliament have to be normalized in order for bosnia and herzegovina to become a normal state and for the people to have their civil rights .
and thirdly , the road to europe needs to be cleared , both in brussels and in bosnia . " aimi n g to lose his job but schwarz-schilling also wants to slowly liberate the country from the international community 's paternalism .
this means that he wants to make his own job redundant .
but unlike his predecessor , he is not banking on removing disobedient politicians but convincing people instead .
that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .

schwarz-schilling also wants to increase international efforts in this respect . " it 's a shame and a scandal , but i do n't primarily blame bosnians , " he said .
" i 've always said that the international community has to be willing to do this .
we will do everything , together with the government in bosnia , with the allied troops and with the secret services , to achieve that goal . " germa n y 's n ew role strengthening government institutions to clear the bosnia 's path to europe is another goal for schwarz-schilling .
he knows that a lot remains to be done in the balkan state , but he 's also expecting to see more support from germany . he appreciates the fact that the new german government is willing to share responsibility for the region .
in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .
as mediator , he has managed to reach compromises on all sides .
without any formal powers , he fought against hardliners and helped refugees to return to their homes .

that does n't mean that he 's unwilling to take harsh measures , however . " we 're not an occupying power , but we 're here to help people and make it clear to politicians how certain goals can be reached , " he said .
" if they manage to reach them on their own , we 'll be there as advisors .
if not , we 'll make suggestions .
if they do n't accept these suggestions and oppose them , then we 'll have to use our powers .
i have to try to reach the goals that have been set for me by the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite rewards , karadzic and mladic still have n't been arrested one of the main goals that was not reached during the past decade was the arrest of alleged war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic .
schwarz-schilling also wants to increase international efforts in this respect . " it 's a shame and a scandal , but i do n't primarily blame bosnians , " he said .
" i 've always said that the international community has to be willing to do this .
we will do everything , together with the government in bosnia , with the allied troops and with the secret services , to achieve that goal . " germa n y 's n ew role strengthening government institutions to clear the bosnia 's path to europe is another goal for schwarz-schilling .
he knows that a lot remains to be done in the balkan state , but he 's also expecting to see more support from germany . he appreciates the fact that the new german government is willing to share responsibility for the region .
in 1992 , he resigned from his post as german postal services minister because he could not accept germany 's policy of non-interference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in bosnia " i 'm glad that germany is taking on responsibility - both militarily and politically , " he said . schwarz-schilling sees himself as a staunch friend of bosnia .
as mediator , he has managed to reach compromises on all sides .
without any formal powers , he fought against hardliners and helped refugees to return to their homes .

" a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .

despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization .

" the subject is under discussion , " a us diplomat in kabul told afp .
" but it is clear that we would like the ' afghan burden ' to be shared , notably at the multilateral level . " military help n eeded on the military side , there has already been some headway with nato countries to boost their force in the insurgency-hit country by about 6,000 extra soldiers in the coming months . britain announced last week it will send 3,300 troops as part of a major new three-year mission to bring nato peacekeepers to southern afghanistan , without waiting for european allies who have so far failed to commit . the troops will take over from the us-dominated coalition in the south and east , the most unstable parts of the country , allowing washington to pare its deployment by about more than 2,000 as announced in december by defense secretary donald rumsfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " no one can afford to see a destabilized afghanistan , " un chief kofi annan warned after a brief , unscheduled meeting with prime minister peter balkenende of the netherlands , which is hesitating over whether to send more troops there . karzai wa n ts to ma n age aid during a visit sunday to denmark , afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan would need international aid for 5 years , 10 years or even longer if it is to bolster its security and rebuild its institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai with danish premier anders fogh rasmussen on sunday karzai also called for more money to be put directly into the hands of the afghan government . apart from being the biggest contributor to the military operation , the united states also made up two thirds of the reconstruction aid sent to the country in 2005 . while the international community , for which afghanistan is far from the only priority , would want to make the country self-sufficient as soon as possible , it is clear the road ahead will be a long one . lo n g road ahead ravaged by 25 years of war , the fledgling democracy has few of its own resources to rely on . bildunterschrift : factories like this one that produces raisins ca n't contribute much to afghanistan 's budget last year only seven percent of the afghan budget was financed by the government through about $ 330 million in domestic revenues , generated for the most part through tariffs .
about 90 percent of the rest came from international donors , notably the united states . the " afghanistan compact " to be signed in london by the country 's 70 donor nations and aid groups sets the target of raising the domestic budgetary revenue to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2010-11 , compared to the current 4.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan policemen the united states , which directs two thirds of its aid to afghanistan towards security , is meanwhile also funding nearly the entire cost of rebuilding the afghan police and army . this is also likely to be a long-term endeavor , with an official with nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- estimating a desertion rate of 30 percent . katri n a , iraq , deficit o n us ' mi n d " in the discussions we have today , the americans systematically try to push security expenditure into the general budget , which is financed by several countries , " a european official told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the also have to take care of the aftermath of hurricane katrina " it should not be forgotten that we have -lrb- hurricane -rrb- katrina , iraq and a worrying deficit , " a us diplomat who asked not to be named told afp . the united states said on jan .
27 it would announce a big financial aid package for afghanistan at the conference . but a european official said : " in the end , their assistance is more likely to drop from 2006 onwards . " meeting with karzai in london monday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said monday that washington remains committed to helping afghanistan . " it is true that there are some adjustments being made as the requirements change in different parts of the country but the united states will continue to fight the counterterrorism threat wherever we find it , " she said . " we made the mistake once before of leaving afghanistan and not only did afghans pay for it , americans paid for it on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.01.2006 facing a changing industry , a city tries to reinvent itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg is embracing change out of necessity wolfsburg is a planned city established around a volkswagen plant in 1938 and has thrived for decades .
but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so . " not unique wolfsburg is not the only city facing a decline of its traditional industrial base , although it is one of the few german cities having some success with creating new sources of revenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranes dismantle the winding tower of an old coal mine in the ruhr region the heavily industrial ruhr region faces with a bleak future as more and more of its unprofitable factories and mines shut down and legions of workers with few transferable skills lose their jobs .
some cities in the region are trying the wolfsburg strategy , like essen , which is applying to become a european cultural capital in 2010 , but it 's an uphill battle . " there is really nothing that can compensate for the massive deindustrialization in this region , " said markus .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .
schnellecke wants the city to become a destination for tourists , not just for automotive parts destined for new vw golfs and jettas . " wolfsburg was founded almost 70 years ago because of a certain economic situation in germany , " he said .
" now we 're experiencing a second foundation and a new phase of development in our city . " in 1994 , a new art museum opened in the city .
in 2000 , a gleaming new vw autostadt , or " auto city " opened its doors .
sort of a high-tech amusement park centered around the car , it has attracted more than 12 million visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the phaeno science center has attracted global attention for its groundbreaking architecture in december 2002 , a new stadium opened its gates , the volkswagen arena , where the local soccer team plays .
and in november , the phaeno science center was inaugurated .
the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .
wolfsburg 's unemployment rate is around 11 percent , at the national average , but is up several points from two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there might be fewer production lines in wolfsburg soon " we 're in a bit of a critical situation with vw now , " said schnellecke .
" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .
" the new things get a lot of attention and bring people to the city , but keeping the vw factory successful during this structural change is just as important , if not more so .

" the subject is under discussion , " a us diplomat in kabul told afp .
" but it is clear that we would like the ' afghan burden ' to be shared , notably at the multilateral level . " military help n eeded on the military side , there has already been some headway with nato countries to boost their force in the insurgency-hit country by about 6,000 extra soldiers in the coming months . britain announced last week it will send 3,300 troops as part of a major new three-year mission to bring nato peacekeepers to southern afghanistan , without waiting for european allies who have so far failed to commit . the troops will take over from the us-dominated coalition in the south and east , the most unstable parts of the country , allowing washington to pare its deployment by about more than 2,000 as announced in december by defense secretary donald rumsfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " no one can afford to see a destabilized afghanistan , " un chief kofi annan warned after a brief , unscheduled meeting with prime minister peter balkenende of the netherlands , which is hesitating over whether to send more troops there . karzai wa n ts to ma n age aid during a visit sunday to denmark , afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan would need international aid for 5 years , 10 years or even longer if it is to bolster its security and rebuild its institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai with danish premier anders fogh rasmussen on sunday karzai also called for more money to be put directly into the hands of the afghan government . apart from being the biggest contributor to the military operation , the united states also made up two thirds of the reconstruction aid sent to the country in 2005 . while the international community , for which afghanistan is far from the only priority , would want to make the country self-sufficient as soon as possible , it is clear the road ahead will be a long one . lo n g road ahead ravaged by 25 years of war , the fledgling democracy has few of its own resources to rely on . bildunterschrift : factories like this one that produces raisins ca n't contribute much to afghanistan 's budget last year only seven percent of the afghan budget was financed by the government through about $ 330 million in domestic revenues , generated for the most part through tariffs .
about 90 percent of the rest came from international donors , notably the united states . the " afghanistan compact " to be signed in london by the country 's 70 donor nations and aid groups sets the target of raising the domestic budgetary revenue to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2010-11 , compared to the current 4.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan policemen the united states , which directs two thirds of its aid to afghanistan towards security , is meanwhile also funding nearly the entire cost of rebuilding the afghan police and army . this is also likely to be a long-term endeavor , with an official with nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- estimating a desertion rate of 30 percent . katri n a , iraq , deficit o n us ' mi n d " in the discussions we have today , the americans systematically try to push security expenditure into the general budget , which is financed by several countries , " a european official told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the also have to take care of the aftermath of hurricane katrina " it should not be forgotten that we have -lrb- hurricane -rrb- katrina , iraq and a worrying deficit , " a us diplomat who asked not to be named told afp . the united states said on jan .

" it is true that there are some adjustments being made as the requirements change in different parts of the country but the united states will continue to fight the counterterrorism threat wherever we find it , " she said .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization .

angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .
but at least one controversial designer seems to think there 's still room for improvement . germans have fallen in love with their new chancellor , giving her popularity ratings that have been unheard of for decades .
the fact that she 's smiling more -lrb- or that she 's photographed more often while smiling -rrb- probably plays quite an important role in the country 's new-found affection for its new leader . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first came some make-up , the hair followed later but angela merkel 's transformation from a stern taskmistress with an obvious disdain for make-up , blow-driers and fashion to coiffed couture connoisseur began way before she set up shop at willy-brandt-str .
1 -lrb- that 's the chancellery for those of you not that familiar with berlin -rrb- . long before her election as german head of government , merkel stopped air-drying her sensible hair cut , laid on mascara and turned to fashion designers for help .
it 's a price female politicians seem to have to pay on their way to the top , as proven by a certain us senator from new york . looki n g i n flue n tial but while the chancellor seems to have found the right balance between putting on a show and staying true to herself , the former e nfan t terrible of british fashion seems to think that there 's still room for improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has already made cool new friends on the international stage , but will she start wearing westwood ?
" if mrs. merkel wants to wear -lrb- vivienne -rrb- westwood , i can promise that i will design clothes for her that will make her look chic , refined and influential , " the 65-year-old designer , who once designed high heels in the shape of male genitals , recently told ster n magazine . as one of the most powerful people in the world , merkel might not be too concerned about looki n g influential , because she , err , is as influential as they come . but despite the fact that dame vivienne has toned down quite a bit since boasting about not wearing underwear when seeing the queen , merkel 's unlikely to become westwood 's customer . or will she ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de copy-condi 's german couture us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .

" we do believe that abu mazen needs to be supported , " said rice , using abbas 's nom de guerre , ensuring that funds will be available to pay for palestinian police officers and civil servants . but the quartet warned that the palestinians ' critical lifeline of foreign aid could be cut off unless hamas - perpetrator of deadly suicide bomb attacks on israelis - abandons violence , recognizes israel and embraces the diplomatic " road map " to peace . that blueprint to peace envisions an independent palestinian nation existing side by side with the jewish state . the eu has given about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million dollars -rrb- annually to the palestinians since 2003 , but the decisive win by hamas has left the bloc in a quandary because the group figures on both us and eu terrorist blacklists . in a statement the quartet said it believed " that the palestinian people have the right to expect that a new government will address their aspirations for peace and statehood . " conditions to aid focus on the end of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election victory brought violent scenes to the streets of gaza as fatah and hamas supporters clashed .
but the statement stressed that " future assistance to any future government would be reviewed by donors against the government 's commitment to the principles of non-violence , recognition of israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the road map . " with three months likely to pass before a new palestinian government is formed , the quartet 's stance amounts to a watch period for hamas to change its stripes if it wants to be accepted as a serious partner in the peace process . the islamist movement swiftly rejected the quartet 's demands .
" the conditions posed by the quartet constitute pressure which serves the interests of israel and not the palestinian people , " hamas mp and spokesman mosheer al-masri told afp . al-masri added that if the international aid continued to flow " the next -lrb- hamas -rrb- government will ensure that it is used according to the law and not allow corruption . democracy won in palestinian elections , says hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas political leader khaled meshaal accused the west of failing in democracy .
in an opinion piece in the british daily the guardian newspaper published tuesday , hamas supreme leader meshaal said the west was punishing the palestinian people for resisting oppression and striving for justice by taking such a hard line . " the day hamas won the palestinian democratic elections the world 's leading democracies failed the test of democracy , " meshaal wrote .
the west is missing a chance to open a " new chapter " in its relations with the palestinians , arabs and muslims , he added . " our message to the us and eu governments is this : your attempt to force us to give up our principles or our struggle is in vain . " a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , appealed earlier monday in gaza city to the quartet to meet the radical islamist organization for " a dialogue without preliminary conditions and in a spirit of neutrality . " pressed on how long the european union - a major contributor to palestinian coffers - would be prepared to give hamas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said : " i think that it will depend how long it takes in time for the formation of the government . " he referred to estimates of three months .
" that is the time in which they have to clarify all these things .
if we have not got any sign that they move in that direction it will be very difficult , " solana said . putin sees refusal of aid as a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin approved the continuation of aid and called a halt would be a mistake .
despite agreeing with the quartet in london , russian president vladimir putin took a slightly different stance later on tuesday .
speaking from moscow putin said that russia did not share the west 's official view that hamas was a " terrorist " organization but added that this did not mean the movement could expect moscow 's unqualified support . " hamas must leave its radical declarations , must recognize israel 's right to exist and normalize contact with the international community , " putin said .
he described the movement 's unexpected recent election victory as a " serious blow " to us efforts to broker a middle east peace settlement . hamas must make the transition from being a radical opposition movement to the governing party of the palestinian people , putin said , adding however that the fact of hamas ' coming to power in the palestinian territories was not sufficient grounds for cutting off aid to the palestinians . " refusal of aid to the palestinian people would be a mistake in any event , " he said , adding : " our foreign ministry has never described hamas as a terrorist organization .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little .

" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

" the subject is under discussion , " a us diplomat in kabul told afp .
" but it is clear that we would like the ' afghan burden ' to be shared , notably at the multilateral level . " military help n eeded on the military side , there has already been some headway with nato countries to boost their force in the insurgency-hit country by about 6,000 extra soldiers in the coming months . britain announced last week it will send 3,300 troops as part of a major new three-year mission to bring nato peacekeepers to southern afghanistan , without waiting for european allies who have so far failed to commit . the troops will take over from the us-dominated coalition in the south and east , the most unstable parts of the country , allowing washington to pare its deployment by about more than 2,000 as announced in december by defense secretary donald rumsfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " no one can afford to see a destabilized afghanistan , " un chief kofi annan warned after a brief , unscheduled meeting with prime minister peter balkenende of the netherlands , which is hesitating over whether to send more troops there . karzai wa n ts to ma n age aid during a visit sunday to denmark , afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan would need international aid for 5 years , 10 years or even longer if it is to bolster its security and rebuild its institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai with danish premier anders fogh rasmussen on sunday karzai also called for more money to be put directly into the hands of the afghan government . apart from being the biggest contributor to the military operation , the united states also made up two thirds of the reconstruction aid sent to the country in 2005 . while the international community , for which afghanistan is far from the only priority , would want to make the country self-sufficient as soon as possible , it is clear the road ahead will be a long one . lo n g road ahead ravaged by 25 years of war , the fledgling democracy has few of its own resources to rely on . bildunterschrift : factories like this one that produces raisins ca n't contribute much to afghanistan 's budget last year only seven percent of the afghan budget was financed by the government through about $ 330 million in domestic revenues , generated for the most part through tariffs .
about 90 percent of the rest came from international donors , notably the united states . the " afghanistan compact " to be signed in london by the country 's 70 donor nations and aid groups sets the target of raising the domestic budgetary revenue to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2010-11 , compared to the current 4.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan policemen the united states , which directs two thirds of its aid to afghanistan towards security , is meanwhile also funding nearly the entire cost of rebuilding the afghan police and army . this is also likely to be a long-term endeavor , with an official with nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- estimating a desertion rate of 30 percent . katri n a , iraq , deficit o n us ' mi n d " in the discussions we have today , the americans systematically try to push security expenditure into the general budget , which is financed by several countries , " a european official told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the also have to take care of the aftermath of hurricane katrina " it should not be forgotten that we have -lrb- hurricane -rrb- katrina , iraq and a worrying deficit , " a us diplomat who asked not to be named told afp . the united states said on jan .

" it is true that there are some adjustments being made as the requirements change in different parts of the country but the united states will continue to fight the counterterrorism threat wherever we find it , " she said .

" military help n eeded on the military side , there has already been some headway with nato countries to boost their force in the insurgency-hit country by about 6,000 extra soldiers in the coming months . britain announced last week it will send 3,300 troops as part of a major new three-year mission to bring nato peacekeepers to southern afghanistan , without waiting for european allies who have so far failed to commit . the troops will take over from the us-dominated coalition in the south and east , the most unstable parts of the country , allowing washington to pare its deployment by about more than 2,000 as announced in december by defense secretary donald rumsfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " no one can afford to see a destabilized afghanistan , " un chief kofi annan warned after a brief , unscheduled meeting with prime minister peter balkenende of the netherlands , which is hesitating over whether to send more troops there . karzai wa n ts to ma n age aid during a visit sunday to denmark , afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan would need international aid for 5 years , 10 years or even longer if it is to bolster its security and rebuild its institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai with danish premier anders fogh rasmussen on sunday karzai also called for more money to be put directly into the hands of the afghan government . apart from being the biggest contributor to the military operation , the united states also made up two thirds of the reconstruction aid sent to the country in 2005 . while the international community , for which afghanistan is far from the only priority , would want to make the country self-sufficient as soon as possible , it is clear the road ahead will be a long one . lo n g road ahead ravaged by 25 years of war , the fledgling democracy has few of its own resources to rely on . bildunterschrift : factories like this one that produces raisins ca n't contribute much to afghanistan 's budget last year only seven percent of the afghan budget was financed by the government through about $ 330 million in domestic revenues , generated for the most part through tariffs .
about 90 percent of the rest came from international donors , notably the united states . the " afghanistan compact " to be signed in london by the country 's 70 donor nations and aid groups sets the target of raising the domestic budgetary revenue to 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2010-11 , compared to the current 4.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan policemen the united states , which directs two thirds of its aid to afghanistan towards security , is meanwhile also funding nearly the entire cost of rebuilding the afghan police and army . this is also likely to be a long-term endeavor , with an official with nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- estimating a desertion rate of 30 percent . katri n a , iraq , deficit o n us ' mi n d " in the discussions we have today , the americans systematically try to push security expenditure into the general budget , which is financed by several countries , " a european official told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the also have to take care of the aftermath of hurricane katrina " it should not be forgotten that we have -lrb- hurricane -rrb- katrina , iraq and a worrying deficit , " a us diplomat who asked not to be named told afp . the united states said on jan .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .
but at least one controversial designer seems to think there 's still room for improvement . germans have fallen in love with their new chancellor , giving her popularity ratings that have been unheard of for decades .
the fact that she 's smiling more -lrb- or that she 's photographed more often while smiling -rrb- probably plays quite an important role in the country 's new-found affection for its new leader . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first came some make-up , the hair followed later but angela merkel 's transformation from a stern taskmistress with an obvious disdain for make-up , blow-driers and fashion to coiffed couture connoisseur began way before she set up shop at willy-brandt-str .
1 -lrb- that 's the chancellery for those of you not that familiar with berlin -rrb- . long before her election as german head of government , merkel stopped air-drying her sensible hair cut , laid on mascara and turned to fashion designers for help .
it 's a price female politicians seem to have to pay on their way to the top , as proven by a certain us senator from new york . looki n g i n flue n tial but while the chancellor seems to have found the right balance between putting on a show and staying true to herself , the former e nfan t terrible of british fashion seems to think that there 's still room for improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has already made cool new friends on the international stage , but will she start wearing westwood ?
" if mrs. merkel wants to wear -lrb- vivienne -rrb- westwood , i can promise that i will design clothes for her that will make her look chic , refined and influential , " the 65-year-old designer , who once designed high heels in the shape of male genitals , recently told ster n magazine . as one of the most powerful people in the world , merkel might not be too concerned about looki n g influential , because she , err , is as influential as they come . but despite the fact that dame vivienne has toned down quite a bit since boasting about not wearing underwear when seeing the queen , merkel 's unlikely to become westwood 's customer . or will she ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de copy-condi 's german couture us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .
but a suit she recently wore had already appeared on the world stage before .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years .
-lrb- july 4 , 2005 -rrb- stylists battle to claim merkel makeover in an astonishing transformation , cdu leader angela merkel went from dowdy schoolmarm to polished powerfrau in a matter of months .
but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story .
-lrb- sept .

as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .
where do various member states stand on the document 's future ? the european constitution was put on ice after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the draft document last year .
but at the invitation of the austrian government , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , a group of eu politicians , artists and intellectuals recently met in salzburg to discuss the way forward for the stalled project .
throughout the bloc , there are discordant views on what should be done about the constitution .
so far , 12 countries - austria , cyprus , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia , slovenia , and spain - have ratified the treaty .
germany has voted in favour of the constitution , but the federal president has not yet signed the ratification .

finnish president tarja halonen had expressed surprise at austria 's initiative to revive discussion , saying " to us , the recess declared after the referendums in france and holland is still valid . "
however , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen has expressed support for the project and hopes that countries that already ratified the constitution will be flexible when it comes to changing the text .
" we have to be realistic and show flexibility in this question , " vanhanen said at the meeting in salzburg . france not giving up on the aims of the constitution , french president jacques chirac has proposed a " pick and choose " approach to the constitutional text , which would see only single elements of the constitution ratified .

chirac 's approach would " seriously damage the overall balance , " merkel said .
she has proposed attaching a declaration on the " social dimension of europe " in a bid to save the charter as a whole . netherlands the dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that the constitution is " dead " for the netherlands , adding that it is out of the question that his country would ever ratify it .
dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the constitution last june , following a french " no " vote three days earlier .
however dutch supporters of the constitution point out that , technically , their country 's refusal to ratify the treaty only applies to the current cabinet period , which ends with parliamentary elections due in may 2007 . poland polish president lech kaczynski has said that the eu should draft a brand new constitution , as the one on the table pushes for more integration than eu citizens are willing to accept .
shortly before the meeting in austria , he told a polish news agency that any new document should " reflect the eu 's real needs .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 31.01.2006 iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high over the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power tehran 's nuclear negotiator said referring iran to the un security council would spell the end of diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear program - after the permanent council members agreed to do so . " we consider any referral or report of iran to the security council as the end of diplomacy , " ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , was quoted as saying by state television . previously , foreign ministers from six countries - permanent security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany - said in a joint statement after a four-hour dinner in london that they had agreed that the un nuclear watchdog " should report to the security council its decision on the steps required of iran " when the international atomic energy agency meets in vienna thursday .
but in a compromise with russian reluctance , the powers put off un action until at least march . a senior us state department official hailed the move as an historic breakthrough as it was the " first time in two years that you have all the members of the permanent five -lrb- who have veto powers on the council -rrb- giving the same message to iran . " this means that iran " ca n't depend on russia and china to block action " at the security council , which can impose sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but europe and the united states believe it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons . the tense dinner hosted by british foreign secretary jack straw on monday spilled over past midnight as the west worked on convincing key iranian ally and trade partner russia , which has resisted taking iran to the security council , as well as china to join in sending a strong signal to iran . russia won a key concession ; however , as the statement said the major powers agreed that the security council " should await the -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general 's report to the march meeting of the iaea board ... before deciding to take action to reinforce the authority of the iaea process . " the security council can issue warnings or impose sanctions as punitive measures in its role as an enforcement body , unlike the iaea which has no such powers and has been investigating the iranian nuclear program for three years . the united states had wanted immediate security council action but the official said the us realized that in diplomacy " you give a little and take a little . " " the action is transferred to new york , " the us official said , about the iranian dossier going to the security council .
" in diplomacy you take it one step at a time .
the real issue was getting to the security council , " the official said . the statement said the iaea " should also report to the security council all iaea reports and resolutions as adopted , " which include findings of non-compliance with international safeguards that clear the way to un action . the official said us secretary of state condoleezza rice had gone into the dinner with her five counterparts feeling " that iran had to be referred to the un security council , that temporizing had gone on too long . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he and his colleagues " wished that a firm message from the international community be sent in a united fashion to the iranian authorities , who must understand that they must suspend nuclear activities . " " the diplomatic route , which is the better way to proceed , can then resume , " douste-blazy told a late-night meeting with french reporters . another western official told the press : " now the ball is really in iran 's court . " an angry iranian reaction cutting off cooperation or pushing ahead with nuclear fuel work could guarantee un action while iranian compliance with iaea demands to cease such work which makes reactor fuel but also bomb material and to cooperate with iaea inspectors could defuse the situation . rice had said earlier that iran 's response to diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise was not good enough and that it was playing for time . last september the iaea found tehran in non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for hiding nuclear work for almost two decades and called on it to suspend all nuclear fuel activities . but while a finding of non-compliance requires referral of the matter to the security council , the iaea board of governors put off such a report to give iran time to comply with its demands . iran then set off the latest crisis on january 10 when it broke iaea seals on uranium enrichment equipment . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .
in 1991 , it opened production in eastern europe and today employs more than 41,000 there .
according to the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , by 2010 , more than 50 percent of german auto parts will be produced abroad . " germany as a production facility for cars is losing its importance , " said car 's report . taking action early on , wolfsburg city officials saw the writing on the wall and realized that they had to do something . " it 's becoming harder and harder to have industrial jobs in germany , " said wolf schnellecke , wolfsburg 's mayor .
" because of this industrial change , we need to create new jobs .
that 's what we are trying to do . " he and other city officials hope to wean wolfsburg from its strong dependence on the automaker by diversifying its economy .
in 1998 , the city began its drive to enact structural changes in wolfsburg to compensate for the rapid changes in the automotive sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's stadium is one of the city 's new attractions the plan calls for wolfsburg to become a center for entertainment , tourism , sports and leisure .

the building , designed by star architect zaha hadid , has helped put the city on the global architectural map .
officials hope the center will see 180,000 visitors pass through its doors annually . according to schnellecke , the strategy is working , since more than 20,000 jobs have been created thanks to the city 's diversification drive .
it helps that wolfsburg is in the center of germany , and only one hour by fast train from berlin .
and while vw is hurting , it 's still a global auto giant with money to invest in its headquarters city . rough road still ahead schnellecke admits wolfsburg is not out of the woods yet .
around 50 percent of the population still works in some capacity for volkswagen , which in september announced job cuts of up to 14,000 at its european factories .

" it proves that we were right in trying to get on new paths economically . " markus hesse , who teaches city and regional planning at the free university in berlin , agrees that diversification is essential , and that wolfsburg was right to begin the process early on .
but he says the ability of stadiums , museums and entertainment centers to provide a balance to the economic heft of vw is limited . " they can not compensate for the main industrial product of the city , vw cars , " he said .

but as more car manufacturing leaves germany , the city is trying to wean itself from its dependence on the auto . wolfsburg is literally the town that vw built .
its origins go back to an industrial colony created to house workers at a new volkswagen production facility .
it was christened with the unwieldy name of " city of the strength through joy car , " the original name of the auto that would later be known as the volkswagen beetle . " strength through joy " was the name of the national socialist leisure organization . although after world war two the town carried the stigma of its nazi founders and lay largely in rubble , once the vw conveyor belts began turning again , the town , now renamed wolfsburg after a 14th-century castle there , began to thrive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for decades , vw brought prosperity to wolfsburg residents that happy state of affairs lasted for decades .
wages were good , attracting workers from across germany to this artificial town on the plains between berlin and hanover .
they got discounts on cars , job security and annual raises .
the cozy relationship between vw management , workers ' representatives and the state government meant labor unease was almost unheard of . end of an era but those days are over .
in the early 1990s , at a time when vw was selling more cars than ever , the company experienced an economic crisis that threatened its existence , and in turn , the fate of the city of wolfsburg . " we can only pray " was a comment in the newsmagazine der spiegel at the end of 1992 as it revealed that volkswagen had suffered enormous losses in operative results .
vw 's debt had jumped to dangerous levels and manufacturing costs had gone through the roof .
the bad news was made even worse soon after by a recession that took hold of germany in 1993 . by this time , the berlin wall had fallen , and car manufacturers , including vw , were realizing that production could be done more cheaply in eastern europe than it could in high-wage germany .

figures for 2005 show 56,916 londoners failed to buy a licence - more than one tenth of the total number caught across the country .
the worst boroughs were newham -lrb- 4,249 -rrb- , brent -lrb- 3,714 -rrb- , haringey -lrb- 3,296 -rrb- , greenwich -lrb- 3,152 -rrb- and lambeth -lrb- 3,100 -rrb- .
the current fee is £ 126.50 but that will rise to £ 131.50 from 1 april .
a spokesman for tv licensing said it was " sending a clear warning to londoners who think they can get away without paying for a tv licence - they ca n't " .
pet excuses she said evasion was at a record low at 5 % .
many blame their pets in outlandish attempts to avoid punishment - from the dog eating the document to it being lost when used to line a snake 's cage .
among those to evade paying their licence fee last year was premiership footballer el-hadji diouf who was fined £ 100 by magistrates .
the 25-year-old bolton wanderers player had refused to let the tv licence officer into his liverpool home , but confirmed he had a colour television and no licence .
earlier this month the government revealed that the total television licence fee revenue collected by the bbc between 2000 and 2005 was more than £ 13bn .

denmark cartoons row as the controversy over the publication of a series of caricatures of the prophet muhammad in a leading danish daily threatens to escalate into an international trade row , the country 's papers voice serious concerns about the possible trade and security repercussions .
the cartoons , which were published in jyllands - posten last september and subsequently reprinted in norway , have sparked a wave of anger across islamic countries , threats by islamic groups and calls for a boycott of danish goods .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen on monday raised the issue with the european commission which said it could seek action at the world trade organization .
jyllands - posten has apologised for offending muslims but defended its right to freedom of expression .
the daily warns that " the situation demands serious consideration by the eu because crucial principles are at stake if the situation is not tackled sensibly " .
" democracy and freedom of expression are basic foundations of the concept of the eu partnership " , it says .
" the eu therefore has special obligations when a member country gets into problems for taking these principles seriously . "
the episode has now escalated beyond all reason berlingske tidende in view of berlingske tidende , " the episode has now escalated beyond all reason " and " the political , economic and diplomatic consequences for denmark have reached a level where it is justified to talk of an outright national disaster " .
the paper believes the prime minister was right to dissociate himself personally from the cartoons in a tv interview .
it describes the cartoons as an " unnecessary provocation " and explains " not because the newspaper was not entitled ... but on the basic principle that the right to expression does not imply a duty to offend others " .
" this is a complicated affair , not a simple battle of values between islam and danish democracy .
and that is how it should be reacted to by denmark , the eu and possibly the world trade organization . "
the affair is a disaster for denmark 's reputation , danish exports and security politiken politiken sums up the affair as " a disaster for denmark 's reputation , danish exports and danes ' security " .
" the drawings of the prophet have turned into an episode that is out of control .
perhaps even for arab governments , which normally have a firm grip on both their media and their populations " .
" no matter what denmark does now , it is far from certain that the situation will calm down , " it warns .
it argues that the blame lies squarely with the government .
the norwegian government " had no difficulties " in disassociating itself from a newspaper which reprinted the controversial cartoons , while the danish premier refused to meet concerned ambassadors back in october , it points out .
" the truth is that in this case our otherwise so professional prime minister has acted with an arrogance which has already seriously damaged the country . "
outside denmark , the row prompts russia 's novyye izvestiya to ask : " what is the most expensive work of contemporary graphic art in denmark ?
" a series of 12 caricatures of the prophet muhammad .
they have cost the country 's budget at least half a billion dollars . "
" the publication of the cartoons has turned denmark into a ' collective salman rushdie ' , " it says .
eu hamas dilemma other european papers ponder the dilemma facing the eu in dealing with hamas following its victory in last week 's palestinian elections .
" europe spells out its conditions to hamas , " is the headline on the front page of france 's le figaro , which reports that a few hours before the meeting of the quartet in london yesterday , eu foreign ministers set out their conditions for the continuation of their financial support to the palestinian authority .
" the europeans , who are the main contributor to the palestinian budget , urged the islamist movement to renounce violence , recognise israel and give up its weapons , " it reports .
for france 's liberation , " refusing to participate indirectly in the destruction of israel " by funding the policy of hamas " is an undisputable requirement of democratic diplomacy " .
yet pushing hamas " towards a radical policy and into the arms of ahmadinejad -lrb- the iranian president -rrb- may durably jeopardise appeasement in the middle east " , it argues .
" the attacks carried out by hamas on israeli civilians are not the main reason why the group was elected , " the paper says , adding that many of its members and supporters are in favour of a " truce " and " quasi-peaceful coexistence with israel " .
" hamas will have to be judged on its actions rather than its words , " it says .
merkel in middle east in germany , there is no shortage of praise chancellor merkel 's assertive performance during her recent visit to the middle east .
" angela merkel has handled her latest trip skilfully , too , " says the berliner zeitung , noting that she named three conditions for continued financial aid from the west - recognition of israel , the renunciation of violence and the continuation of the peace process .
her tone in talks with palestinian leader mahmoud abbas was " not unfriendly , but nevertheless firm " , the paper says , adding that she was right not to meet hamas representatives .
a european carrot would strengthen the pragmatic and moderate wing of hamas , while the stick would only encourage the radicals die tageszeitung " that hamas must - and wants to - now assume tangible responsibility could constitute a basis for peace and it certainly puts the political process on a firmer , more realistic foundation , " the paper says .
but this is still only a hope and it was therefore " wiser to refrain from declarations of this sort during a flying visit " .
angela merkel has " succeeded admirably " in both recognising the reality of the palestinian elections and appealing for a responsible approach , says die welt .
" as the first european visitor since the elections , she has set standards in dealing with the radical hamas , " it adds .
unlike her predecessor , who avoided israel , mrs merkel , " a foreign policy novice " , is " prepared to play an active role in the region " .
similarly , business paper handelsblatt notes that what had been planned as a routine foreign visit has turned into a test of frau merkel 's mettle , and " as in washington or moscow earlier , she came across as confident and assured " .
and yet , frau merkel was unable to gloss over the dilemma confronting germany and europe , the paper says .
the paper warns of " dramatic consequences " if hamas fails to renounce terrorism and the eu cuts financial aid to the palestinians .
die tageszeitung agrees " it is questionable whether blatantly blackmailing hamas will bring the desired results " .
the organisation is in the " midst of a far-reaching transformation which could culminate in laying down arms and recognition of israel " , the paper says , pointing out that the last attack in israel for which hamas claimed responsibility was in september 2004 .
" a european carrot would strengthen the pragmatic and moderate wing of hamas , while the stick would only encourage the radicals , " it adds .
the west would like to see more democracy in the arab world , but " unfortunately it is mostly the islamists who are successful at the ballot box " , it notes .
" how europe plans to tackle this dilemma will be clear from the way it deals with hamas . "
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

more than 300 companies from the uk , france , germany , israel , russia and the us are taking part .
indian defence minister pranab mukherjee , who opened the four-day event , urged global arms companies to enter joint production with india .
india is one of the world 's leading buyers of conventional arms .
in 2004 it bought $ 5.7bn worth of weapons , ahead of its asian economic rival , china .
leading international companies lockheed martin , boeing , rolls royce and dassault are participating in the delhi defence exposition .
india is also looking to strike deals between the global manufacturers and its domestic defence industry .
" our defence production units have taken to a market-friendly approach and offer an opportunity to bring in global technologies for joint production and export to third countries , " defence minister mukherjee pranab mukherjee is quoted as saying by afp news agency .
major buys delhi is expected to spend more than $ 8bn in defence purchases over the next few years , and is in the market for fighter jets and missile production systems .
india is looking to buy more than 100 advanced combat aircraft to replace its ageing , russian-built fleet .

' far from ideal ' businesses and residents in duranhill will be consulted .
chief constable michael baxter said : " consultation with local residents and businesses is critical .
it is proposed that consultation will be taken as soon as we can , and hopefully they can feel the benefits of a police presence in the area . "
police authority chair reg watson said : " the current custody facilities are far from ideal and it is essential that a long-term solution be found .
" durranhill is in a good location especially being in close proximity to carlisle city centre . "
the temporary planning application at rickergate and the appeal for planning at houghton will continue to be pursued in tandem at least until the durranhill application is resolved .

robots did not charm .
revenge of the sith made me howl with laughter .
the good movies showed up late , just in time for oscar .
good night , and good luck is my pick for best picture , but brokeback mountain will win .
i 'd like to see the constant gardener nominated , but it 's probably too politically sensitive for the academy to get the prize .
walk the line will pop up in this category too .
meet the panel name : megan mcleod age : 28 lives : ottawa , ontario , canada occupation : non-profit admin / popcorn monkey favourite all-time film : too many to list but singin ' in the rain and brazil are right up there click here to return to the oscar panel main page philip seymour hoffman 's turn as truman capote was brilliant , but i 'm rooting for david strathairn , who may have been channelling edward r murrow from beyond the grave in good night , and good luck .
with one puff on a cigarette , he could convey dozens of thoughts and emotions .
heath ledger will earn a nod and i hope that cillian murphy sneaks in for his work in breakfast on pluto .
charlize theron really wants another oscar , but north country is n't the vehicle .
i think this award will go to felicity huffman , and i hope she is nominated , even though transamerica has yet to open in this neck of the woods .
rachel weisz might not be campaigning for lead actress , but i hope she is .
finally , for best director , i imagine ang lee will win the big prize , but i hope to see george clooney -lrb- i can hardly believe it either ! -rrb- and fernando meirelles in the competition .
both good night , and good luck and the constant gardener are filmed with such care that their directors need to be recognized with a nomination . "

meet the panel name : megan mcleod age : 28 lives : ottawa , ontario , canada occupation : non-profit admin / popcorn monkey favourite all-time film : too many to list but singin ' in the rain and brazil are right up there click here to return to the oscar panel main page philip seymour hoffman 's turn as truman capote was brilliant , but i 'm rooting for david strathairn , who may have been channelling edward r murrow from beyond the grave in good night , and good luck .
with one puff on a cigarette , he could convey dozens of thoughts and emotions .
heath ledger will earn a nod and i hope that cillian murphy sneaks in for his work in breakfast on pluto .
charlize theron really wants another oscar , but north country is n't the vehicle .
i think this award will go to felicity huffman , and i hope she is nominated , even though transamerica has yet to open in this neck of the woods .
rachel weisz might not be campaigning for lead actress , but i hope she is .
finally , for best director , i imagine ang lee will win the big prize , but i hope to see george clooney -lrb- i can hardly believe it either ! -rrb- and fernando meirelles in the competition .
both good night , and good luck and the constant gardener are filmed with such care that their directors need to be recognized with a nomination .

i think so ...
blockbuster / event movies did less well and thought provoking indie films have made a great resurgence .
political and personal stories -lrb- and actors , not stars -rrb- seem to be back on the agenda .
hollywood may be realising that film is an art form and that there are audiences for " grown-up " topics .
it should n't be all about the takings .
well , we can but hope .

it has won everything so far and i do n't see the academy bucking the trend .
i 'd also like to see good night , and good luck , crash , walk the line and jarhead go up for it , but reckon the latter will miss out to capote .
syriana and munich are outsiders .
director - i 've always enjoyed clooney 's style behind the camera , but reckon he 'll be beaten by ang lee .
paul haggis -lrb- crash -rrb- , bennett miller -lrb- capote -rrb- will be there and steven spielberg -lrb- munich -rrb- may edge out fernando merilles -lrb- the constant gardener -rrb- and sam mendes -lrb- jarhead -rrb- .
actor - i think philip seymour hoffman is amazing and would be very surprised if he or heath ledger do n't scoop it .
david strathairn -lrb- good night , and good luck -rrb- and joaquin phoenix -lrb- walk the line -rrb- will be there , but there could be a surprise nomination - i 'd like to see jake gyllenhall get some recognition for his turn in jarhead .
actress - i think reese witherspoon may get this based on her career rise , but felicity huffman is becoming a hot tip .
oscar likes it when women " play ugly " .

some of the smaller independent movies i particularly enjoyed , ones like broken flowers with bill murray , deserve a mention .
what a great performance from murray .

my biggest disappointment by far was spielberg 's war of the worlds , great effects but sadly lacking in any sort of heart or soul , you just did n't really care about the characters .
that 's the problem spielberg always has , we expect him to come up with a miracle , and miracles are in such short supply .
