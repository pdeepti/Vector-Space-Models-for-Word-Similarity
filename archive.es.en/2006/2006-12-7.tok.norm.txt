the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .

modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .

the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy . " given the ability of iran and syria to influence events within iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in iraq , the united states should try to engage them constructively , " said the report , among other key recommendations . germany could play mediator 's role karsten voigt , the german foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation , told the berliner zeitung newspaper he sees us dialog with iran and syria as absolutely necessary .
he suggested that germans and europeans could help and mediate in talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt sees germany in the mediator 's role he added that the baker report 's recommendation for a strategy change in iraq and the middle east had met with international support . " we should be happy that there is a course correction in the united states , " voigt said on n-tv television .
" if we as europeans and as germans can help diplomatically , then we should .
we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts . " there will be no military engagement of germany in iraq , also not in the future , " voigt told the nordwest zeitung newspaper on thursday .
" this change of political course was urgently needed .
there must be an organized withdrawal .

the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .

" turkey appears to be cautiously prepared to make a concession . " an eu official , speaking on condition of anonymity , could only partly confirm the information . " it 's about a turkish port in the mediterranean , a unilateral opening without conditions , " he said .
" it is certainly a new development , but it 's too early to say how it will all play out .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy . " given the ability of iran and syria to influence events within iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in iraq , the united states should try to engage them constructively , " said the report , among other key recommendations . germany could play mediator 's role karsten voigt , the german foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation , told the berliner zeitung newspaper he sees us dialog with iran and syria as absolutely necessary .
he suggested that germans and europeans could help and mediate in talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt sees germany in the mediator 's role he added that the baker report 's recommendation for a strategy change in iraq and the middle east had met with international support . " we should be happy that there is a course correction in the united states , " voigt said on n-tv television .
" if we as europeans and as germans can help diplomatically , then we should .
we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts . " there will be no military engagement of germany in iraq , also not in the future , " voigt told the nordwest zeitung newspaper on thursday .
" this change of political course was urgently needed .
there must be an organized withdrawal . " syria stands behind report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james baker , the report 's author , is a former us secretary of state on thursday , syria called the baker commission report " objective . " " the report is objective , especially with regard to the role of iraq 's neighbors in achieving security and stability in the country , " a foreign ministry official told afp news service . the 160-page report recommends that the us government seek dialog with " all parties " in iraq outside the terrorist al qaeda organization .
the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .
israel 's ynet news site quoted peace now as demanding that the israeli government " not bury its head in the sand and ignore the explicit recommendations in the report . " there has been no official israeli reaction to the report . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader calls for more active european role in iraq german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .

" the turks are going to open a port and an airport , " said spokesman mikko norros , whose country holds the bloc 's presidency until the end of the month . he declined to say which locations could be opened or when it might happen . should ankara open to ships and planes flying the greek cypriot flag , it would be a step in the right direction , according to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " if these proposals are constructive , they could be a positive element for the discussions of the european council , " steinmeier said , referring to the european union summit in brussels next thursday and friday .
" turkey appears to be cautiously prepared to make a concession . " an eu official , speaking on condition of anonymity , could only partly confirm the information . " it 's about a turkish port in the mediterranean , a unilateral opening without conditions , " he said .
" it is certainly a new development , but it 's too early to say how it will all play out .

" for the safety of the talks , we will not share details with the media at this stage . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in october 2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose greek cypriot government , which ankara does not recognize . turkey has so far refused to open to greek cypriot vessels , despite signing a trade agreement to do so , until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a statelet endorsed only by ankara . endangered accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 last week , the european commission recommended slowing down turkey 's accession process by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that eu hopefuls have to complete to join . turkey 's candidacy has divided the 25 eu countries , and their ambassadors are struggling to find a common position for foreign ministers to endorse at a meeting in brussels on monday . no one , above all the finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on dec .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

" our industrial partners should be beacons in the fight against corruption .
the worst that could happen to us would be if one of our members were actively involved in corruption , " he said . a siemens spokesman said that the group was taking ti 's misgivings very seriously and would cooperate fully .
he added that siemens had filed a suit against the former chief of its telecoms activities in greece , demanding repayment of missing company money . the manager was removed from his post in april .
prosecutors are investigating the existence of overseas slush funds containing about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 266 million -rrb- , which siemens managers have allegedly used to pay bribes to obtain big contracts .
seven arrested so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this athen 's stadium built thanks to bribery ? press reports have claimed that some of the bribes may have gone to representatives of the greek interior and defense industries in the run-up to the athens olympic games in 2004 . the scandal might also involve the payment of massive bribes to representatives in the regime of the late nigerian dictator sani abacha . so far , seven former siemens executives have been arrested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy . " given the ability of iran and syria to influence events within iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in iraq , the united states should try to engage them constructively , " said the report , among other key recommendations . germany could play mediator 's role karsten voigt , the german foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation , told the berliner zeitung newspaper he sees us dialog with iran and syria as absolutely necessary .
he suggested that germans and europeans could help and mediate in talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt sees germany in the mediator 's role he added that the baker report 's recommendation for a strategy change in iraq and the middle east had met with international support . " we should be happy that there is a course correction in the united states , " voigt said on n-tv television .
" if we as europeans and as germans can help diplomatically , then we should .
we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts . " there will be no military engagement of germany in iraq , also not in the future , " voigt told the nordwest zeitung newspaper on thursday .
" this change of political course was urgently needed .
there must be an organized withdrawal . " syria stands behind report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james baker , the report 's author , is a former us secretary of state on thursday , syria called the baker commission report " objective . " " the report is objective , especially with regard to the role of iraq 's neighbors in achieving security and stability in the country , " a foreign ministry official told afp news service . the 160-page report recommends that the us government seek dialog with " all parties " in iraq outside the terrorist al qaeda organization .
the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .
israel 's ynet news site quoted peace now as demanding that the israeli government " not bury its head in the sand and ignore the explicit recommendations in the report .

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy . " given the ability of iran and syria to influence events within iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in iraq , the united states should try to engage them constructively , " said the report , among other key recommendations . germany could play mediator 's role karsten voigt , the german foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation , told the berliner zeitung newspaper he sees us dialog with iran and syria as absolutely necessary .
he suggested that germans and europeans could help and mediate in talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt sees germany in the mediator 's role he added that the baker report 's recommendation for a strategy change in iraq and the middle east had met with international support . " we should be happy that there is a course correction in the united states , " voigt said on n-tv television .
" if we as europeans and as germans can help diplomatically , then we should .
we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts . " there will be no military engagement of germany in iraq , also not in the future , " voigt told the nordwest zeitung newspaper on thursday .
" this change of political course was urgently needed .
there must be an organized withdrawal . " syria stands behind report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james baker , the report 's author , is a former us secretary of state on thursday , syria called the baker commission report " objective . " " the report is objective , especially with regard to the role of iraq 's neighbors in achieving security and stability in the country , " a foreign ministry official told afp news service . the 160-page report recommends that the us government seek dialog with " all parties " in iraq outside the terrorist al qaeda organization .
the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .
israel 's ynet news site quoted peace now as demanding that the israeli government " not bury its head in the sand and ignore the explicit recommendations in the report .

germany is no stranger to roasted meat , and sunday lunch is not exactly a hot-dog matter in most german families .

the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disputes over meat imports have been a sticking point in russia-poland ties senior polish official andrzej krawczyk said french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel promised to " mediate " between poland and russia on any food or energy problems in future , while taking into account kaczynski 's view that " gazprom is not a normal company , but a tool of russian national interests .

" poland has shown it is determined and has to be reckoned with , " a european diplomat told the eu observer .
" but now it is time to show that it is also a good partner and can find a constructive solution to the problem . " also at the talks , merkel raised the issue of russian non-cooperation with the british probe into the murder of ex-russian spy alexander litvinenko .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

now , a german scholar is making headlines with her tantalizingly tasty study of a great british tradition : the sunday roast . in those rare , spare moments , in which he would run out of eligible brides or stop being generally mean to his children , the red-bearded english king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- was a real gourmet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he loved his roast : king hery viii he loved being served a wide array of foods - ornate sweet or savory pies , quivering molded gelatins , rich puddings , tangy artichoke , roast pheasant and turkeys from newly discovered america , seasoned with funky spices from the orient - and in such enormous quantities that even his mighty , royal tummy occasionally had to give up . this meant , of course , that his fun-loving kitchen staff would from time to time be allowed to scrape off the leftovers and feel - in a 15th century version of the 15 minutes of fame - grateful to divine providence . roast meat became at the time a feature of every dinner .
oftentimes it was a piece of game , especially boar or venison , from an animal brought down by the king during his armed frolicking in the country .
-lrb- " try to lay low today , " his iconoclastic servants used to say .
" the fat one is going on a shooting spree again . " -rrb- good , old days in those days , a sunday roast was truly roasted - on a spit , turned slowly over an open fire and marinated continually by loyal servants .
a similar procedure was applied to witches and political opponents , but those were usually not served for dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still prefer to roast their meet the old-fashioned way today 's " roast , " which is prepared in an oven , is really nothing more than a glorified bake .
it lacks the delightful smoky taste that used to make henry viii jump up and down with pleasure after running his greasy fingers through his red beard .
it is nonetheless , a traditional british meal - served with potatoes , peas and carrots - and one of the truly universal traditions in anglophile culture . now , an enterprising young scholar from germany , continuing an ancient academic tradition , has decided to mix business with pleasure .
communications student rebecca carl , 26 , from leipzig in former communist east germany , has turned her research project into a respectable way of getting free food .
she is asking british families to open their hearts and hearths , and invite her to their homes on sundays . a unique tradition ? carl is planning to eat a sunday lunch with a different family each week until she gets her master 's degree in visual communication at swansea institute , in south wales .
she will document her visits , write down her observations , take digital photographs and tape conversations in order to get to the bottom of this " uniquely british-origin ritual . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other british culinary tradition is called fish and chips " my goal is to get around 10 families to take part , " carl said .
" back in germany , sunday lunch is nothing special .
here it is traditional . " many a german traditionalist will beg to differ .
germany is no stranger to roasted meat , and sunday lunch is not exactly a hot-dog matter in most german families .
but it is always good to appeal to the british sense of tradition - especially if one expects to get a free lunch of total strangers . carl is particularly interested in the social aspects of the sunday roast meal . " it 's not just about the food , " carl said .
" it 's about the communication and the pictures .
these things are important to me . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy . " given the ability of iran and syria to influence events within iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in iraq , the united states should try to engage them constructively , " said the report , among other key recommendations . germany could play mediator 's role karsten voigt , the german foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation , told the berliner zeitung newspaper he sees us dialog with iran and syria as absolutely necessary .
he suggested that germans and europeans could help and mediate in talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt sees germany in the mediator 's role he added that the baker report 's recommendation for a strategy change in iraq and the middle east had met with international support . " we should be happy that there is a course correction in the united states , " voigt said on n-tv television .
" if we as europeans and as germans can help diplomatically , then we should .
we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts . " there will be no military engagement of germany in iraq , also not in the future , " voigt told the nordwest zeitung newspaper on thursday .
" this change of political course was urgently needed .
there must be an organized withdrawal . " syria stands behind report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james baker , the report 's author , is a former us secretary of state on thursday , syria called the baker commission report " objective . " " the report is objective , especially with regard to the role of iraq 's neighbors in achieving security and stability in the country , " a foreign ministry official told afp news service . the 160-page report recommends that the us government seek dialog with " all parties " in iraq outside the terrorist al qaeda organization .
the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .
israel 's ynet news site quoted peace now as demanding that the israeli government " not bury its head in the sand and ignore the explicit recommendations in the report .

but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .
" the money should be invested in creative budgets and should ultimately be visible on the cinema screen .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

now , a german scholar is making headlines with her tantalizingly tasty study of a great british tradition : the sunday roast . in those rare , spare moments , in which he would run out of eligible brides or stop being generally mean to his children , the red-bearded english king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- was a real gourmet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he loved his roast : king hery viii he loved being served a wide array of foods - ornate sweet or savory pies , quivering molded gelatins , rich puddings , tangy artichoke , roast pheasant and turkeys from newly discovered america , seasoned with funky spices from the orient - and in such enormous quantities that even his mighty , royal tummy occasionally had to give up . this meant , of course , that his fun-loving kitchen staff would from time to time be allowed to scrape off the leftovers and feel - in a 15th century version of the 15 minutes of fame - grateful to divine providence . roast meat became at the time a feature of every dinner .
oftentimes it was a piece of game , especially boar or venison , from an animal brought down by the king during his armed frolicking in the country .
-lrb- " try to lay low today , " his iconoclastic servants used to say .
" the fat one is going on a shooting spree again . " -rrb- good , old days in those days , a sunday roast was truly roasted - on a spit , turned slowly over an open fire and marinated continually by loyal servants .
a similar procedure was applied to witches and political opponents , but those were usually not served for dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still prefer to roast their meet the old-fashioned way today 's " roast , " which is prepared in an oven , is really nothing more than a glorified bake .
it lacks the delightful smoky taste that used to make henry viii jump up and down with pleasure after running his greasy fingers through his red beard .
it is nonetheless , a traditional british meal - served with potatoes , peas and carrots - and one of the truly universal traditions in anglophile culture . now , an enterprising young scholar from germany , continuing an ancient academic tradition , has decided to mix business with pleasure .
communications student rebecca carl , 26 , from leipzig in former communist east germany , has turned her research project into a respectable way of getting free food .
she is asking british families to open their hearts and hearths , and invite her to their homes on sundays . a unique tradition ? carl is planning to eat a sunday lunch with a different family each week until she gets her master 's degree in visual communication at swansea institute , in south wales .
she will document her visits , write down her observations , take digital photographs and tape conversations in order to get to the bottom of this " uniquely british-origin ritual . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other british culinary tradition is called fish and chips " my goal is to get around 10 families to take part , " carl said .
" back in germany , sunday lunch is nothing special .
here it is traditional . " many a german traditionalist will beg to differ .
germany is no stranger to roasted meat , and sunday lunch is not exactly a hot-dog matter in most german families .
but it is always good to appeal to the british sense of tradition - especially if one expects to get a free lunch of total strangers . carl is particularly interested in the social aspects of the sunday roast meal . " it 's not just about the food , " carl said .
" it 's about the communication and the pictures .
these things are important to me . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

that negotiating mandate has not been resolved , but the poles have announced they will allow a meeting of the eu-russia permanent partnership council on energy , which they were also blocking , to take place on friday after all , diplomats told reuters news service . kaczynski : i feel solidarity " we talked about the meat issue , " kaczynski told the eu observer web site .
" i feel that we got a certain solidarity , a certain scope of solidarity , when it comes to all of the efforts to change the state of affairs . " he added that he hopes eu-russia treaty talks " will start a short time , not a long time , from now . " the eu had hoped to launch talks with russia earlier this year , for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal that expires at the end of next year .
the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disputes over meat imports have been a sticking point in russia-poland ties senior polish official andrzej krawczyk said french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel promised to " mediate " between poland and russia on any food or energy problems in future , while taking into account kaczynski 's view that " gazprom is not a normal company , but a tool of russian national interests . " " i hope to see this -lsb- veto -rsb- dispute resolved as soon as possible , " chirac said , adding that paris and berlin signed a poland-friendly joint declaration with warsaw . more sympathy for poland the statement said a " long-term partnership " with russia must be " based on equal rights in trade and energy " and that the eu 's joint energy policy must have a " spirit of solidarity " while promising to put " special attention " on eu-ukraine relations next year . meanwhile , limited eu sympathy for poland 's stance on russia is beginning to ebb . " poland has shown it is determined and has to be reckoned with , " a european diplomat told the eu observer .
" but now it is time to show that it is also a good partner and can find a constructive solution to the problem . " also at the talks , merkel raised the issue of russian non-cooperation with the british probe into the murder of ex-russian spy alexander litvinenko . " everything has to be done to clear up this case , " she said .
" russia would do well to cooperate on this .

" poland has shown it is determined and has to be reckoned with , " a european diplomat told the eu observer .
" but now it is time to show that it is also a good partner and can find a constructive solution to the problem . " also at the talks , merkel raised the issue of russian non-cooperation with the british probe into the murder of ex-russian spy alexander litvinenko .

now , a german scholar is making headlines with her tantalizingly tasty study of a great british tradition : the sunday roast . in those rare , spare moments , in which he would run out of eligible brides or stop being generally mean to his children , the red-bearded english king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- was a real gourmet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he loved his roast : king hery viii he loved being served a wide array of foods - ornate sweet or savory pies , quivering molded gelatins , rich puddings , tangy artichoke , roast pheasant and turkeys from newly discovered america , seasoned with funky spices from the orient - and in such enormous quantities that even his mighty , royal tummy occasionally had to give up . this meant , of course , that his fun-loving kitchen staff would from time to time be allowed to scrape off the leftovers and feel - in a 15th century version of the 15 minutes of fame - grateful to divine providence . roast meat became at the time a feature of every dinner .
oftentimes it was a piece of game , especially boar or venison , from an animal brought down by the king during his armed frolicking in the country .
-lrb- " try to lay low today , " his iconoclastic servants used to say .
" the fat one is going on a shooting spree again . " -rrb- good , old days in those days , a sunday roast was truly roasted - on a spit , turned slowly over an open fire and marinated continually by loyal servants .
a similar procedure was applied to witches and political opponents , but those were usually not served for dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still prefer to roast their meet the old-fashioned way today 's " roast , " which is prepared in an oven , is really nothing more than a glorified bake .
it lacks the delightful smoky taste that used to make henry viii jump up and down with pleasure after running his greasy fingers through his red beard .
it is nonetheless , a traditional british meal - served with potatoes , peas and carrots - and one of the truly universal traditions in anglophile culture . now , an enterprising young scholar from germany , continuing an ancient academic tradition , has decided to mix business with pleasure .
communications student rebecca carl , 26 , from leipzig in former communist east germany , has turned her research project into a respectable way of getting free food .
she is asking british families to open their hearts and hearths , and invite her to their homes on sundays . a unique tradition ? carl is planning to eat a sunday lunch with a different family each week until she gets her master 's degree in visual communication at swansea institute , in south wales .
she will document her visits , write down her observations , take digital photographs and tape conversations in order to get to the bottom of this " uniquely british-origin ritual . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other british culinary tradition is called fish and chips " my goal is to get around 10 families to take part , " carl said .
" back in germany , sunday lunch is nothing special .
here it is traditional . " many a german traditionalist will beg to differ .
germany is no stranger to roasted meat , and sunday lunch is not exactly a hot-dog matter in most german families .
but it is always good to appeal to the british sense of tradition - especially if one expects to get a free lunch of total strangers . carl is particularly interested in the social aspects of the sunday roast meal . " it 's not just about the food , " carl said .
" it 's about the communication and the pictures .
these things are important to me . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .
the building 's 1996 nomination as a world heritage site and the renovation have increased its national and international significance . dw staff / dpa -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ? -lrb- 21.08.2006 -rrb- living in a box for city dwellers , the word " loft " generally evokes sprawling , spartan space and individual yet fiercely voguish style .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 07.12.2006 new film fund aims to enhance german production image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film industry will get a cash boost , but will home-grown companies benefit ?
the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .
" the money should be invested in creative budgets and should ultimately be visible on the cinema screen .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .

" the world cup was not only a sporting success but also an economic , political and security success , " schäuble said at a press conference in the german capital .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .

in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .

the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "

from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .

" the turks are going to open a port and an airport , " said spokesman mikko norros , whose country holds the bloc 's presidency until the end of the month . he declined to say which locations could be opened or when it might happen . should ankara open to ships and planes flying the greek cypriot flag , it would be a step in the right direction , according to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " if these proposals are constructive , they could be a positive element for the discussions of the european council , " steinmeier said , referring to the european union summit in brussels next thursday and friday .

" talks are still under way , " a foreign ministry spokesman told the afp news agency .
" for the safety of the talks , we will not share details with the media at this stage . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in october 2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose greek cypriot government , which ankara does not recognize . turkey has so far refused to open to greek cypriot vessels , despite signing a trade agreement to do so , until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a statelet endorsed only by ankara . endangered accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 last week , the european commission recommended slowing down turkey 's accession process by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that eu hopefuls have to complete to join . turkey 's candidacy has divided the 25 eu countries , and their ambassadors are struggling to find a common position for foreign ministers to endorse at a meeting in brussels on monday . no one , above all the finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on dec .
14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast , mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed could , be integrated into the eu . but few doubt turkey 's strategic importance , led by a moderate islamic party , which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . no firm deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and merkel want an eu progress report on turkey by 2009 on tuesday , germany and france , two major opponents , backed away from their call to set a firm deadline for ankara to fulfill its obligations toward cyprus , which turkey invaded in 1974 in response to a greek cypriot coup . without mentioning an 18-month time limit , initially confirmed by the german government , chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac called for the eu commission to produce a progress report on turkey 's bid by spring 2009 . turkey is due to hold presidential and legislative elections next year , and a new leadership could have a different approach to relations with the eu . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu split over imposing tougher entry conditions on turkey european union leaders have divergent views on turkey 's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc , with germany and france set to call for tougher conditions on ankara .

that negotiating mandate has not been resolved , but the poles have announced they will allow a meeting of the eu-russia permanent partnership council on energy , which they were also blocking , to take place on friday after all , diplomats told reuters news service . kaczynski : i feel solidarity " we talked about the meat issue , " kaczynski told the eu observer web site .
" i feel that we got a certain solidarity , a certain scope of solidarity , when it comes to all of the efforts to change the state of affairs . " he added that he hopes eu-russia treaty talks " will start a short time , not a long time , from now . " the eu had hoped to launch talks with russia earlier this year , for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal that expires at the end of next year .
the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disputes over meat imports have been a sticking point in russia-poland ties senior polish official andrzej krawczyk said french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel promised to " mediate " between poland and russia on any food or energy problems in future , while taking into account kaczynski 's view that " gazprom is not a normal company , but a tool of russian national interests . " " i hope to see this -lsb- veto -rsb- dispute resolved as soon as possible , " chirac said , adding that paris and berlin signed a poland-friendly joint declaration with warsaw . more sympathy for poland the statement said a " long-term partnership " with russia must be " based on equal rights in trade and energy " and that the eu 's joint energy policy must have a " spirit of solidarity " while promising to put " special attention " on eu-ukraine relations next year . meanwhile , limited eu sympathy for poland 's stance on russia is beginning to ebb . " poland has shown it is determined and has to be reckoned with , " a european diplomat told the eu observer .
" but now it is time to show that it is also a good partner and can find a constructive solution to the problem . " also at the talks , merkel raised the issue of russian non-cooperation with the british probe into the murder of ex-russian spy alexander litvinenko . " everything has to be done to clear up this case , " she said .
" russia would do well to cooperate on this .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .

in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .

the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "

musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .

the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .

dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .

now , a german scholar is making headlines with her tantalizingly tasty study of a great british tradition : the sunday roast . in those rare , spare moments , in which he would run out of eligible brides or stop being generally mean to his children , the red-bearded english king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- was a real gourmet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he loved his roast : king hery viii he loved being served a wide array of foods - ornate sweet or savory pies , quivering molded gelatins , rich puddings , tangy artichoke , roast pheasant and turkeys from newly discovered america , seasoned with funky spices from the orient - and in such enormous quantities that even his mighty , royal tummy occasionally had to give up . this meant , of course , that his fun-loving kitchen staff would from time to time be allowed to scrape off the leftovers and feel - in a 15th century version of the 15 minutes of fame - grateful to divine providence . roast meat became at the time a feature of every dinner .
oftentimes it was a piece of game , especially boar or venison , from an animal brought down by the king during his armed frolicking in the country .

now , a german scholar is making headlines with her tantalizingly tasty study of a great british tradition : the sunday roast . in those rare , spare moments , in which he would run out of eligible brides or stop being generally mean to his children , the red-bearded english king henry viii -lrb- 1491-1547 -rrb- was a real gourmet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he loved his roast : king hery viii he loved being served a wide array of foods - ornate sweet or savory pies , quivering molded gelatins , rich puddings , tangy artichoke , roast pheasant and turkeys from newly discovered america , seasoned with funky spices from the orient - and in such enormous quantities that even his mighty , royal tummy occasionally had to give up . this meant , of course , that his fun-loving kitchen staff would from time to time be allowed to scrape off the leftovers and feel - in a 15th century version of the 15 minutes of fame - grateful to divine providence . roast meat became at the time a feature of every dinner .
oftentimes it was a piece of game , especially boar or venison , from an animal brought down by the king during his armed frolicking in the country .
-lrb- " try to lay low today , " his iconoclastic servants used to say .
" the fat one is going on a shooting spree again . " -rrb- good , old days in those days , a sunday roast was truly roasted - on a spit , turned slowly over an open fire and marinated continually by loyal servants .
a similar procedure was applied to witches and political opponents , but those were usually not served for dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still prefer to roast their meet the old-fashioned way today 's " roast , " which is prepared in an oven , is really nothing more than a glorified bake .
it lacks the delightful smoky taste that used to make henry viii jump up and down with pleasure after running his greasy fingers through his red beard .
it is nonetheless , a traditional british meal - served with potatoes , peas and carrots - and one of the truly universal traditions in anglophile culture . now , an enterprising young scholar from germany , continuing an ancient academic tradition , has decided to mix business with pleasure .
communications student rebecca carl , 26 , from leipzig in former communist east germany , has turned her research project into a respectable way of getting free food .

we are also ready to help with reconstruction in iraq , if the security situation permits . " while germans and europeans could help and mediate , their actions could not replace direct talks between the us and iran or syria , voigt added .
diplomats would just need to hope that iraq 's neighbors could contribute to stability there and need to be clear that they would not aid in military efforts .

the panel also called for a major international conference to make peace between israel and syria , including the return of the golan heights to syria , and to work on a final israeli-palestinian peace settlement . israel urged to pay attention the peace now protest group came out in support of the report , saying israel should study and implement its recommendations .

germany has offered its help in making the recommendations a reality . the panel 's recommendations , issued on wednesday , said only an urgent overhaul of the failed us policy in iraq could halt the blighted nation 's slide into anarchy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.12.2006 bauhaus building gets full makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated bauhaus building in dessau ten years after it was named a unesco world heritage site , dessau 's bauhaus building designed by the famous german architect walter gropius has been restored to its former glory . in 1919 , gropius -lrb- 1883-1969 -rrb- founded the bauhaus art and design school in weimar .
the idea was to train artists , architects and craftsmen under one roof .
his vision of the bauhaus was as a workshop with an open atmosphere , permitting and facilitating exploration and experimentation .
modern industrial design and architecture were very much influenced by the bauhaus principles of simple , pared-down elegance and functionality .
big names , such as gerhard marcks and lyonel feininger , were on the faculty almost from the start .
they were soon joined by paul klee , vassily kandinsky , laszlo moholy-nagy , and ludwig mies van der rohe , who later succeeded gropius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simple , elegant and functional - the marks of bauhaus design from the outset , however , the progressive art and design movement came under attack by political conservatives .
in 1926 , a nazi coalition took over the thuringian assembly and withdrew funding from the school , forcing it eventually to leave weimar .
dessau , in the heart of saxony-anhalt , was chosen over frankfurt am main and mannheim as the relocation site . gropius designed the main bauhaus faculty building and four " masters ' houses " for him and his colleagues to live in .
uniting art and technology for functional purposes , the main glass , concrete and steel structure that incorporated straight horizontal and vertical lines and the bauhaus logo , put the movement 's ideas into practice .
although dessau was badly damaged by wartime bombings , the bauhaus buildings survived . archeology of modernism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus logo on the dessau building the current executive director of the bauhaus dessau foundation is 58-year-old professor omar akbar .
born in afghanistan , akbar came to germany when he was 11 and later studied in berlin and stuttgart . visibly pleased with the results , which would also have pleased the movement 's founding-father , akbar told reporters that the renovation process had involved a team painstakingly chipping away at several coats of paint before reaching the first layer . thanks to the skill of the restorers , many of the beautiful details in the building had re-emerged , including door panels with an art deco touch , artistic lighting features , and rounded metal slots for door handles in walls , he said . the original subtle shades of burnt orange , acid-lemon , deep blue , and various pinks and reds had restored to the building an enhanced quality of warmth and space .
the artificial separation walls , which had divided the light , spacious rooms , had been removed , and the built-in windows had been freed of concrete .
the exterior black-and-whites had re-become gray-and-whites as intended . " the work has in itself been an archeology of modernism , " explained the professor , claiming an " entire work of art has been revealed through the restoration . "
in total , the restoration process took 10 years . from art and design to urban development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter gropius , the founder of bauhaus in recent years , the bauhaus dessau foundation has focused on urban development issues , becoming involved in large-scale town-planning projects in rio de janeiro and in mostar in bosnia-herzegovina , as well as in saxony-anhalt . as part of the renovation process , stage activity at dessau has also been reactivated .
musical and theatrical productions can now be held there as well as exhibitions . visitors to the revamped building can now leave the premises with a chunk of the original 1926 bauhaus structure , helping themselves from a huge box of pieces of torfoleum , a material comprising impregnated peat used in the 1920s for insulation purposes . an exhibition entitled " icon of modernism " which includes photos of the building before and after the restoration will run until march 2007 .
from spring 2007 , there will be a permanent exhibition about the building and its artists that will include letters , architects ' drawings , artworks , furniture and photos . according to the foundation , roughly 80,000 people have visited the museum annually in the past few years , drawing japanese and american tourists to the otherwise unremarkable city of dessau .

that negotiating mandate has not been resolved , but the poles have announced they will allow a meeting of the eu-russia permanent partnership council on energy , which they were also blocking , to take place on friday after all , diplomats told reuters news service . kaczynski : i feel solidarity " we talked about the meat issue , " kaczynski told the eu observer web site .
" i feel that we got a certain solidarity , a certain scope of solidarity , when it comes to all of the efforts to change the state of affairs . " he added that he hopes eu-russia treaty talks " will start a short time , not a long time , from now . " the eu had hoped to launch talks with russia earlier this year , for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal that expires at the end of next year .
the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disputes over meat imports have been a sticking point in russia-poland ties senior polish official andrzej krawczyk said french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel promised to " mediate " between poland and russia on any food or energy problems in future , while taking into account kaczynski 's view that " gazprom is not a normal company , but a tool of russian national interests . " " i hope to see this -lsb- veto -rsb- dispute resolved as soon as possible , " chirac said , adding that paris and berlin signed a poland-friendly joint declaration with warsaw . more sympathy for poland the statement said a " long-term partnership " with russia must be " based on equal rights in trade and energy " and that the eu 's joint energy policy must have a " spirit of solidarity " while promising to put " special attention " on eu-ukraine relations next year . meanwhile , limited eu sympathy for poland 's stance on russia is beginning to ebb . " poland has shown it is determined and has to be reckoned with , " a european diplomat told the eu observer .
" but now it is time to show that it is also a good partner and can find a constructive solution to the problem . " also at the talks , merkel raised the issue of russian non-cooperation with the british probe into the murder of ex-russian spy alexander litvinenko . " everything has to be done to clear up this case , " she said .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .
if you have a good scheme , combined in germany with other attractive opportunities , you can create attractive co-production opportunities , " meurer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's beloved kino international cinema and while the call for profitable co-productions is echoed right throughout the industry , schmidt-hug is worried that the application criteria make it less of a film fund , than a " hotelier fund , " which will attract and feed a disproportionate number of large-scale foreign productions . " there is greater emphasis on whether a film is shot in germany than whether it is made by a german , " he said .
" the money should be invested in creative budgets and should ultimately be visible on the cinema screen .

the german government is gearing up to launch a new film funding initiative designed to bolster the economy and nurture the nation 's cultural image .
but some believe it ignores the plight of experimental filmmakers . at first glance , the plan sounds like a further example of cultural charity , a chance for producers " with domicile or establishment in germany " to reclaim up to 20 percent of their production costs .
but on closer inspection , there is a definite economic overtone to the financial package which earmarks 60 million euros -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- annually for the next three years . in a document outlining the new initiative , the federal government commissioner for culture and the media -lrb- bkm -rrb- says the scheme is designed " to promote german film as a cultural good and to provoke a long-term impact on germany as a production location , with the accompanying economic effects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer 's latest film , " perfume , " was shot in barcelona the list of desired effects includes a greater number of productions , both domestic and foreign , shooting on location and in studios in germany , promotion of german creative talent , and a whole gamut of production sundries , ranging from print processing and lab work to music recording and sfx . enhanced production location image state secretary for media and culture bernd neumann said he believes the new model will make germany " more attractive as a production location for major international production companies , " thereby helping to create more jobs , and having " an impact on the economy that will be considerably higher than the amount provided in government assistance . " and that may turn out to be the case , but at this stage not everyone in the nation ’ s movie business is bubbling with enthusiam about the new plan .
steffen schmidt-hug , managing director of germany ’ s association of directors , has mixed feelings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs offbeat films like " halbe treppe " " the new model is a good thing for the film industry in so far as it can make small budgets that bit bigger , which in turn might mean bigger and better films , but smaller , more cultural films need funding too , " steffen schmidt-hug said . in order to qualify for one of the new production cost reimbursement grants , a feature film project has to have a budget of at least 1 million euros , a figure which is simply out of reach for many small and medium-sized companies . " the requirements are very tough for smaller companies , as they are also expected to secure a distributor from an approved list before they start shooting , " schmidt-hug said .
" the fact is that many films , particularly the more experimental , cultural ones , don ’ t have a distributor at that stage . " higher production value for berlin-based producer jens meurer , the case of culture versus the economy is not so black and white . " the bottom line is that all film is cultural , " he said .
" in my view cinema is a key cultural activity in any modern society , which makes this a cultural scheme with good economic side effects . " he believes the reimbursement scheme will lead to increased production value in german film . " filmmaking is a global business , there are funding schemes in every country , every region of the world , and there is competition between the regions .

the man had converted to islam when he married .
he went back to christianity later - but in malaysia only islamic courts can let muslims change faith .
last year , an islamic court ruled in favour of the religious authorities in a similar case that upset non-muslims .
the government now says its most senior civil lawyer will take on the case .
strained relations rayappan anthony converted to islam when he took a second wife , a muslim , in 1990 .
when that marriage failed , he went back to his first wife , a christian , and made a formal declaration that he would return to christianity .
but in malaysia , only islamic courts can permit a muslim legally to change faith and they almost invariably say no .
as a result , mr anthony 's body has been claimed by both the islamic department and his first wife 's family .
last year , an islamic court refused to hear from a hindu woman who wanted to claim the body of her well-known mountaineer husband .
m moorthy , after the religious authorities argued that he had secretly converted to islam .
non-muslims were outraged when malaysia 's civil courts decided they had no jurisdiction and refused to interfere .
so , perhaps sensitive to this , the government has given this latest case to the attorney-general , its top civil law officer , instead of the islamic court .
in the past year , relations between malaysia 's religious communities have become increasingly strained .
thousands from the ethnic malay majority have demonstrated against people being allowed to leave islam , while non-muslims have called for disputes involving islam and other faiths to be decided in a neutral forum .

an eight-week met police amnesty over the summer showed that , after a slight dip in knife-related crime , levels were back to normal within weeks , it said .
pre-amnesty there were an average of 34.9 daily knife offences in london , dropping to 31 in the amnesty .
six weeks later , that figure was 34.2 .
the report was obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act .
most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader more than 100,000 knives were handed into police forces in england , scotland and wales this summer during a five-week nationwide campaign and the amnesty was declared a success by ministers .
but an analysis of the concurrent but longer eight-week amnesty by the metropolitan police - between may and july - appears to question the effectiveness of the operation .
the report said " no changing trends " had been visible during the first five weeks of the operation from 15 may .
for the final three weeks of the operation and in the following weeks " a small downward trend appeared " .
" in late august 2006 - six weeks after the operation ends - offence levels tend to return to pre-operation values " , the report adds .
a spokesman for the metropolitan police said the force always recognised that a knife amnesty on its own was of limited effectiveness in tackling knife crime .
amnesties needed to be used in conjunction with other initiatives , the spokesman added .

the leaders , from both city and rural authorities in england , say elderly care services are " teetering on the brink " and are " unsustainable " .

letters obtained by bbc radio stoke show children 's minister beverley hughes forced the move on the city 's elected mayor mark meredith .
in october the mayor claimed he had " stepped in " to solve the problem but the letters show the government had raised concerns months earlier .
mr meredith has said he never tried to take credit for the government action .
in one letter , dated 15 march 2006 , the minister wrote to mr meredith saying a report into care provided by stoke city council showed there were " critical weaknesses " which could contribute to children being put at risk .
' tough stance ' a series of letters from ms hughes , which were released to the bbc under the freedom of information act , expressed further concerns that those weaknesses were not being addressed .
the letter says a " robust intervention " is necessary enlarge image on 19 october she wrote to the mayor saying she had invoked powers from the education act 1996 , to allow an outside company to take over the running of children 's services in the city from early next year .
in it she said she expected the co-operation of the council officials and members in implementing her department 's wishes .
" however , in view of the risks to children 's safety , if such co-operation is not forthcoming , i am minded also to direct whatever is expedient immediately in order to ensure that the tender process proceeds swiftly and effectively . "
in a press release headlined mayor seeks major improvement in children 's services , and issued on 25 october , mr meredith did not reveal the government 's tough stance .
it said the mayor had " stepped in after concerns were expressed about the quality of care for vulnerable children " .
it went on : " it 's time for radical action .
i believe we need to consider all options .
" this includes involving outside support and the department for education and skills has indicated that it will help us -lsb- with -rsb- extra resources to enable us to deliver a modern , effective and caring service which the young people of this city have a right to expect . "
mr meredith refused to appear on bbc radio stoke 's breakfast programme on thursday but said he would comment about the issue on friday .
but he did tell the bbc he has never tried to take the credit for the government getting involved with children 's services .
conservative councillor roger ibbs said : " this information was not given to councillors , the information was kept from us and only recently has the letter come to light .
" that ca n't be right and i 'm afraid it 's part of the system we have . "
