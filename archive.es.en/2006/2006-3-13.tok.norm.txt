but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .

" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation .

" we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work .

" for years we were fine living with a theft detection rate of between 30 and 50 percent , and i think it would be out of balance for politicians to promote surveillance to bring the detection rate to 75 percent or more . " " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later . " i am only afraid of the day when there is actually an attack in germany , because then reason might fly out the window , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .

but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .
but privacy advocates argue the public should not have the minutiae of their personal lives scrutinized . courts judge extent of privacy protection " technological developments see to it that privacy is slowly but permanently declining , " said roland schäfer of the german association for data protection .
" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation . " the legal privacy protections are not only good , i find them to be totally exaggerated in a number of areas , " said thomas mischke of the chairman of the national german detectives association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit and discount cards tell marketers a lot about a person 's shopping habits balance between privacy and security people willingly hand personal information over to marketers for the chance to win a prize or to get a discount when shopping , while the police are limited to focused warrants that usually require a judge 's approval , mischke added . privacy protection regulations and laws dictating how far law enforcement officials are allowed to go can keep police from using the technological tools at their disposal like phone and video surveillance . " we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work . " new legislation could be the answer privacy rights groups , as well as peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , say germany needs to rethink the way its laws deal with the powers given to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police would like it to be easier to put surveillance cameras in place " we need an open discussion of what the public is willing to accept , " schäfer of the data protection association added .
" for years we were fine living with a theft detection rate of between 30 and 50 percent , and i think it would be out of balance for politicians to promote surveillance to bring the detection rate to 75 percent or more . " " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later . " i am only afraid of the day when there is actually an attack in germany , because then reason might fly out the window , " he said .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government . " by promoting a serial killer into a national hero his victims are murdered again and serbia disgraces itself ... as the state in which crime is a supreme virtue , " draskovic said . a divided cou n try bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic , serbian pro-western reformer , was assassinated in 2003 sunday also marked the third anniversary since the assassination of zoran djindjic , reformist prime-minister and the man who sent milosevic to the hague .
thousands gathered to pay tribute to djindjic , who was shot by members of the criminal structures which rose to power during milosevic 's reign .
their trial is underway in belgrade . the afternoon memorial at the sava centar conference hall was attended by djindjic 's wife ruzica , members of his democratic party including pro-western serbian president boris tadic , and us ambassador michael polt . " three years after the assassination of mr djindjic , serbia is where it was three years before he took power , " said zoran zivkovic , who had been the late premier 's immediate successor . where will milosevic be buried ? two days after milosevic died , it is still unclear where he will be buried as his wife mira markovic , who is wanted on fraud charges in serbia and has an interpol arrest warrant issued in her name , is reportedly living in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's death may have destabilizing effects on the domestic political scene in serbia serbian president boris tadic 's office said : " the president believes a national funeral for slobodan milosevic would be completely inappropriate because of the role that he played in serbia 's recent history , and contrary to the direction the people of serbia clearly showed on october 5 , 2000 , " referring to his ouster in a popular uprising . but officials of milosevic 's socialist party said they would bring down the serbian government if it fails to comply with a demand for his funeral to be held in his homeland . " i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government . " by promoting a serial killer into a national hero his victims are murdered again and serbia disgraces itself ... as the state in which crime is a supreme virtue , " draskovic said . a divided cou n try bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic , serbian pro-western reformer , was assassinated in 2003 sunday also marked the third anniversary since the assassination of zoran djindjic , reformist prime-minister and the man who sent milosevic to the hague .
thousands gathered to pay tribute to djindjic , who was shot by members of the criminal structures which rose to power during milosevic 's reign .
their trial is underway in belgrade . the afternoon memorial at the sava centar conference hall was attended by djindjic 's wife ruzica , members of his democratic party including pro-western serbian president boris tadic , and us ambassador michael polt . " three years after the assassination of mr djindjic , serbia is where it was three years before he took power , " said zoran zivkovic , who had been the late premier 's immediate successor . where will milosevic be buried ? two days after milosevic died , it is still unclear where he will be buried as his wife mira markovic , who is wanted on fraud charges in serbia and has an interpol arrest warrant issued in her name , is reportedly living in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's death may have destabilizing effects on the domestic political scene in serbia serbian president boris tadic 's office said : " the president believes a national funeral for slobodan milosevic would be completely inappropriate because of the role that he played in serbia 's recent history , and contrary to the direction the people of serbia clearly showed on october 5 , 2000 , " referring to his ouster in a popular uprising . but officials of milosevic 's socialist party said they would bring down the serbian government if it fails to comply with a demand for his funeral to be held in his homeland . " i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

" the work by spanish artist santiago sierra is called " 245 cubic meters " and consists of a former jewish synagogue in the western town of pulhein near cologne .
sierra hooked up the exhaust pipes of six cars to tubes that pump poisonous gas inside . the synagogue was used by the nazis as a stable but survived world war ii unscathed .
it has been used as a community center since 1991 . visitors on sunday lined up to enter the building for a few minutes accompanied by a firefighter and wearing protective masks to shield them from the deadly concentration of carbon monoxide inside . sierra , who was not present for the opening , said in a written statement that the shocking project was aimed to stop complacency in the face of the nazis ' mass extermination of the jews in death camp gas chambers . he plans to stage it every sunday through april 30 , with a break for easter on april 16 . germa n jews say work is offe n sive the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , stephan j. kramer , said the work was deeply offensive and asked why the project appeared to target holocaust victims and not the perpetrators of the nazi crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist wants to keep the memory of jews killed by the nazi alive however , the mayor of pulheim , karl august morisse , said he could not imagine " that someone would feel offended because the meaning of the work is so apparent .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .

the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "

merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .

obviously , the ticket packages , which are oriented towards companies and wealthy fans , do n't come cheap . to watch four group matches , a quarter-final and the final in berlin in the very best seats , so-called sky boxes , which seat 10 to 20 people , you would have to pay between 156,000 and 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,700 to $ 400,000 -rrb- .
those who manage to get their hands on a highly sought-after hospitality package can watch three games for only 1,900 euros . but you 'd better hurry , because even those tickets are running out . ise paid world soccer federation fifa 175.5 million euros for the right to sell the 346,000 vip tickets for boxes and business seats in the 12 arenas where world cup will take place this summer .
experts estimate that vip seats will bring in around 500 million euros . those who pay top dollar - or euro - for the very best will be pampered with reserved parking right next to the stadium .
meanwhile , normal ticket holders will have at least three kilometers -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- to cover , either by foot or public transportation , to get to their seats .

once they 're in , they 'll already be able to eat , drink and make merry two hours before kick-off in specially constructed hospitality tents , said peter csanadi , a spokesman for ise . they 'll have the privilege of full catering during half time as well as after the game .
around 10,000 waiters and waitresses will be on hand to serve the 346,000 customers , and 8,000 hostesses will be at their beck and call . but hospitality tent may be the wrong description for the places where the vips will while away their time , said stefan bartosch , managing director of de boer , the company that is making the constructions for the 12 stadiums . " we 're building temporary rooms , " bartosch said .
the tents are more like small cities .
" this city will be many 10,000 square meters -lrb- hundreds of thousands of square feet -rrb- in size , with its own kitchens , living rooms , with deck chairs , terraces , with everything you can imagine . " and beyond providing wealthy customers with their money 's worth , the luxurious treatment has another aim .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .

" that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .
a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic wrote of poison threat , legal aide says slobodan milosevic claimed a day before his death that he risked being poisoned , his legal advisor said sunday , fueling swirling rumors over the demise of the former yugoslav leader while on trial for war crimes .

obviously , the ticket packages , which are oriented towards companies and wealthy fans , do n't come cheap . to watch four group matches , a quarter-final and the final in berlin in the very best seats , so-called sky boxes , which seat 10 to 20 people , you would have to pay between 156,000 and 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,700 to $ 400,000 -rrb- .
those who manage to get their hands on a highly sought-after hospitality package can watch three games for only 1,900 euros . but you 'd better hurry , because even those tickets are running out . ise paid world soccer federation fifa 175.5 million euros for the right to sell the 346,000 vip tickets for boxes and business seats in the 12 arenas where world cup will take place this summer .
experts estimate that vip seats will bring in around 500 million euros . those who pay top dollar - or euro - for the very best will be pampered with reserved parking right next to the stadium .
meanwhile , normal ticket holders will have at least three kilometers -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- to cover , either by foot or public transportation , to get to their seats .
maki n g memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vip lounge at leipzig 's zentralstadion well-heeled fans will also have their own entrance to ensure they make it into the vip area as smoothly as possible .
once they 're in , they 'll already be able to eat , drink and make merry two hours before kick-off in specially constructed hospitality tents , said peter csanadi , a spokesman for ise . they 'll have the privilege of full catering during half time as well as after the game .
around 10,000 waiters and waitresses will be on hand to serve the 346,000 customers , and 8,000 hostesses will be at their beck and call . but hospitality tent may be the wrong description for the places where the vips will while away their time , said stefan bartosch , managing director of de boer , the company that is making the constructions for the 12 stadiums . " we 're building temporary rooms , " bartosch said .
the tents are more like small cities .
" this city will be many 10,000 square meters -lrb- hundreds of thousands of square feet -rrb- in size , with its own kitchens , living rooms , with deck chairs , terraces , with everything you can imagine . " and beyond providing wealthy customers with their money 's worth , the luxurious treatment has another aim .

former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .
but privacy advocates argue the public should not have the minutiae of their personal lives scrutinized . courts judge extent of privacy protection " technological developments see to it that privacy is slowly but permanently declining , " said roland schäfer of the german association for data protection .
" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation . " the legal privacy protections are not only good , i find them to be totally exaggerated in a number of areas , " said thomas mischke of the chairman of the national german detectives association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit and discount cards tell marketers a lot about a person 's shopping habits balance between privacy and security people willingly hand personal information over to marketers for the chance to win a prize or to get a discount when shopping , while the police are limited to focused warrants that usually require a judge 's approval , mischke added . privacy protection regulations and laws dictating how far law enforcement officials are allowed to go can keep police from using the technological tools at their disposal like phone and video surveillance . " we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work . " new legislation could be the answer privacy rights groups , as well as peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , say germany needs to rethink the way its laws deal with the powers given to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police would like it to be easier to put surveillance cameras in place " we need an open discussion of what the public is willing to accept , " schäfer of the data protection association added .
" for years we were fine living with a theft detection rate of between 30 and 50 percent , and i think it would be out of balance for politicians to promote surveillance to bring the detection rate to 75 percent or more . " " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later . " i am only afraid of the day when there is actually an attack in germany , because then reason might fly out the window , " he said .
" until now germany has kept a very good balance and given the police only as much power as they need .

but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .

" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation .

" we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work .

" " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government . " by promoting a serial killer into a national hero his victims are murdered again and serbia disgraces itself ... as the state in which crime is a supreme virtue , " draskovic said . a divided cou n try bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic , serbian pro-western reformer , was assassinated in 2003 sunday also marked the third anniversary since the assassination of zoran djindjic , reformist prime-minister and the man who sent milosevic to the hague .
thousands gathered to pay tribute to djindjic , who was shot by members of the criminal structures which rose to power during milosevic 's reign .
their trial is underway in belgrade . the afternoon memorial at the sava centar conference hall was attended by djindjic 's wife ruzica , members of his democratic party including pro-western serbian president boris tadic , and us ambassador michael polt . " three years after the assassination of mr djindjic , serbia is where it was three years before he took power , " said zoran zivkovic , who had been the late premier 's immediate successor . where will milosevic be buried ? two days after milosevic died , it is still unclear where he will be buried as his wife mira markovic , who is wanted on fraud charges in serbia and has an interpol arrest warrant issued in her name , is reportedly living in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's death may have destabilizing effects on the domestic political scene in serbia serbian president boris tadic 's office said : " the president believes a national funeral for slobodan milosevic would be completely inappropriate because of the role that he played in serbia 's recent history , and contrary to the direction the people of serbia clearly showed on october 5 , 2000 , " referring to his ouster in a popular uprising . but officials of milosevic 's socialist party said they would bring down the serbian government if it fails to comply with a demand for his funeral to be held in his homeland . " i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation .

" we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator .

former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.03.2006 world cup tickets for the well-heeled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vip view : lounge at dortmund 's westfalenstadion for those who have everything but soccer world cup tickets , dw-world might have the answer - assuming money 's no object . international sports entertainment -lrb- ise -rrb- is the place to contact for access to the best tickets in germany 's world cup stadiums .
obviously , the ticket packages , which are oriented towards companies and wealthy fans , do n't come cheap . to watch four group matches , a quarter-final and the final in berlin in the very best seats , so-called sky boxes , which seat 10 to 20 people , you would have to pay between 156,000 and 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,700 to $ 400,000 -rrb- .
those who manage to get their hands on a highly sought-after hospitality package can watch three games for only 1,900 euros . but you 'd better hurry , because even those tickets are running out . ise paid world soccer federation fifa 175.5 million euros for the right to sell the 346,000 vip tickets for boxes and business seats in the 12 arenas where world cup will take place this summer .
experts estimate that vip seats will bring in around 500 million euros . those who pay top dollar - or euro - for the very best will be pampered with reserved parking right next to the stadium .
meanwhile , normal ticket holders will have at least three kilometers -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- to cover , either by foot or public transportation , to get to their seats .
maki n g memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vip lounge at leipzig 's zentralstadion well-heeled fans will also have their own entrance to ensure they make it into the vip area as smoothly as possible .
once they 're in , they 'll already be able to eat , drink and make merry two hours before kick-off in specially constructed hospitality tents , said peter csanadi , a spokesman for ise . they 'll have the privilege of full catering during half time as well as after the game .
around 10,000 waiters and waitresses will be on hand to serve the 346,000 customers , and 8,000 hostesses will be at their beck and call . but hospitality tent may be the wrong description for the places where the vips will while away their time , said stefan bartosch , managing director of de boer , the company that is making the constructions for the 12 stadiums . " we 're building temporary rooms , " bartosch said .
the tents are more like small cities .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

obviously , the ticket packages , which are oriented towards companies and wealthy fans , do n't come cheap . to watch four group matches , a quarter-final and the final in berlin in the very best seats , so-called sky boxes , which seat 10 to 20 people , you would have to pay between 156,000 and 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,700 to $ 400,000 -rrb- .
those who manage to get their hands on a highly sought-after hospitality package can watch three games for only 1,900 euros . but you 'd better hurry , because even those tickets are running out . ise paid world soccer federation fifa 175.5 million euros for the right to sell the 346,000 vip tickets for boxes and business seats in the 12 arenas where world cup will take place this summer .
experts estimate that vip seats will bring in around 500 million euros . those who pay top dollar - or euro - for the very best will be pampered with reserved parking right next to the stadium .
meanwhile , normal ticket holders will have at least three kilometers -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- to cover , either by foot or public transportation , to get to their seats .

once they 're in , they 'll already be able to eat , drink and make merry two hours before kick-off in specially constructed hospitality tents , said peter csanadi , a spokesman for ise . they 'll have the privilege of full catering during half time as well as after the game .
around 10,000 waiters and waitresses will be on hand to serve the 346,000 customers , and 8,000 hostesses will be at their beck and call . but hospitality tent may be the wrong description for the places where the vips will while away their time , said stefan bartosch , managing director of de boer , the company that is making the constructions for the 12 stadiums . " we 're building temporary rooms , " bartosch said .
the tents are more like small cities .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward .

former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government . " by promoting a serial killer into a national hero his victims are murdered again and serbia disgraces itself ... as the state in which crime is a supreme virtue , " draskovic said . a divided cou n try bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic , serbian pro-western reformer , was assassinated in 2003 sunday also marked the third anniversary since the assassination of zoran djindjic , reformist prime-minister and the man who sent milosevic to the hague .
thousands gathered to pay tribute to djindjic , who was shot by members of the criminal structures which rose to power during milosevic 's reign .
their trial is underway in belgrade . the afternoon memorial at the sava centar conference hall was attended by djindjic 's wife ruzica , members of his democratic party including pro-western serbian president boris tadic , and us ambassador michael polt . " three years after the assassination of mr djindjic , serbia is where it was three years before he took power , " said zoran zivkovic , who had been the late premier 's immediate successor . where will milosevic be buried ? two days after milosevic died , it is still unclear where he will be buried as his wife mira markovic , who is wanted on fraud charges in serbia and has an interpol arrest warrant issued in her name , is reportedly living in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's death may have destabilizing effects on the domestic political scene in serbia serbian president boris tadic 's office said : " the president believes a national funeral for slobodan milosevic would be completely inappropriate because of the role that he played in serbia 's recent history , and contrary to the direction the people of serbia clearly showed on october 5 , 2000 , " referring to his ouster in a popular uprising . but officials of milosevic 's socialist party said they would bring down the serbian government if it fails to comply with a demand for his funeral to be held in his homeland . " i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government . " by promoting a serial killer into a national hero his victims are murdered again and serbia disgraces itself ... as the state in which crime is a supreme virtue , " draskovic said . a divided cou n try bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic , serbian pro-western reformer , was assassinated in 2003 sunday also marked the third anniversary since the assassination of zoran djindjic , reformist prime-minister and the man who sent milosevic to the hague .
thousands gathered to pay tribute to djindjic , who was shot by members of the criminal structures which rose to power during milosevic 's reign .
their trial is underway in belgrade . the afternoon memorial at the sava centar conference hall was attended by djindjic 's wife ruzica , members of his democratic party including pro-western serbian president boris tadic , and us ambassador michael polt . " three years after the assassination of mr djindjic , serbia is where it was three years before he took power , " said zoran zivkovic , who had been the late premier 's immediate successor . where will milosevic be buried ? two days after milosevic died , it is still unclear where he will be buried as his wife mira markovic , who is wanted on fraud charges in serbia and has an interpol arrest warrant issued in her name , is reportedly living in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's death may have destabilizing effects on the domestic political scene in serbia serbian president boris tadic 's office said : " the president believes a national funeral for slobodan milosevic would be completely inappropriate because of the role that he played in serbia 's recent history , and contrary to the direction the people of serbia clearly showed on october 5 , 2000 , " referring to his ouster in a popular uprising . but officials of milosevic 's socialist party said they would bring down the serbian government if it fails to comply with a demand for his funeral to be held in his homeland . " i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

" i told the ruling majority that they can not expect the sps to enter parliament if slobodan milosevic is not buried in a dignified way in belgrade , " said zoran andjelkovic , a senior official of the socialist party of serbia . " by dignified , we mean that members of his family can come to the funeral and get the right to stay in serbia and to find an adequate place at the cemetery , a place worthy of a historic person , " said andjelkovic , a parliamentary deputy and sps secretary-general . the minority coalition government of serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica depends on the support of at least four out of 22 sps deputies in the balkan state 's 250-seat parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic died of heart attack , un says former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic died of a heart attack , the un war crimes court said , but refused completely to rule out a poisoning theory as it prepared his body for release monday .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .

but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .
but privacy advocates argue the public should not have the minutiae of their personal lives scrutinized . courts judge extent of privacy protection " technological developments see to it that privacy is slowly but permanently declining , " said roland schäfer of the german association for data protection .
" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation . " the legal privacy protections are not only good , i find them to be totally exaggerated in a number of areas , " said thomas mischke of the chairman of the national german detectives association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit and discount cards tell marketers a lot about a person 's shopping habits balance between privacy and security people willingly hand personal information over to marketers for the chance to win a prize or to get a discount when shopping , while the police are limited to focused warrants that usually require a judge 's approval , mischke added . privacy protection regulations and laws dictating how far law enforcement officials are allowed to go can keep police from using the technological tools at their disposal like phone and video surveillance . " we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work . " new legislation could be the answer privacy rights groups , as well as peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , say germany needs to rethink the way its laws deal with the powers given to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police would like it to be easier to put surveillance cameras in place " we need an open discussion of what the public is willing to accept , " schäfer of the data protection association added .
" for years we were fine living with a theft detection rate of between 30 and 50 percent , and i think it would be out of balance for politicians to promote surveillance to bring the detection rate to 75 percent or more . " " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later . " i am only afraid of the day when there is actually an attack in germany , because then reason might fly out the window , " he said .
" until now germany has kept a very good balance and given the police only as much power as they need .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

sierra hooked up the exhaust pipes of six cars to tubes that pump poisonous gas inside . the synagogue was used by the nazis as a stable but survived world war ii unscathed .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges .

reactions are mixed , while the tension surrounding the question of his funeral is on the rise . from pride in his leadership to shame at his memory , the death of former serbian president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the un war crimes court in the hague , where he was standing trial for genocide and war crimes , inspired an emotional response that deeply divided his homeland . dozens of hardcore milosevic loyalists queued in the rain on sunday to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's followers are mourning the loss of their hero a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the marble-coated building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . his supporters , mostly of them elderly , waited patiently for their turn to pen messages .
one saluted milosevic 's photo then left the hall , tears in his eyes . meanwhile senior officials of the socialist party of serbia -lrb- sps -rrb- - which milosevic still formally headed until his death - gathered in a nearby hall in emergency session . in a brief speech , sps official ivica dacic voiced " deepest condolences " in the name of his party to milosevic 's family .
" slobodan milosevic did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " he said . " by refusing to let him go to moscow for medical treatment , the tribunal signed his death sentence , " dacic stated .
his death was an " irreparable loss for serbia , its citizens and the sps . " tur n i n g a serial killer i n to a n atio n al hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic said he was " ashamed " by the reactions of milosevic 's die-hard followers . " his supporters ' grief for the man who was responsible for countless crimes and who personally ordered numerous murders has been turned into eulogies for the deceased , " draskovic told tanjug news agency . milosevic 's policies had only produced " death , misfortune and hatred , " said draskovic , who was a fierce critic of the autocratic regime of the former serbian and yugoslav president in the 1990s , but also , for a short period of time , a minister in milosevic 's government .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .
a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the building .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .

sierra hooked up the exhaust pipes of six cars to tubes that pump poisonous gas inside . the synagogue was used by the nazis as a stable but survived world war ii unscathed .
it has been used as a community center since 1991 . visitors on sunday lined up to enter the building for a few minutes accompanied by a firefighter and wearing protective masks to shield them from the deadly concentration of carbon monoxide inside . sierra , who was not present for the opening , said in a written statement that the shocking project was aimed to stop complacency in the face of the nazis ' mass extermination of the jews in death camp gas chambers . he plans to stage it every sunday through april 30 , with a break for easter on april 16 . germa n jews say work is offe n sive the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , stephan j. kramer , said the work was deeply offensive and asked why the project appeared to target holocaust victims and not the perpetrators of the nazi crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist wants to keep the memory of jews killed by the nazi alive however , the mayor of pulheim , karl august morisse , said he could not imagine " that someone would feel offended because the meaning of the work is so apparent .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .
a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the building . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic wrote of poison threat , legal aide says slobodan milosevic claimed a day before his death that he risked being poisoned , his legal advisor said sunday , fueling swirling rumors over the demise of the former yugoslav leader while on trial for war crimes .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days . " a tribunal statement said the former serb leader 's body would be released to his family on monday . widow claims milosevic was killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un tribunal was aiming for a conviction and more information milosevic 's widow mirjana markovic said the tribunal had effectively killed her husband " because they did n't have enough -lrb- proof -rrb- to convict him , and they could n't let him go . " he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .
a big photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid out on a table in the entrance hall of the building .

" the work by spanish artist santiago sierra is called " 245 cubic meters " and consists of a former jewish synagogue in the western town of pulhein near cologne .
sierra hooked up the exhaust pipes of six cars to tubes that pump poisonous gas inside . the synagogue was used by the nazis as a stable but survived world war ii unscathed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .

" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "

"
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

" two days earlier , energy ministers from the rich g8 nations - which include britain , france , germany and italy - will hold talks in moscow . " we want to work with russia on energy security in a positive and constructive way , " barroso said last week .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation . " i n creasi n gly depe n de n t russia supplies around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and the commission fears that the eu could become increasingly reliant on imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso wants an an energy pact with russia " if no measures are taken , in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 percent of the union 's energy requirements , compared to 50 percent today , will be covered by imported products , " the executive argues in its green paper . the dispute between russia and ukraine , through which pipelines cross to supply some eu states , also highlighted the value of energy as a foreign policy tool , as the gas cuts brought kiev to its knees in a particularly cold winter . " we are now moving toward considering whether it would be a good idea to have higher levels of gas stocks , " since the crisis , said a senior official with the austrian eu presidency .
" this is very expensive to do and it is not always straight forward . " i n creasi n g protectio n ism on the domestic front , the energy ministers will also take note of the commission 's warning to interpret gas and electricity regulations " according to their spirit and not just their letter . " the concern has come amid soaring energy prices and a wave of energy sector takeovers , as some countries try to protect domestic firms even though europe is preparing to fully liberalize its market by july next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused a disruption to supplies to the eu spain may change its laws to make it more difficult for german energy giant e.on to take over spanish group endesa , while france announced the merger of state-controlled gaz de france with suez , in a move that italy complains was to thwart a bid by italian group enel for suez . the green paper maintains that it is time to open up rather than consolidate if energy consumers are to be given real non-discriminatory access to gas and electricity supplies from different national networks . the commission has even floated the idea of a " european energy regulator . " but according to one eu diplomat , " many countries are likely to find that it goes too far and that for now harmonization is better .

schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

according to yousuf , their bodies were dumped in the kandahar-helmand areas in the southern part of the country . " these people have come to afghanistan on behest of america , hence they should be sentenced to death , " yousuf had said in an earlier statement .

but when it comes to new , emerging technologies , there is still a grey area around how much and what information can , or should , be used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and privacy groups both look to the courts for help police and other government officials would like to take advantage of technology 's ability to gather data to help prosecute crimes .
but privacy advocates argue the public should not have the minutiae of their personal lives scrutinized . courts judge extent of privacy protection " technological developments see to it that privacy is slowly but permanently declining , " said roland schäfer of the german association for data protection .
" the courts , however , have a tendency to lean the other way with judges seeing that it stays relatively stable . " constitutional laws give germans the right to decide with whom and for what purpose their personal information is shared and requires the police prove that any intrusion into people 's private lives is necessary for a case 's investigation . " the legal privacy protections are not only good , i find them to be totally exaggerated in a number of areas , " said thomas mischke of the chairman of the national german detectives association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit and discount cards tell marketers a lot about a person 's shopping habits balance between privacy and security people willingly hand personal information over to marketers for the chance to win a prize or to get a discount when shopping , while the police are limited to focused warrants that usually require a judge 's approval , mischke added . privacy protection regulations and laws dictating how far law enforcement officials are allowed to go can keep police from using the technological tools at their disposal like phone and video surveillance . " we need legislation in the field of telecommunications to be modified , " mischke said .
" privacy is naturally very important , but it can sometimes severely hinder our work . " new legislation could be the answer privacy rights groups , as well as peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , say germany needs to rethink the way its laws deal with the powers given to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police would like it to be easier to put surveillance cameras in place " we need an open discussion of what the public is willing to accept , " schäfer of the data protection association added .
" for years we were fine living with a theft detection rate of between 30 and 50 percent , and i think it would be out of balance for politicians to promote surveillance to bring the detection rate to 75 percent or more . " " in general there is too much data being collected and people are poorly informed on what happens with it , " schäfer said . though mischke said new laws are n't needed to increase security , he agreed additional dialogue would be beneficial when dealing with the conflict between privacy and law enforcement - and it is a subject that he said should be addressed sooner rather than later . " i am only afraid of the day when there is actually an attack in germany , because then reason might fly out the window , " he said .
" until now germany has kept a very good balance and given the police only as much power as they need .

sierra hooked up the exhaust pipes of six cars to tubes that pump poisonous gas inside . the synagogue was used by the nazis as a stable but survived world war ii unscathed .
it has been used as a community center since 1991 . visitors on sunday lined up to enter the building for a few minutes accompanied by a firefighter and wearing protective masks to shield them from the deadly concentration of carbon monoxide inside . sierra , who was not present for the opening , said in a written statement that the shocking project was aimed to stop complacency in the face of the nazis ' mass extermination of the jews in death camp gas chambers . he plans to stage it every sunday through april 30 , with a break for easter on april 16 . germa n jews say work is offe n sive the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , stephan j. kramer , said the work was deeply offensive and asked why the project appeared to target holocaust victims and not the perpetrators of the nazi crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist wants to keep the memory of jews killed by the nazi alive however , the mayor of pulheim , karl august morisse , said he could not imagine " that someone would feel offended because the meaning of the work is so apparent .

" the autopsy was carried out amid reports that milosevic , who had a history of heart problems , may have been poisoned or taken his own life . he was found dead in his cell saturday at the court , where he had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the balkans conflicts . a self-inflicted illness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic was accused of war crimes committed against non-serbs in kosovo , croatia and bosnia prosecutors at the un war crimes tribunal repeatedly accused milosevic of tampering with his medication to manipulate the proceedings , a practice that may have sparked the former yugoslav strongman 's fatal heart attack . the health of the former yugoslav president and his alleged unwillingness to follow the medical regime prescribed by his dutch doctors was a constant source of conflict during the trial , with the prosecution even accusing milosevic of fraud . a dutch toxicologist who examined milosevic 's blood two weeks ago told afp on monday that he believed milosevic had deliberately taken a contra-indicated medicine that countered the effects of his heart medication . " i am sure that he took the medicine himself because he wanted a one-way ticket to moscow , " said dutch toxicologist donald uges . " that is why he took rifampicin , " a powerful antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial diseases including leprosy and tuberculosis , he added . although milosevic had private doctors , it is not clear exactly how he would have obtained such drugs while in detention . uges , a toxicologist at the university of groningen , said he examined 64-year-old milosevic at the request of dutch doctors who wanted to know why the war crimes suspect 's blood pressure was not dropping despite the medication he was taking . too early for final result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic backers in belgrade in 2001 serbian experts who attended the autopsy declared their satisfaction at how it had been conducted by dutch pathologists . a toxicological examination was still being carried out and a final autopsy report will be issued as soon as possible , the court said . " it is too early to reach any sort of conclusion , " a tribunal spokeswoman , alexandra milenov , said when asked whether milosevic had been poisoned , as his entourage has charged . " the investigations are still ongoing , " she said .
" we do n't expect a final report for a couple of days .

" he was terribly exhausted and everything was pointing toward what happened on saturday , " she told serbia 's vecernje novosti daily in an interview monday . " perhaps there were other measures which shortened his life , " she went on , adding that she had last spoken to him late friday .
" he told me , ' sleep well my darling .
i 'll call you as soon as i wake up in the morning ' . " milosevic 's legal adviser , zdenko tomanovic , said the former president had written a day before his death that he feared being poisoned .
russian officials confirmed the existence of that letter . " ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " tomanovic quoted milosevic as writing . serbian president rules out state funeral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- right -rrb- with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in belgrade on march 2 serbian president boris tadic ruled out a state funeral and said he would not pardon milosevic 's widow , meaning she would be unable to return home for any ceremony . his office said a state funeral would be " completely inappropriate because of the role he played in serbia 's recent history " as well as contrary to the wishes of the serbian people . but , as the milosevic family lawyer told afp by telephone from the hague on monday , the milosevic family decided to hold his funeral in belgrade .
it is still not clear if milosevic 's widow , who is wanted in serbia on fraud charges and currently living in russia despite an international arrest warrant , would be allowed to attend . the strongmen 's death led some supporters to gather in the rain to pay tribute to their late idol in front of his party seat in central belgrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.03.2006 former sex workers find new life caring for the aged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to get prostitutes off the street and into new careers as care workers a pilot scheme in the german state of north rhine-westphalia is retraining prostitutes as care assistants to work with the elderly . in their former profession , they were used to giving a helping hand .
now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them .

rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .

obviously , the ticket packages , which are oriented towards companies and wealthy fans , do n't come cheap . to watch four group matches , a quarter-final and the final in berlin in the very best seats , so-called sky boxes , which seat 10 to 20 people , you would have to pay between 156,000 and 336,000 euros -lrb- $ 185,700 to $ 400,000 -rrb- .
those who manage to get their hands on a highly sought-after hospitality package can watch three games for only 1,900 euros . but you 'd better hurry , because even those tickets are running out . ise paid world soccer federation fifa 175.5 million euros for the right to sell the 346,000 vip tickets for boxes and business seats in the 12 arenas where world cup will take place this summer .
experts estimate that vip seats will bring in around 500 million euros . those who pay top dollar - or euro - for the very best will be pampered with reserved parking right next to the stadium .
meanwhile , normal ticket holders will have at least three kilometers -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- to cover , either by foot or public transportation , to get to their seats .
maki n g memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vip lounge at leipzig 's zentralstadion well-heeled fans will also have their own entrance to ensure they make it into the vip area as smoothly as possible .
once they 're in , they 'll already be able to eat , drink and make merry two hours before kick-off in specially constructed hospitality tents , said peter csanadi , a spokesman for ise . they 'll have the privilege of full catering during half time as well as after the game .
around 10,000 waiters and waitresses will be on hand to serve the 346,000 customers , and 8,000 hostesses will be at their beck and call . but hospitality tent may be the wrong description for the places where the vips will while away their time , said stefan bartosch , managing director of de boer , the company that is making the constructions for the 12 stadiums . " we 're building temporary rooms , " bartosch said .
the tents are more like small cities .
" this city will be many 10,000 square meters -lrb- hundreds of thousands of square feet -rrb- in size , with its own kitchens , living rooms , with deck chairs , terraces , with everything you can imagine . " and beyond providing wealthy customers with their money 's worth , the luxurious treatment has another aim .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.03.2006 merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck has schering in its sights the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- . german pharmaceutical company merck said monday it was launching a hostile bid worth 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.4 billion -rrb- to buy berlin-based rival schering and become one of europe 's leading drug makers .
schering , a world leader in contraceptives and fertility drugs , turned down merck 's advances , saying the offer price " significantly undervalues " its business .
merck , which already holds a stake of 4.98 percent in schering , said in a statement it was making a cash offer of 77 euros per share " with the goal of combining the two companies to create a world-class pharmaceuticals and chemicals company with combined annual revenues of 11.2 billion euros . "
the offer price represented a premium of 35 percent over the average price of schering shares during the three months before merck made known its intentions and a premium of 15 percent over the closing price of schering shares last friday .
merck chairman michael roemer said a tie-up with schering would allow both companies " to take a quantum leap and become more competitive and continue to thrive in the consolidating global pharmaceuticals industry . "
same size , different niches the combined company would have a research and development budget of 1.3 billion euros , an enhanced product pipeline and the increased sales reach to launch new products in the key markets of the united states and japan , merck argued .
both schering and merck are of a similar size , but while merck specializes in generic drugs and cancer treatment via its best-selling erbitux drug , schering is a world leader in fertility drugs .
a tie-up would create economies of scale of 500 million euros each year from 2009 and it would boost earnings by more than 10 percent even without taking those synergies into account , merck said .
no objections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merck sees its way clear for a takeover ; schering 's not so sure merck said it did not expect any objections from the competition authorities .
and it had no intention of breaking up schering or selling off its own chemicals activities , especially its profitable liquid crystals business , should the merger go ahead .
the combined group would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies in germany and would rank number 14 in the world .
merck currently ranks number 22 and schering number 18 and analysts believe merck is too small to survive on its own .
roemer said he hoped merck 's management and supervisory boards would recommend that the shareholders accept the offer .
" irrespective of the management board 's recommendation , the decision to accept our offer lies with the shareholders , " he said .
" we are confident that they will consider this offer , which represents full and immediate value as attractive . "
schering feeling undervalued bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined company would be greater than the sum of its parts for its part , schering said merck 's offer " significantly undervalues schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company . "
merck 's approach was " unsolicited " and " no negotiations are ongoing with merck , " schering said .
merck said it would initially finance the deal via cash and bridge loans .
but the total sum of 14.6 billion euros " will be refinanced through a combination of existing funds , debt and equity , " it said .
merck would undertake a capital of increase of between 500 million euros and 4.0 billion euros , as well as a one-billion-euro equity contribution via the merck family .
pharmaceutical expert put in charge merck said that it had appointed karl-ludwig kley , currently chief financial officer of german flag carrier lufthansa , as its deputy chairman to oversee the integration of schering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-ludwig kley 's experience at bayer will be valuable kley was former head of corporate finance and investor relations at pharmaceuticals giant bayer , is already a member of merck 's supervisory board and a member of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , the company that oversees the 73-percent stake held by the merck family in merck kgaa .
" with his extensive background in the pharmaceuticals industry , as well as his experience in responsible positions at two leading german companies , kley is well-equipped to create a major german pharmaceuticals and chemicals company , " said the chairman of the advisory board of e. merck ohg , frank stangenberg-haverkamp . investors appeared to believe schering would become the target of a takeover battle in which the purchase price would be driven much higher . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

now , their clients are no longer paying clients but old people in need of care .
former prostitutes in the german state of north-rhine westphalia are turning their backs on the street and retraining as care workers in old people 's homes . thanks to the pilot scheme , run by a protestant organization , diakonie westfalen , and financed by the state and contributions from the european union 's social funds to the tune of one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- , more than 30 women between the ages of 20 and 40 have swapped a life in the sex industry for two years training and practical experience in the care industry . rita kühn from diakonie westfalen believes that the former prostitutes are ideally suited to dealing with the aged and the demands that are placed on those who are caring for them . " the prostitutes generally get on very well with the people , " kühn told german magazine der spiegel magazine .
" they have no reservations about any aspects of the work . " ex-prostitutes show aptitude for cari n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are dirtier jobs than cleaning for the elderly coming from an industry where intimacy with strangers is standard , kühn said the ex-prostitutes do not suffer from the stigma some may feel when dealing with the personal and physical aspects of the job such as cleaning and washing . to keep other stigmas at bay , the ex-prostitutes work in the care homes under the promise that their former professions remain secret .
rita kühn said the levels of trust needed between care-giver and an old person may be compromised by the knowledge that the assistant used to work in the sex business . retraining as a care assistant is not only a change of profession but a life-changing experience which gives many of the women back their self-esteem . gisela zohren was the star dominatrix at a sado-masochist establishment for 19 years before quitting .
now she said she feels that she has learnt a lot more about human nature , and herself , during her work with old people than she ever did brandishing chains and whips for her clients . " i have learnt to listen to people 's needs , not just their wishes , " she told der spiegel .
" i have learnt to give old people a sense of security , something that is unfortunately lacking in this day and age . " care work offers better wages tha n selli n g sex i n nrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north-rhine westphalia 's sex workers face stiff competition some of the prostitutes have not only joined the scheme to get away from the potentially dangerous and violent sex industry . with an estimated 50,000 prostitutes working in the state , the availability of sex workers has driven the price for their services down to as low as 30 euros for the full treatment .
retraining in an industry which is crying out for carer-givers and which will pay accordingly is often the main reason behind a change in career . heinz oberlach from the federal employment agency said that the pilot project can help the care industry out of its hole .
there are currently 6,400 institutions around germany which are chronically understaffed and the idea of taking sex workers off the street and filling those vacancies " are two parts of the same puzzle .

the media magnate refused to answer when state tv journalist lucia annunziata asked about his business affairs and the iraq conflict .
" you ca n't tell me what to do , " he said as the conversation descended into bickering and he accused her of bias .
" this is my show , i 'll decide the questions , " ms annunziata retorted .
she told him he was " not used to taking journalists ' questions " .
the prime minister faces his first tv debate with opposition leader romano prodi on tuesday as the race hots up for the 9-10 april election and his coalition lags behind in opinion polls by several points .
' war machine ' mr berlusconi effectively owns three private tv stations in italy while his supporters run two of the three rai , or state , tv channels . "
and they say i 'm the one who controls rai ! "
silvio berlusconi only rai tre , the least watched of the three , is critical of the prime minister and he was being interviewed on its in a half-hour programme .
after just 20 minutes , he was gathering up his papers and telling ms annunziata her programme was " a war machine set against the prime minister " .
the interviewer had asked him why he was only known abroad for his support for us president george w bush in iraq , as well as possible conflicts of commercial and political interest .
accusing her of " prejudices " and being " on the left " , he said : " you should be a little bit ashamed . "
as he left the studio , his microphone was still attached and he could be heard shouting : " and they say i 'm the one who controls rai ! "
rai tre showed the interview uncut on sunday afternoon .
correspondents note that it is rare for italian interviewers to take a confrontational approach with politicians .
while mr berlusconi dominated tv screens earlier in the year , strict campaigning laws have since taken effect , forcing the media to give equal space to italy 's many political parties and thereby reducing his exposure .

the charity action on elder abuse , which has been conducting a limited study into the problem , uncovered more than 600 cases of abuse in six months .
but only five of those ended up in court .
this morning on breakfast : graham satchell heard the disturbing story of 91 year old dorothy blackmore , who was abused by care workers in her own home .
her son installed a secret video camera because he suspected something was n't right - and recorded horrifying scenes of verbal and physical abuse .
the two carers who treated her so badly were taken to court and sentenced last week .
we talked to the government 's care services minister liam byrne .
he announced that the government will be setting up a national network of dignity guardians , to make sure that elderly and vulnerable people are treated with the respect they deserve .
we heard from the campaigner esther rantzen and nadra ahmed of the national care association .
recordings of our interviews will be available later today on this page .
the study by action on elder abuse looked at nine local authorities in england over six months .
it uncovered 639 cases of abuse in just six months .
more than half involved the elderly and two thirds of the victims were women .
just over 200 of the abuse cases took place in the person 's own home , 188 were in care homes .
most of the abuse cases in a vulnerable adult 's own home involved a paid care worker - although abuse by family members other than carers was also common .

on sunday , the people of iwakuni city voted 8-1 against bringing more planes and troops to a local us airbase .
while the vote is not binding , analysts say it could put pressure on the government 's deal .
the redeployment proposal is part of a project to streamline the us military presence in japan .
under the plans , which are currently under negotiation with washington , the around 50,000 us troops currently stationed in japan will be redistributed .
some 7,000 are set to be withdrawn from the island of okinawa , which is home to the largest us air base in the pacific , to guam .
the plan would also bring 57 more warplanes to iwakuni , currently home to some 3,000 marines .
' no change ' mr koizumi said the results of the iwakuni vote would not affect the discussions - which the government hopes to complete by the end of the month .
" there is no change , " he told reporters on monday .
" if you carry out a plebiscite anywhere , i 'm sure residents will oppose the bases .
that is what is difficult about security issues . "
protests have been held in almost all the cities likely to be given more troops .
on saturday about 2,000 residents of zama city , south of tokyo , rallied to oppose plans to increase troop numbers there .
the issue of us troops in japan is sensitive because of local worries about noise , environmental damage , and crimes committed by the military .
the country is still scarred by a case in 1995 in which three american servicemen raped a japanese schoolgirl in okinawa .

the romantic comedy , which stars sarah jessica parker and matthew mcconaughey , replaced madea 's family reunion , which fell to fifth after two weeks on top .
mcconaughey plays a 35-year-old still living with his parents , who hire an outgoing woman , played by parker , to entice him into moving out .
family movie the shaggy dog was second , with horror the hills have eyes third .
the top three films had a combined earnings of $ 56.1m -lrb- £ 32.4m -rrb- , down on the $ 64.4m -lrb- £ 37.2m -rrb- taken by the top three movies in the same weekend last year - robots , the pacifier and be cool .

metropolitan police chief sir ian blair recorded the conversation with lord goldsmith last september without him knowing , it has emerged .
lord goldsmith is said to be " rather cross " and " somewhat disappointed " .
richard barnes , a conservative member of the metropolitan police authority and the london assembly , called for sir ian to consider his position .
" he must clearly discuss this with the chairman of the police authority , and no doubt the home secretary will want to talk to him , " he said .
" but i think he has got to a stage where he must consider his own position .
the reputation of the metropolitan police really must be paramount and that is what we must protect . "
" his behaviour appears to be unconstitutional , unethical , quite possibly unlawful " liberty director shami chakrabarti send us your reaction mr barnes told bbc radio 4 's today programme he was " utterly surprised and shocked " by sir ian 's actions .
even before sir ian 's secret taping of the attorney general emerged , the home office had reportedly told him to stay out of the limelight - or risk losing downing street 's support .
but the home office minister , hazel blears , has denied she gave him " any instructions , or indeed advice , in those terms " .
" that would be entirely inappropriate for me to do that .
" this is a very serious issue , " ms blears added .
" obviously the matter will be taken seriously by the metropolitan police authority . "
the director of civil rights group liberty , shami chakrabarti , called for sir ian 's resignation and branded his actions " bizarre " .
wire tap she said : " his behaviour appears to be unconstitutional , unethical , quite possibly unlawful .
" this is covert surveillance .
it is very hard for any of us to have trust in him as the senior law enforcer ... in this country .
" he has some serious explaining to do , " she said .
the call to the attorney general - the chief legal adviser to the government - was about the admissibility of wire tap evidence in court , but it did not concern a particular case .
sir ian , who is thought to be on holiday , has been criticised previously for his handling of the aftermath of the shooting of brazilian jean charles de menezes by anti-terror police at stockwell tube station last july .

" we are surprised about the recording of calls and now have the recordings .
we are dealing with this issue . "
consent issue the spokesman added that no formal investigation into the allegations was taking place .
the recording and monitoring of telephone calls is governed by a number of different pieces of uk legislation , according to ofcom , the telephone industry regulator .
it is not illegal for individuals to tape conversations providing the recording is for their own use , under the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 -lrb- ripa -rrb- .
it is a civil , not criminal , matter if a conversation or e-mail has been recorded and shared unlawfully .
