not content with being rounder than any other soccer ball ever created , the teamgeist berlin - the official ball of the world cup final - will also be golden . in a surreal ceremony before the brandenburg gate in the german capital , the world cup host country 's own golden boy franz beckenbauer pulled a gilded cloak off a 2.2-metre diameter representation of the new ball in its first public appearance . if the glittering performance of the kaiser and the gold-painted greek warriors which flanked him were n't enough to signal the uniqueness of this particular ball , then the fact that the golden orb will only be used in the last game of this summer 's tournament , surely elevated it status beyond all expectations . golden ball " made in germany " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball for the final will be made in the host country in addition , the 15 golden balls which will be on duty during the last game of the championships will not be made abroad but in germany , the home of the finals in 2006 and the creators of the ball , adidas . " it only surprises me that no one thought of it before , " beckenbauer said .
" the final is such a special occasion for the players , the coaches and the fans around the world .
creating a special ball for this match , the most important match every four years , was a great idea . " adidas chairman herbert hainer told the assembled journalists that he could see a new tradition being born with the introduction of the teamgeist berlin concept .
" we would definitely like to see this as the start of a new tradition for the final match , " he said .
" we 'll do this again but try to come up with something special for each final . " traditional black and white balls get special touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing plain about the monochrome version no plain black and white balls from thailand for the world cup final then .
while the teamgeist berlin will have six of its 14 panels colored gold , the plain old teamgeist balls used in the 63 other matches will be in traditional monochrome . however , even these will be special .
the sets of 15 balls for each match at the tournament will for the first time have the names of the teams , venue , date and kick-off time printed on them . each of the 32 teams at the world cup will receive 40 black-and-white and 20 golden balls to practice with . adidas has provided the balls for the world cup since 1970 and has the rights until 2014 .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .

the number of contested ballots in the senate , however , was not expected to change the picture . the confirmation puts an end to days of political uncertainty in italy and clears the way for the formation of a center-left government under prodi . even in the run-up to the decision , prodi pressed ahead with preparations to take power .
he held an informal meeting on wednesday at his rome headquarters with the mayors of italy 's three largest left-controlled cities , naples , turin and rome , to discuss local government taxation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news is not good for berlusconi but the 69-year-old berlusconi and his allies showed no signs of conceding defeat before the court verdict . the prime minister has maintained an uncharacteristically low profile since a weekend statement in which he offered a power-sharing agreement with prodi , on the grounds that his coalition took almost 50 percent of the vote . but his center-right coalition warned in a statement late tuesday that lower courts may have accumulated errors in the rush to get information to the supreme court for its ballot review . court urged to investigate suspected " irregularities " mirko tremaglia , italy 's minister with responsibility for italians abroad , had insisted the court investigate " irregularities " in the foreign vote before rubber-stamping the election result .
" i 'm not doing this to destroy the whole election , but we need to have an inquiry to see if italians around the world were able to vote or not . " " this is something which the court has to take charge of . " provisional results handed a narrow victory to prodi more than a week ago , but they have been challenged by berlusconi , who demanded a review of contested votes . close run contest needs lawmakers ' decision prodi 's coalition won control of the lower house chamber of deputies by 25,224 votes , or 0.06 percent of the more than 39 million cast in the cliffhanger polls in a turnout of more than 83 percent , according to provisional results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting concerns prompt calls for an investigation the center-left also won a two-seat advantage in the senate , which was decided on a regional basis , even though it won nearly 1 percent fewer overall votes than the center-right in the contest for the upper house . berlusconi has unsuccessfully pressured prodi to begin negotiations on a limited power-sharing agreement - given that just under 50 percent of the electorate voted with the outgoing government - saying a failure to do so would lead to instability . imf calls for quick action the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- called wednesday on italy 's new government to get to work quickly to address " tremendous " problems facing one of europe 's biggest economies . imf chief economist raghuram rajan said it was still early days in italy after a knife-edge election that appears to have been won by a center-left coalition led by romano prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington , dc " but nevertheless the policy challenges facing italy are tremendous , " he told a news conference , citing the country 's high fiscal deficit and public debt . " there is an important need for both macro -lrb- economic -rrb- policy reform but also structural reforms in italy to increase the level of competitiveness across the board , " rajan said , presenting the imf 's semi-annual world economic outlook . " i am hopeful the new government will seize the policy opportunities and do far more , but of course we have to wait and see . " investors are fretting over italy 's economic direction after the election .
prime minister silvio berlusconi has refused to concede defeat , while prodi would have to manage an unwieldy coalition if he does take power . the imf official also played down speculation that italy might be forced to quit the 12-nation eurozone . " i think and i hope that there is very little chance that italy will leave the euro .
and so i think at this point it is just speculation and i do n't see the strong basis for it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy faces second week of political stalemate italy headed into a second week of uncertainty sunday with prime minister silvio berlusconi still refusing to recognize his leftist rival romano prodi 's narrow victory in last week 's general election .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .

but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .

" they are playing a brutal game with the fears of the vw employees , " works ' council head bernd osterloh said . boardroom rivalry hurting company while a decision is expected from the meeting on vw 's reorganization , the issue of whether pischetsrieder will extend his contract , which runs out next year , is less clear cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pischetsrieder 's spot in the driver 's seat is n't quite up for grabs yet internal skirmishes in the vw boardroom have weighed on the company recently as both wiedeking and wulff have called for pischetsrieder 's contract to be extended soon , while supervisory board chairman ferdinand piëch called the extension an " open question .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address .

" i am happy to be able to announce to you today that germany has changed its viewpoint and will agree to a fast revision of the -lrb- 1955 -rrb- bonn agreements " which govern the handling of the vast archive of 30 million records , zypries said . under the supervision of 11 nations since the war , access to the archive , based in bad arolsen , germany , has been restricted mainly to the international committee of the red cross , which has used it to help people trace their relatives . but historians and the general public have been barred from access , with germany reportedly the main force in recent years blocking the archive 's opening on privacy grounds . a final decision on opening the archive will be made at the annual meeting of the 11 countries overseeing it on may 17 in luxembourg . the decision could see the release of digital copies of the documents to repositories managed by the 11 countries . " this archive will have immense historical significance and will be a terrific boon for scholars for several generations , " bloomfield said . meticulous nazi documentation to be revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive includes files on death camp inmates the archive , known formally as the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- , comprises meticulous nazi documentation of death camp inmates , conscription workers and others .
the records were seized by the allied forces after the german regime fell in 1945 ; they also include postwar records the allies kept on resettling refugees . they have been central to people searching for loved ones after world war ii , especially for jews whose relatives were sent to nazi concentration camps , where many millions died . they have also been used to help people who were victims of nazi forced labor programs seek indemnification under international agreements made after the war . the its still receives hundreds of thousands of inquiries each year about people possibly mentioned in the records . researchers and historians of the holocaust have been especially critical of the policy to restrict access to the its , arguing the documents would help complete a picture of the nazi slaughter of millions of jews . german opposition based on possible misuse of information in 1998 the its commission declared itself unanimously in favor of opening up the records , and began scanning the documents into digital form the next year . according to holocaust museum historian paul shapiro , about half of the its collection has been digitized . but germany and some others had continued to resist the opening , holding that the records involve private information about individuals that could be misused . the 1955 bonn agreement requires the its to ensure that no data is published that could harm the former nazi victims or their families . according to the its website , the documents contain " information about hereditary diseases , pseudo-medical experiments , categories of reasons for arrest ... illegitimate children , etc . " personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .
" our point of view is that the protection of privacy rights has reached by now a standard high enough to ensure ... the protection of privacy of those concerned , " zypries said . gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims against germany lauded the decision . " these records have been awaited for years by holocaust survivors and scholars of this terrible period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 attack turns spotlight on right-wing extremism in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people protested in potsdam against racism and violence in the wake of a racially motivated murder attempt in the city of potsdam , experts are concerned about the increasing aggressiveness of the far-right scene despite reassuring statistics on the actual number of crimes . the latest victim of racist violence in germany - a 37-year-old german engineer of ethiopian descent - is still fighting for his life .
he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident . " we still feel considerable pressure from the ultra-right scene , " said kahane , who is researching the relocation of right-extremist attacks from rural to urban areas .
" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident .

" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

not content with being rounder than any other soccer ball ever created , the teamgeist berlin - the official ball of the world cup final - will also be golden . in a surreal ceremony before the brandenburg gate in the german capital , the world cup host country 's own golden boy franz beckenbauer pulled a gilded cloak off a 2.2-metre diameter representation of the new ball in its first public appearance . if the glittering performance of the kaiser and the gold-painted greek warriors which flanked him were n't enough to signal the uniqueness of this particular ball , then the fact that the golden orb will only be used in the last game of this summer 's tournament , surely elevated it status beyond all expectations . golden ball " made in germany " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball for the final will be made in the host country in addition , the 15 golden balls which will be on duty during the last game of the championships will not be made abroad but in germany , the home of the finals in 2006 and the creators of the ball , adidas . " it only surprises me that no one thought of it before , " beckenbauer said .
" the final is such a special occasion for the players , the coaches and the fans around the world .
creating a special ball for this match , the most important match every four years , was a great idea . " adidas chairman herbert hainer told the assembled journalists that he could see a new tradition being born with the introduction of the teamgeist berlin concept .
" we would definitely like to see this as the start of a new tradition for the final match , " he said .
" we 'll do this again but try to come up with something special for each final . " traditional black and white balls get special touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing plain about the monochrome version no plain black and white balls from thailand for the world cup final then .
while the teamgeist berlin will have six of its 14 panels colored gold , the plain old teamgeist balls used in the 63 other matches will be in traditional monochrome . however , even these will be special .
the sets of 15 balls for each match at the tournament will for the first time have the names of the teams , venue , date and kick-off time printed on them . each of the 32 teams at the world cup will receive 40 black-and-white and 20 golden balls to practice with . adidas has provided the balls for the world cup since 1970 and has the rights until 2014 .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident . " we still feel considerable pressure from the ultra-right scene , " said kahane , who is researching the relocation of right-extremist attacks from rural to urban areas .
" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action . " casey said burns and representatives of the other five countries spoke for more than three hours over dinner and agreed that iran had " crossed the line " laid out by the international community . " everyone agreed on the need to find the diplomatic means to get iran back into compliance with its international obligations and they also agreed on the need for further discussions of how to do that in the un security council , " casey said . iran as a nuclear military power " unacceptable " washington made clear ahead of the moscow meeting that it would continue to seek early and muscular action by the un security council .
on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he would not rule out a military strike to halt the program . " all options are on the table " concerning iran , bush told reporters at the white house .
however , he said a diplomatic solution was the goal .
" and we 're working hard to do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this capsule of uranium hexaflouride gas can be used to produce nuclear material russia has repeated its position that neither sanctions nor military force would resolve the iran nuclear impasse . french president jacques chirac told egyptian daily al-ahram wednesday that it was " unacceptable " for iran to have nuclear weapons .
but he left the door open to resumed discussions with tehran . the iranian leaders " must understand that , for the international community , the prospect of a militarily nuclear iran is unacceptable , " chirac said in an interview published as he was due to arrive in egypt on a two-day visit . iran continues its stance in tehran , president mahmoud ahmadinejad warned that iran 's army was like a " meteorite " that would destroy any attacking force . " it will cut off the hand of any aggressor and leave the enemy covered in shame , " ahmadinejad said tuesday . the moscow talks come after ahmadinejad last week announced that the islamic state had successfully enriched a small amount of uranium for use as fuel for a nuclear power station . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran ' ready for war , ' but seeks peace : envoy as the five permanent members of the un security council and germany prepare to meet in moscow for talks over iran 's nuclear program tuesday , teheran 's top envoy to russia issued a strongly-worded message .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action . " casey said burns and representatives of the other five countries spoke for more than three hours over dinner and agreed that iran had " crossed the line " laid out by the international community . " everyone agreed on the need to find the diplomatic means to get iran back into compliance with its international obligations and they also agreed on the need for further discussions of how to do that in the un security council , " casey said . iran as a nuclear military power " unacceptable " washington made clear ahead of the moscow meeting that it would continue to seek early and muscular action by the un security council .
on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he would not rule out a military strike to halt the program . " all options are on the table " concerning iran , bush told reporters at the white house .
however , he said a diplomatic solution was the goal .
" and we 're working hard to do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this capsule of uranium hexaflouride gas can be used to produce nuclear material russia has repeated its position that neither sanctions nor military force would resolve the iran nuclear impasse . french president jacques chirac told egyptian daily al-ahram wednesday that it was " unacceptable " for iran to have nuclear weapons .
but he left the door open to resumed discussions with tehran . the iranian leaders " must understand that , for the international community , the prospect of a militarily nuclear iran is unacceptable , " chirac said in an interview published as he was due to arrive in egypt on a two-day visit . iran continues its stance in tehran , president mahmoud ahmadinejad warned that iran 's army was like a " meteorite " that would destroy any attacking force . " it will cut off the hand of any aggressor and leave the enemy covered in shame , " ahmadinejad said tuesday . the moscow talks come after ahmadinejad last week announced that the islamic state had successfully enriched a small amount of uranium for use as fuel for a nuclear power station . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran ' ready for war , ' but seeks peace : envoy as the five permanent members of the un security council and germany prepare to meet in moscow for talks over iran 's nuclear program tuesday , teheran 's top envoy to russia issued a strongly-worded message .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .

but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 attack turns spotlight on right-wing extremism in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people protested in potsdam against racism and violence in the wake of a racially motivated murder attempt in the city of potsdam , experts are concerned about the increasing aggressiveness of the far-right scene despite reassuring statistics on the actual number of crimes . the latest victim of racist violence in germany - a 37-year-old german engineer of ethiopian descent - is still fighting for his life .
he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident . " we still feel considerable pressure from the ultra-right scene , " said kahane , who is researching the relocation of right-extremist attacks from rural to urban areas .
" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action . " casey said burns and representatives of the other five countries spoke for more than three hours over dinner and agreed that iran had " crossed the line " laid out by the international community . " everyone agreed on the need to find the diplomatic means to get iran back into compliance with its international obligations and they also agreed on the need for further discussions of how to do that in the un security council , " casey said . iran as a nuclear military power " unacceptable " washington made clear ahead of the moscow meeting that it would continue to seek early and muscular action by the un security council .
on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he would not rule out a military strike to halt the program . " all options are on the table " concerning iran , bush told reporters at the white house .
however , he said a diplomatic solution was the goal .
" and we 're working hard to do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this capsule of uranium hexaflouride gas can be used to produce nuclear material russia has repeated its position that neither sanctions nor military force would resolve the iran nuclear impasse . french president jacques chirac told egyptian daily al-ahram wednesday that it was " unacceptable " for iran to have nuclear weapons .
but he left the door open to resumed discussions with tehran . the iranian leaders " must understand that , for the international community , the prospect of a militarily nuclear iran is unacceptable , " chirac said in an interview published as he was due to arrive in egypt on a two-day visit . iran continues its stance in tehran , president mahmoud ahmadinejad warned that iran 's army was like a " meteorite " that would destroy any attacking force . " it will cut off the hand of any aggressor and leave the enemy covered in shame , " ahmadinejad said tuesday . the moscow talks come after ahmadinejad last week announced that the islamic state had successfully enriched a small amount of uranium for use as fuel for a nuclear power station . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran ' ready for war , ' but seeks peace : envoy as the five permanent members of the un security council and germany prepare to meet in moscow for talks over iran 's nuclear program tuesday , teheran 's top envoy to russia issued a strongly-worded message .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action . " casey said burns and representatives of the other five countries spoke for more than three hours over dinner and agreed that iran had " crossed the line " laid out by the international community . " everyone agreed on the need to find the diplomatic means to get iran back into compliance with its international obligations and they also agreed on the need for further discussions of how to do that in the un security council , " casey said . iran as a nuclear military power " unacceptable " washington made clear ahead of the moscow meeting that it would continue to seek early and muscular action by the un security council .
on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he would not rule out a military strike to halt the program . " all options are on the table " concerning iran , bush told reporters at the white house .
however , he said a diplomatic solution was the goal .
" and we 're working hard to do so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this capsule of uranium hexaflouride gas can be used to produce nuclear material russia has repeated its position that neither sanctions nor military force would resolve the iran nuclear impasse . french president jacques chirac told egyptian daily al-ahram wednesday that it was " unacceptable " for iran to have nuclear weapons .
but he left the door open to resumed discussions with tehran . the iranian leaders " must understand that , for the international community , the prospect of a militarily nuclear iran is unacceptable , " chirac said in an interview published as he was due to arrive in egypt on a two-day visit . iran continues its stance in tehran , president mahmoud ahmadinejad warned that iran 's army was like a " meteorite " that would destroy any attacking force . " it will cut off the hand of any aggressor and leave the enemy covered in shame , " ahmadinejad said tuesday . the moscow talks come after ahmadinejad last week announced that the islamic state had successfully enriched a small amount of uranium for use as fuel for a nuclear power station . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran ' ready for war , ' but seeks peace : envoy as the five permanent members of the un security council and germany prepare to meet in moscow for talks over iran 's nuclear program tuesday , teheran 's top envoy to russia issued a strongly-worded message .

" personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .
" our point of view is that the protection of privacy rights has reached by now a standard high enough to ensure ... the protection of privacy of those concerned , " zypries said . gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims against germany lauded the decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria opinion : a calculated risk pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " the pope as pop star in bavaria gay rights activists stage protest ahead of pope visit germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has successfully shed his stern image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .
bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope .
-lrb- april 19 , 2005 -rrb- benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own .
-lrb- july 30 , 2005 -rrb- new pope delights and disappoints around the world , presidents and religious leaders have hailed joseph ratzinger 's election as pope benedict xvi .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .

" they are playing a brutal game with the fears of the vw employees , " works ' council head bernd osterloh said . boardroom rivalry hurting company while a decision is expected from the meeting on vw 's reorganization , the issue of whether pischetsrieder will extend his contract , which runs out next year , is less clear cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pischetsrieder 's spot in the driver 's seat is n't quite up for grabs yet internal skirmishes in the vw boardroom have weighed on the company recently as both wiedeking and wulff have called for pischetsrieder 's contract to be extended soon , while supervisory board chairman ferdinand piëch called the extension an " open question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2006 court gives prodi green light to govern italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi 's celebrations last week were not misplaced italy 's supreme court formally confirmed the electoral victory of center-left leader romano prodi in the lower house in one of the country 's closest elections in living memory . italy 's high court , the court of cassation , said prodi had won the lower house by a margin of some 24,000 votes against premier silvio berlusconi 's conservatives - a margin almost identical to the one previously announced . berlusconi won the popular vote for the senate , but prodi gained a two-seat majority due to a complicated system of bonuses .
the number of contested ballots in the senate , however , was not expected to change the picture . the confirmation puts an end to days of political uncertainty in italy and clears the way for the formation of a center-left government under prodi . even in the run-up to the decision , prodi pressed ahead with preparations to take power .
he held an informal meeting on wednesday at his rome headquarters with the mayors of italy 's three largest left-controlled cities , naples , turin and rome , to discuss local government taxation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news is not good for berlusconi but the 69-year-old berlusconi and his allies showed no signs of conceding defeat before the court verdict . the prime minister has maintained an uncharacteristically low profile since a weekend statement in which he offered a power-sharing agreement with prodi , on the grounds that his coalition took almost 50 percent of the vote . but his center-right coalition warned in a statement late tuesday that lower courts may have accumulated errors in the rush to get information to the supreme court for its ballot review . court urged to investigate suspected " irregularities " mirko tremaglia , italy 's minister with responsibility for italians abroad , had insisted the court investigate " irregularities " in the foreign vote before rubber-stamping the election result .
" i 'm not doing this to destroy the whole election , but we need to have an inquiry to see if italians around the world were able to vote or not . " " this is something which the court has to take charge of . " provisional results handed a narrow victory to prodi more than a week ago , but they have been challenged by berlusconi , who demanded a review of contested votes . close run contest needs lawmakers ' decision prodi 's coalition won control of the lower house chamber of deputies by 25,224 votes , or 0.06 percent of the more than 39 million cast in the cliffhanger polls in a turnout of more than 83 percent , according to provisional results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting concerns prompt calls for an investigation the center-left also won a two-seat advantage in the senate , which was decided on a regional basis , even though it won nearly 1 percent fewer overall votes than the center-right in the contest for the upper house . berlusconi has unsuccessfully pressured prodi to begin negotiations on a limited power-sharing agreement - given that just under 50 percent of the electorate voted with the outgoing government - saying a failure to do so would lead to instability . imf calls for quick action the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- called wednesday on italy 's new government to get to work quickly to address " tremendous " problems facing one of europe 's biggest economies . imf chief economist raghuram rajan said it was still early days in italy after a knife-edge election that appears to have been won by a center-left coalition led by romano prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington , dc " but nevertheless the policy challenges facing italy are tremendous , " he told a news conference , citing the country 's high fiscal deficit and public debt .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address .

not content with being rounder than any other soccer ball ever created , the teamgeist berlin - the official ball of the world cup final - will also be golden . in a surreal ceremony before the brandenburg gate in the german capital , the world cup host country 's own golden boy franz beckenbauer pulled a gilded cloak off a 2.2-metre diameter representation of the new ball in its first public appearance . if the glittering performance of the kaiser and the gold-painted greek warriors which flanked him were n't enough to signal the uniqueness of this particular ball , then the fact that the golden orb will only be used in the last game of this summer 's tournament , surely elevated it status beyond all expectations . golden ball " made in germany " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball for the final will be made in the host country in addition , the 15 golden balls which will be on duty during the last game of the championships will not be made abroad but in germany , the home of the finals in 2006 and the creators of the ball , adidas . " it only surprises me that no one thought of it before , " beckenbauer said .
" the final is such a special occasion for the players , the coaches and the fans around the world .
creating a special ball for this match , the most important match every four years , was a great idea . " adidas chairman herbert hainer told the assembled journalists that he could see a new tradition being born with the introduction of the teamgeist berlin concept .
" we would definitely like to see this as the start of a new tradition for the final match , " he said .

while the teamgeist berlin will have six of its 14 panels colored gold , the plain old teamgeist balls used in the 63 other matches will be in traditional monochrome . however , even these will be special .
the sets of 15 balls for each match at the tournament will for the first time have the names of the teams , venue , date and kick-off time printed on them . each of the 32 teams at the world cup will receive 40 black-and-white and 20 golden balls to practice with . adidas has provided the balls for the world cup since 1970 and has the rights until 2014 .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident . " we still feel considerable pressure from the ultra-right scene , " said kahane , who is researching the relocation of right-extremist attacks from rural to urban areas .
" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .
bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope .
-lrb- april 19 , 2005 -rrb- benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own .
-lrb- july 30 , 2005 -rrb- new pope delights and disappoints around the world , presidents and religious leaders have hailed joseph ratzinger 's election as pope benedict xvi .

at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .

" the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .

" islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .
the car giant 's home city of wolfsburg would be hardest hit as 10 percent of the workforce there would be cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is exactly sure how many strings vw is hanging by " if we do n't solve the problems now , the entire company will be in danger , " bernhard said in defence of the measures . his plans may also call for vw to close its 5,000-employee plant in brussels and transfer production to germany , where a number of factories are operating under capacity . chief shareholders indicate approval bleeding red ink in both the united states and china , vw last year was barely able to surpass the break-even point while audi , one of its subsidiaries , continues to deliver record results . bernd pischetsrieder , head of vw 's board of directors , has said he wants to lower the company 's costs by 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.3 billion -rrb- while boosting pre-tax profits to 5.1 billion euros . german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research in gelsenkirchen , said available capacity at vw makes the company an excellent candidate for restructuring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria opinion : a calculated risk pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " the pope as pop star in bavaria gay rights activists stage protest ahead of pope visit germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has successfully shed his stern image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .
bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope .
-lrb- april 19 , 2005 -rrb- benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own .
-lrb- july 30 , 2005 -rrb- new pope delights and disappoints around the world , presidents and religious leaders have hailed joseph ratzinger 's election as pope benedict xvi .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .
bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope .
-lrb- april 19 , 2005 -rrb- benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own .
-lrb- july 30 , 2005 -rrb- new pope delights and disappoints around the world , presidents and religious leaders have hailed joseph ratzinger 's election as pope benedict xvi .
but liberals among the faithful fear the new pontiff will bring little reform .

" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities .

a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .

" i am happy to be able to announce to you today that germany has changed its viewpoint and will agree to a fast revision of the -lrb- 1955 -rrb- bonn agreements " which govern the handling of the vast archive of 30 million records , zypries said . under the supervision of 11 nations since the war , access to the archive , based in bad arolsen , germany , has been restricted mainly to the international committee of the red cross , which has used it to help people trace their relatives . but historians and the general public have been barred from access , with germany reportedly the main force in recent years blocking the archive 's opening on privacy grounds . a final decision on opening the archive will be made at the annual meeting of the 11 countries overseeing it on may 17 in luxembourg . the decision could see the release of digital copies of the documents to repositories managed by the 11 countries .

" personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .
" our point of view is that the protection of privacy rights has reached by now a standard high enough to ensure ... the protection of privacy of those concerned , " zypries said . gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims against germany lauded the decision . " these records have been awaited for years by holocaust survivors and scholars of this terrible period .

" i am happy to be able to announce to you today that germany has changed its viewpoint and will agree to a fast revision of the -lrb- 1955 -rrb- bonn agreements " which govern the handling of the vast archive of 30 million records , zypries said . under the supervision of 11 nations since the war , access to the archive , based in bad arolsen , germany , has been restricted mainly to the international committee of the red cross , which has used it to help people trace their relatives . but historians and the general public have been barred from access , with germany reportedly the main force in recent years blocking the archive 's opening on privacy grounds . a final decision on opening the archive will be made at the annual meeting of the 11 countries overseeing it on may 17 in luxembourg . the decision could see the release of digital copies of the documents to repositories managed by the 11 countries . " this archive will have immense historical significance and will be a terrific boon for scholars for several generations , " bloomfield said . meticulous nazi documentation to be revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive includes files on death camp inmates the archive , known formally as the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- , comprises meticulous nazi documentation of death camp inmates , conscription workers and others .
the records were seized by the allied forces after the german regime fell in 1945 ; they also include postwar records the allies kept on resettling refugees . they have been central to people searching for loved ones after world war ii , especially for jews whose relatives were sent to nazi concentration camps , where many millions died . they have also been used to help people who were victims of nazi forced labor programs seek indemnification under international agreements made after the war . the its still receives hundreds of thousands of inquiries each year about people possibly mentioned in the records . researchers and historians of the holocaust have been especially critical of the policy to restrict access to the its , arguing the documents would help complete a picture of the nazi slaughter of millions of jews . german opposition based on possible misuse of information in 1998 the its commission declared itself unanimously in favor of opening up the records , and began scanning the documents into digital form the next year . according to holocaust museum historian paul shapiro , about half of the its collection has been digitized . but germany and some others had continued to resist the opening , holding that the records involve private information about individuals that could be misused . the 1955 bonn agreement requires the its to ensure that no data is published that could harm the former nazi victims or their families . according to the its website , the documents contain " information about hereditary diseases , pseudo-medical experiments , categories of reasons for arrest ... illegitimate children , etc . " personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .
" our point of view is that the protection of privacy rights has reached by now a standard high enough to ensure ... the protection of privacy of those concerned , " zypries said . gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims against germany lauded the decision .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action .

not content with being rounder than any other soccer ball ever created , the teamgeist berlin - the official ball of the world cup final - will also be golden . in a surreal ceremony before the brandenburg gate in the german capital , the world cup host country 's own golden boy franz beckenbauer pulled a gilded cloak off a 2.2-metre diameter representation of the new ball in its first public appearance . if the glittering performance of the kaiser and the gold-painted greek warriors which flanked him were n't enough to signal the uniqueness of this particular ball , then the fact that the golden orb will only be used in the last game of this summer 's tournament , surely elevated it status beyond all expectations . golden ball " made in germany " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball for the final will be made in the host country in addition , the 15 golden balls which will be on duty during the last game of the championships will not be made abroad but in germany , the home of the finals in 2006 and the creators of the ball , adidas .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident .

the number of contested ballots in the senate , however , was not expected to change the picture . the confirmation puts an end to days of political uncertainty in italy and clears the way for the formation of a center-left government under prodi . even in the run-up to the decision , prodi pressed ahead with preparations to take power .
he held an informal meeting on wednesday at his rome headquarters with the mayors of italy 's three largest left-controlled cities , naples , turin and rome , to discuss local government taxation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news is not good for berlusconi but the 69-year-old berlusconi and his allies showed no signs of conceding defeat before the court verdict . the prime minister has maintained an uncharacteristically low profile since a weekend statement in which he offered a power-sharing agreement with prodi , on the grounds that his coalition took almost 50 percent of the vote . but his center-right coalition warned in a statement late tuesday that lower courts may have accumulated errors in the rush to get information to the supreme court for its ballot review . court urged to investigate suspected " irregularities " mirko tremaglia , italy 's minister with responsibility for italians abroad , had insisted the court investigate " irregularities " in the foreign vote before rubber-stamping the election result .
" i 'm not doing this to destroy the whole election , but we need to have an inquiry to see if italians around the world were able to vote or not . " " this is something which the court has to take charge of . " provisional results handed a narrow victory to prodi more than a week ago , but they have been challenged by berlusconi , who demanded a review of contested votes . close run contest needs lawmakers ' decision prodi 's coalition won control of the lower house chamber of deputies by 25,224 votes , or 0.06 percent of the more than 39 million cast in the cliffhanger polls in a turnout of more than 83 percent , according to provisional results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting concerns prompt calls for an investigation the center-left also won a two-seat advantage in the senate , which was decided on a regional basis , even though it won nearly 1 percent fewer overall votes than the center-right in the contest for the upper house . berlusconi has unsuccessfully pressured prodi to begin negotiations on a limited power-sharing agreement - given that just under 50 percent of the electorate voted with the outgoing government - saying a failure to do so would lead to instability . imf calls for quick action the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- called wednesday on italy 's new government to get to work quickly to address " tremendous " problems facing one of europe 's biggest economies . imf chief economist raghuram rajan said it was still early days in italy after a knife-edge election that appears to have been won by a center-left coalition led by romano prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington , dc " but nevertheless the policy challenges facing italy are tremendous , " he told a news conference , citing the country 's high fiscal deficit and public debt . " there is an important need for both macro -lrb- economic -rrb- policy reform but also structural reforms in italy to increase the level of competitiveness across the board , " rajan said , presenting the imf 's semi-annual world economic outlook . " i am hopeful the new government will seize the policy opportunities and do far more , but of course we have to wait and see . " investors are fretting over italy 's economic direction after the election .
prime minister silvio berlusconi has refused to concede defeat , while prodi would have to manage an unwieldy coalition if he does take power . the imf official also played down speculation that italy might be forced to quit the 12-nation eurozone . " i think and i hope that there is very little chance that italy will leave the euro .
and so i think at this point it is just speculation and i do n't see the strong basis for it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy faces second week of political stalemate italy headed into a second week of uncertainty sunday with prime minister silvio berlusconi still refusing to recognize his leftist rival romano prodi 's narrow victory in last week 's general election .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .

but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 germany to allow opening of huge holocaust archive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military documents as well as personal accounts from the holocaust will be accessible germany agreed tuesday to support opening a massive trove of world war ii records on 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime , after six decades of highly restricted access . german justice minister brigitte zypries announced the decision in washington after meeting with sara bloomfield , the director of the us holocaust museum . " i am happy to be able to announce to you today that germany has changed its viewpoint and will agree to a fast revision of the -lrb- 1955 -rrb- bonn agreements " which govern the handling of the vast archive of 30 million records , zypries said . under the supervision of 11 nations since the war , access to the archive , based in bad arolsen , germany , has been restricted mainly to the international committee of the red cross , which has used it to help people trace their relatives . but historians and the general public have been barred from access , with germany reportedly the main force in recent years blocking the archive 's opening on privacy grounds . a final decision on opening the archive will be made at the annual meeting of the 11 countries overseeing it on may 17 in luxembourg . the decision could see the release of digital copies of the documents to repositories managed by the 11 countries . " this archive will have immense historical significance and will be a terrific boon for scholars for several generations , " bloomfield said . meticulous nazi documentation to be revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive includes files on death camp inmates the archive , known formally as the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- , comprises meticulous nazi documentation of death camp inmates , conscription workers and others .
the records were seized by the allied forces after the german regime fell in 1945 ; they also include postwar records the allies kept on resettling refugees . they have been central to people searching for loved ones after world war ii , especially for jews whose relatives were sent to nazi concentration camps , where many millions died . they have also been used to help people who were victims of nazi forced labor programs seek indemnification under international agreements made after the war . the its still receives hundreds of thousands of inquiries each year about people possibly mentioned in the records . researchers and historians of the holocaust have been especially critical of the policy to restrict access to the its , arguing the documents would help complete a picture of the nazi slaughter of millions of jews . german opposition based on possible misuse of information in 1998 the its commission declared itself unanimously in favor of opening up the records , and began scanning the documents into digital form the next year . according to holocaust museum historian paul shapiro , about half of the its collection has been digitized . but germany and some others had continued to resist the opening , holding that the records involve private information about individuals that could be misused . the 1955 bonn agreement requires the its to ensure that no data is published that could harm the former nazi victims or their families . according to the its website , the documents contain " information about hereditary diseases , pseudo-medical experiments , categories of reasons for arrest ... illegitimate children , etc . " personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .

a new reorganization plan could eliminate 20,000 jobs at europe 's biggest carmaker . the new plan , created by supervisory board chairman wolfgang bernhard , calls for vw 's german workers to return to a 35-hour work week without a pay increase as a way of lowering personnel costs , the german newsmagazine focus reported . for the past 12 years , vw employees have worked 28.8 hours a week . the planned job cuts , which would be made through lay-offs and early retirement options , would make 20 percent of vw 's germany-based workers redundant .

" they are playing a brutal game with the fears of the vw employees , " works ' council head bernd osterloh said . boardroom rivalry hurting company while a decision is expected from the meeting on vw 's reorganization , the issue of whether pischetsrieder will extend his contract , which runs out next year , is less clear cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pischetsrieder 's spot in the driver 's seat is n't quite up for grabs yet internal skirmishes in the vw boardroom have weighed on the company recently as both wiedeking and wulff have called for pischetsrieder 's contract to be extended soon , while supervisory board chairman ferdinand piëch called the extension an " open question . " " the power struggle between piëch and pischetsrieder puts vw in a catastrophic position , " dudenhöffer told dw-tv .

he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 attack turns spotlight on right-wing extremism in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people protested in potsdam against racism and violence in the wake of a racially motivated murder attempt in the city of potsdam , experts are concerned about the increasing aggressiveness of the far-right scene despite reassuring statistics on the actual number of crimes . the latest victim of racist violence in germany - a 37-year-old german engineer of ethiopian descent - is still fighting for his life .
he was assaulted on easter morning at a bus stop in potsdam , a city in the eastern german state of brandenburg , near berlin .
at least two unidentified perpetrators had repeatedly kicked the victim in the head and attacked him verbally as well , using words such as " nigger " and " pig . "
germany 's federal state prosecutor began investigating the case on tuesday . after making publicly available the recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants , the police authorities in potsdam have received a number of clues regarding the attackers ' identity . a police spokesperson said on wednesday , however , that no breakthrough had been made yet . the news of the murder attempt with an allegedly racial background has made headlines all over the country .
hundreds of potsdamers took to the streets to demonstrate against the far-right , while potsdam 's police chief described the attack as the worse xenophobic assault in the city since germany 's reunification in 1990 . open threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the crime according to anetta kahane , chairperson of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin - an organization named after an angolan man murdered in 1990 by skinheads in brandenburg - the assault in potsdam should not be treated as an isolated incident . " we still feel considerable pressure from the ultra-right scene , " said kahane , who is researching the relocation of right-extremist attacks from rural to urban areas .
" i can only explain that as an attempt to make people living in cities feel insecure . " mario peucker of the european forum for migration studies at the university of bamberg say he 's also noticed a new kind of vehemence on the part of the far right . " they do n't hide so much anymore , they now openly threaten to disrupt things , " peucker said .
an anti-nazi concert by singer konstantin wecker , for example , was cancelled in march after protests by the radical right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- in the german state of saxony-anhalt . statistics versus violence peucker confirmed that criminal acts by the radical right have been on the rise in recent years , above all in the realm of the so-called propaganda offenses such as flaunting illegal nazi symbols .
but the actual number of violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists has remained constant . " the violence is increasingly directed against leftist groups , while the number of xenophobic violent acts is actually decreasing , " peucker said , stressing the positive influence of federal programs to combat right-wing extremism , which have cost the german government more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 183 million -rrb- in the last five years . three kinds of extremism , one basic attitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists demonstrated in berlin in march while there are no plans to cut back the funding for these programs , the german ministry of family affairs is currently planning to extend its support to projects fighting left-wing extremism and radical islam in the future as well . " the extension should not happen at the expense of combating violence on the right , " said gabriele fograscher , an expert on the far-right scene and social democratic member of the german parliament .
" the case in potsdam is another example of how acute the problem is . " kristina köhler , member of the parliament for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said , on the other hand , that fighting extremism must be seen in a holistic way . " islamic extremism is a huge problem in the west , " said köhler , who was herself threatened in 2004 , after she pressed charges against a turkish newspaper in germany for denying the holocaust . " there are new , innovative approaches that tell us that we should no longer focus on certain strains of extremism , but rather work towards pushing one basic , liberal and democratic attitude .

the search for a diplomatic solution is on the top of the agenda . senior diplomats from germany and the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , china , russia and france - come together in moscow again on wednesday , hoping to iron out their differences over how to impose controls on iran 's nuclear program .
canada and italy will also join the talks . the countries fear iran could use a nuclear energy program to mask a nuclear weapons drive , though tehran says its program is strictly for producing nuclear energy . the representatives met for a working dinner at a russian foreign ministry residence late tuesday .
russian officials said the meeting was private and offered no details .
but interfax news agency quoted a source close to the talks as saying that " no breakthrough decisions were made during the meeting . " the need for a diplomatic solution in washington , state department acting spokesman tom casey said the us representative , undersecretary of state nicholas burns , discussed " the need for some form of sanctions " on iran at the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top diplomats already met in berlin last month to discuss iran " certainly this is an issue where there will be continued discussion , " casey said .
asked if this meant no agreement was reached , he said the meeting was not intended " to reach decisions on a specific course of action . " casey said burns and representatives of the other five countries spoke for more than three hours over dinner and agreed that iran had " crossed the line " laid out by the international community . " everyone agreed on the need to find the diplomatic means to get iran back into compliance with its international obligations and they also agreed on the need for further discussions of how to do that in the un security council , " casey said . iran as a nuclear military power " unacceptable " washington made clear ahead of the moscow meeting that it would continue to seek early and muscular action by the un security council .
on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he would not rule out a military strike to halt the program . " all options are on the table " concerning iran , bush told reporters at the white house .
however , he said a diplomatic solution was the goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria dw-world : opinion : a calculated risk dw-world : pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " dw-world : the pope as pop star in bavaria dw-world : gay rights activists stage protest ahead of pope visit germany -pipe- 19.04.2006 pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has successfully shed his stern image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address .

"
now , some critics have changed their tune . the announcement that cardinal joseph ratzinger was to become the next pope caused cheers of joy to erupt from the crowd of faithful pilgrims gathered in st. peter 's square one year ago . in germany , too , the news inspired a sense of awe and pride that a countryman should be elected to lead catholics around the world .
but at the same time , germany 's large community of reform-oriented catholics shuddered .
they predicted that ratzinger , with his reputation as a hardline conservative , would catapult the church back to the middle ages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal joseph ratzinger greets the faithful on april 19 2005 many also said that the new pontiff would fail to connect with catholic communities around the world .
his stern manner would alienate him especially from young catholics , a much-needed demographic that had so successfully been courted by his predecessor , john paul ii . " we 're the pope ! " " oh my god " read the headline of the leftist german newspaper , tageszeitung .
in contrast , the popular german taboid bild jubilantly proclaimed " we 're the pope ! " a year on , reactions to pope benedict xvi are no longer so extreme .
even organizations that at first habitually criticized his every move have begun according him respect . the liberal swiss theologian hans küng , who was among ratzinger 's most vocal critics , now finds he has something positive to say about the man he 's known since they worked together at the second vatican council in 1962-1965 . " up to now , the worst fears have not been realized , " küng told reuters .
" he has found another style . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict delighted young pilgrims who traveled to cologne for world youth day last year contrary to the " rottweiler " image that was so pervasive before his election , ratzinger 's initial appearances as pope were marked with a charming humility .
demonstrating that he does not shy away from his critics , ratzinger held an audience with küng shortly after he became pope . " there are not two ratzingers , he has stayed the same person but what has changed is his role , " küng said .
" he no longer has to control the teaching and censor the teachers .
now he is responsible for spreading the christian message in the church and in the world . " watching and waiting still , küng expressed hope that after his first year in office , benedict would move forward with reforms . " he has obeyed the roman saying ' primo anno oculus ' - in the first year , keep an open eye .
he has watched things cautiously .
i hope that , in the second year , he moves forward and undertakes reforms .
now he should act with a strong hand . " germany 's reformist national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , however , was more guarded in its assessment .
pope benedict may not have turned out to be the " catastrophe " predicted a year ago , but many of the group 's fears have been confirmed , managing director bernd göhring told dw-world.de. " it 's good , for example , that he places such emphasis on reaching out to young people , " he said .
" however , i question how this is being implemented .
youth work is not just about praying and singing , it 's about educating young people to be tolerant and respectful . " similarly , göhring commended benedict 's work on creating dialogue with the orthodox churches , but said he wished he " would do the same with the protestant churches . " on the issues of the role of women in the church and the church 's treatment of gays and lesbians , the pope has " confirmed our worst fears , " göhring said . german cardinals satisfied german cardinals have expressed satisfaction with benedict 's performance during his first year as pope . " he 's brought peace to the catholic church , " cardinal walter kasper told public broadcaster ard .
" john paul ii exaggerated many things - he had too many cardinals , too many saints , too many documents , too many activities . " benedict has brought things back to a more normal level , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say pope benedict has revived the catholic church in his home state of bavaria the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , echoed remarks he made a year ago when he lauded the fact that , 60 years after the end of world war ii , a german could be pope .
a year on , he said this had been good for germany . " i have the impression that respect towards us germans has grown a bit , " lehmann told ard .
" i said once before that we had a false image of ratzinger .
he is much more sensitive and sophisticated , and it was clear to me that , should he become pope , he would enjoy having other duties and other issues to address .

" i am happy to be able to announce to you today that germany has changed its viewpoint and will agree to a fast revision of the -lrb- 1955 -rrb- bonn agreements " which govern the handling of the vast archive of 30 million records , zypries said . under the supervision of 11 nations since the war , access to the archive , based in bad arolsen , germany , has been restricted mainly to the international committee of the red cross , which has used it to help people trace their relatives . but historians and the general public have been barred from access , with germany reportedly the main force in recent years blocking the archive 's opening on privacy grounds . a final decision on opening the archive will be made at the annual meeting of the 11 countries overseeing it on may 17 in luxembourg . the decision could see the release of digital copies of the documents to repositories managed by the 11 countries . " this archive will have immense historical significance and will be a terrific boon for scholars for several generations , " bloomfield said . meticulous nazi documentation to be revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive includes files on death camp inmates the archive , known formally as the international tracing service -lrb- its -rrb- , comprises meticulous nazi documentation of death camp inmates , conscription workers and others .
the records were seized by the allied forces after the german regime fell in 1945 ; they also include postwar records the allies kept on resettling refugees . they have been central to people searching for loved ones after world war ii , especially for jews whose relatives were sent to nazi concentration camps , where many millions died . they have also been used to help people who were victims of nazi forced labor programs seek indemnification under international agreements made after the war . the its still receives hundreds of thousands of inquiries each year about people possibly mentioned in the records . researchers and historians of the holocaust have been especially critical of the policy to restrict access to the its , arguing the documents would help complete a picture of the nazi slaughter of millions of jews . german opposition based on possible misuse of information in 1998 the its commission declared itself unanimously in favor of opening up the records , and began scanning the documents into digital form the next year . according to holocaust museum historian paul shapiro , about half of the its collection has been digitized . but germany and some others had continued to resist the opening , holding that the records involve private information about individuals that could be misused . the 1955 bonn agreement requires the its to ensure that no data is published that could harm the former nazi victims or their families . according to the its website , the documents contain " information about hereditary diseases , pseudo-medical experiments , categories of reasons for arrest ... illegitimate children , etc . " personal testimonies important for understanding and learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries : germany is confident information wo n't be abused zypries said tuesday that germany had now changed its position after gaining confidence that personal records would not be abused .
" our point of view is that the protection of privacy rights has reached by now a standard high enough to ensure ... the protection of privacy of those concerned , " zypries said . gideon taylor of the conference on jewish material claims against germany lauded the decision . " these records have been awaited for years by holocaust survivors and scholars of this terrible period .

mr hu will also visit boeing 's offices - both microsoft and boeing have recently signed large commercial agreements with chinese counterparts .
mr hu told the governor of washington state , chris gregoire , that he had chosen to visit seattle because the state had " very good cooperative relations " with china .

he emphasised china 's commitment to action against software piracy . "
china seems to be saying the right things " robert zoellick , us deputy secretary of state q & a : hu jintao 's us visit send us your comments " china is focused on and has already accomplished much in creating and enforcing laws to protect intellectual property , " he said .
he had dinner with mr gates at his home on tuesday evening .
currency pressure the issue of trade relations between the us and china is expected to dominate the visit .
washington has blamed china for its spiralling trade deficit - which rose to a record $ 202bn last year .
it says beijing has deliberately suppressed the value of its currency , making its exports more competitive in global markets .
sino-us trade facts the us had a $ 202bn trade deficit with china in 2005 the us is china 's second largest trade partner while the china is the us ' fourth largest market many us politicians want strong action unless china revalues the yuan .
last year , washington slapped import curbs on chinese textile imports .
a vocal group of us senators has threatened penalties on a wider range of goods unless china lets the yuan trade more freely against the dollar .
beijing - which raised the yuan 's value against the dollar by 2 % last year - has denied claims of currency manipulation .
it says us firms should focus more on developing products suitable for the chinese market .
the two countries recently signed $ 4bn in bilateral trade deals and hope to foster greater co-operation in key industrial sectors such as energy , transport and software .
' slow ' progress us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick said the two sides had made progress on narrowing their trade differences but progress was far slower than he would like .
" china seems to be saying the right things , " mr zoellick - a former us trade representative - said ahead of mr hu 's visit .
" but the process of change seems agonisingly slow . "
chinese officials said economic and commercial co-operation was crucial to building " sustainable and healthy " relations between the two nations .
however , a chinese foreign policy expert said the us was principally to blame for the uneven trading status between the two .
" the fact that the us has consistently allowed its domestic politics and its ideological prejudice against china ... to supersede fairness is what prevents a speedy solution to the trade frictions , " said yuan peng , from the china institute of contemporary international relations .
despite growing tensions , sino-us trade has grown by an average of 27 % a year over the past four years .

mr hu arrived in seattle on tuesday for a tour of washington state before talks on thursday with the us president .
his high-profile tour comes as anger grows in the us about the size of its trade deficit with china .
mr hu will also visit boeing 's offices - both microsoft and boeing have recently signed large commercial agreements with chinese counterparts .
mr hu told the governor of washington state , chris gregoire , that he had chosen to visit seattle because the state had " very good cooperative relations " with china .
he said the tour of the microsoft campus " left a strong impression " on him and he praised the company for its innovation .
he emphasised china 's commitment to action against software piracy .
china seems to be saying the right things robert zoellick , us deputy secretary of state q & a : hu jintao 's us visit send us your comments " china is focused on and has already accomplished much in creating and enforcing laws to protect intellectual property , " he said .
he had dinner with mr gates at his home on tuesday evening .
currency pressure the issue of trade relations between the us and china is expected to dominate the visit .
washington has blamed china for its spiralling trade deficit - which rose to a record $ 202bn last year .
it says beijing has deliberately suppressed the value of its currency , making its exports more competitive in global markets .
sino-us trade facts the us had a $ 202bn trade deficit with china in 2005 the us is china 's second largest trade partner while the china is the us ' fourth largest market many us politicians want strong action unless china revalues the yuan .
last year , washington slapped import curbs on chinese textile imports .
a vocal group of us senators has threatened penalties on a wider range of goods unless china lets the yuan trade more freely against the dollar .
beijing - which raised the yuan 's value against the dollar by 2 % last year - has denied claims of currency manipulation .
it says us firms should focus more on developing products suitable for the chinese market .
the two countries recently signed $ 4bn in bilateral trade deals and hope to foster greater co-operation in key industrial sectors such as energy , transport and software .
' slow ' progress us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick said the two sides had made progress on narrowing their trade differences but progress was far slower than he would like .
" china seems to be saying the right things , " mr zoellick - a former us trade representative - said ahead of mr hu 's visit .
" but the process of change seems agonisingly slow . "
chinese officials said economic and commercial co-operation was crucial to building " sustainable and healthy " relations between the two nations .
however , a chinese foreign policy expert said the us was principally to blame for the uneven trading status between the two .
" the fact that the us has consistently allowed its domestic politics and its ideological prejudice against china ... to supersede fairness is what prevents a speedy solution to the trade frictions , " said yuan peng , from the china institute of contemporary international relations .
despite growing tensions , sino-us trade has grown by an average of 27 % a year over the past four years .

jackson , who has lived in the middle east since being acquitted of child abuse charges , is expected to release the new record next year .
the 47-year-old said he is " incredibly excited " about the new project .
guy holmes , chairman of uk label gut records , is expected to manage the album 's production and look after jackson 's business interests .
charity record jackson has struck the deal with a member of the bahraini royal family abdulla hamad al-khalifa , according to a statement from the two seas record company .
mr holmes , who has been named manager of the new venture , is planning to divide his time between london and bahrain .
" i am enjoying being back in the studio making music , " added jackson , whose last album release was invincible in 2001 .
jackson 's us spokeswoman , raymone bain , said she was not aware of the agreement , but added that his charity record for hurricane katrina had been released on the two seas label .
a deal with a major label to distribute the album has yet to be announced .
jackson 's deal with epic , a label belonging to sony bmg , recently expired .

the company , which also owns clothing chain primark , has warned of further falls in the second half of the year .
ab said costs would " continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the uk sugar business , our bakery operations and energy costs " .
while the group 's revenue rose by 10 % , adjusted pre-tax profits fell to £ 225m in the same period .
new sugar regime " as expected , british sugar has experienced price pressure , but it is well positioned for the medium term and we remain confident about its prospects , " said george weston , chief executive of associated british foods .
the price squeeze follows the eu 's final proposals to bring its sugar trading rules into line with world markets from 2009 .
the eu has agreed to reduce the subsidies it pays to its sugar producers in the face of criticism from the world trade organization and pressure groups .
at the same time , least developed countries -lrb- ldcs -rrb- will be allowed to sell sugar to eu countries without being subjected to quotas or tariffs .
the company said the changes and continued imbalances in supply and demand could be expected to " affect the profit of british sugar during the transition period " .
sugar accounts for a fifth of ab food profits .
as a result , the company is looking for cheaper raw sugar outside the eu and is considering bidding for africa 's biggest sugar producer , illovo .
it has also reduced the importance of sugar within the company 's portfolio in recent years and instead is focusing on other food businesses and primark .
clothing sales primark 's like-for-like sales went up by 6 % in this period , despite a fire at its warehouse before christmas .

brit producer and director michael winterbottom - of 24 hour party people and 9 songs fame - has a new production planned based on the events surrounding the controversial dismissal by mr straw of the ambassador to uzbekistan craig murray .
mr murray , you may recall , was removed amid claims he had been targeted for criticising uk policy towards the country which ignored its human rights abuses .
mr winterbottom has already pencilled steve ' alan partridge ' coogan in for the role of the diplomat whose yet-to-be published book , murder in samarkand , forms the basis of the planned film .
mr straw refuses to be drawn but fellow mps have their own suggestions and , if you ask me , the foreign secretary has nothing to be ashamed of .
so far suggestions to mr straw 's local newspaper have included al pacino , from tory nigel evans , who said the actor possessed the same " do n't mess with me " quality that he reckons mr straw has recently adopted .
labour 's gordon prentice suggested derek jacobi on the grounds it would take a consummate actor to play a man of as many parts as mr straw .
and labour 's greg pope called on bill nighy to step forward as he " might act as a better foreign secretary than jack " .
as for mr murray himself , he is less flattering , suggesting the man who sacked him should be portrayed by alan rickman - the actor who once pulled off the formidable task of making the sheriff of nottingham appear more evil that ever before .
however , this may all prove pointless .
government officials are set to take legal action to stop both the book and film on the grounds it was a " betrayal of trust " to produce the book which , it was claimed , is " misleading and incorrect " .
" we will actively consider our legal options if mr murray publishes his book , " said a spokesman .
ok , but what if al pacino agrees to play the foreign secretary then ? 1530 gmt , tuesday 28 march we all know what it 's like .
you live in the same house for donkeys ' years and eventually the stuffing falls out of the sofa , the mattresses sag and the kids break your favourite coffee table .
all part of the wear and tear of daily living - requiring a trip to the local furniture shop and a raid on the credit card .
but £ 30,000 in one year ?
that is what tony and cherie blair spent on furnishings in 10 downing street in 2004-5 .
and it was n't a one off .
in the previous five years they spent just short of £ 100,000 on furnishings - and you can get a lot of new coffee tables for that sort of money .
the figures have been obtained by liberal democrat mp norman baker who intends to investigate further to discover precisely what the cash was spent on .
" i 've been in downing street and the furniture looks perfectly alright to me .
it seems the prime minister is very cavalier when it comes to spending other people 's money to keep himself in comfort , " he said .
1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1030 gmt , tuesday 21 march the labour party may already have money worries over the possible repayment of its secret £ 14million loans from wealthy businessmen - but there may be worse to come .
some party members are kicking up at the whacking 50 % increase in their subs from £ 24 to £ 36 which , they fear , is to help cover the debts .
i am told that many are already refusing to pay the increase and there are fears in party hq that the latest affair is only going to make matters worse .
and , with membership currently less than half what it was at the 1997 election , there is little optimism within the ranks that a recruitment drive will have much effect .
perhaps an appeal for donations might help ...
1300 gmt , tuesday 14 march this must mark the official start of a battle of the bearskins .
labour 's chris mullin tabled a commons motion asking for the traditional hats , worn by five guards regiments and royalty , including prince phillip , to be banned and replaced with fake fur alternatives to spare the bear .
now former scots guard soldier and bearskin wearer , tory mp ben wallace has hit back , insisting the hats should continue to be made from the real thing - and warning that to scrap them would threaten the livelihoods of the canadian inuit -lrb- eskimos -rrb- .
stressing the hats highlighted the regiment 's " glorious military traditions " he added : " the bearskin pelts used for them are sourced from a necessary cull of canadian bears carried out by the indigenous inuit people every year . "
and , in his amendment to mr mullin 's motion , he adds : " previous trials of artificial fur have failed to find an appropriate replacement and many bearskins last for many decades especially after the grooming that guardsmen are required to administer to them . " 1300 gmt , monday 13 march the long-running and often controversial issue of a commons crèche has started doing the rounds again , with many women mps once again asking why there is no such facility in the palace of westminster , particularly when all the parties are out to attract more women into the place .
at one recent meeting , for example , labour 's ann cryer acidly remarked : " no room for a crèche , but if i remember correctly there is a smoking room . "
there is an unhappy history attached to this issue and previous , unsuccessful attempts to provide a crèche .
the official reason for the inaction has always been the lack of a suitable site for the facility .
in the past the old rifle range where gun totin ' mps and security staff used to practice their skills was suggested and then ruled out .
it was always said the cellar , claimed to be the one in which guy fawkes was discovered -lrb- maybe -rrb- , was inappropriate .
but ms cryer may have an idea .
after all , the commons authorities have signalled they intend to extend the existing ban on smoking to cover the entire palace when the government 's new anti-smoking laws come into effect mind you they would probably need to have the place professionally fumigated before opening it up to babes in arms .
1730 gmt , wednesday 8 march ming " the merciless " campbell has just reshuffled the lib dem frontbench and appears to have abolished the shadow cabinet post of minister for women .
that may well reflect the fact the tony blair 's minister meg munn is doing the job without pay so ming plans to match like with like .
but on international women 's day .
is n't that bad timing ?
not at all , insist the leader 's office .
ming does not believe in making women a special case but wants them to have full shadow cabinet portfolios and , as a result , has doubled to four the number in the top team .
he also intends to ensure women get new help and opportunities to become mps and progress through the ranks via the party 's gender balance task force .
meanwhile , after sacking tom brake as transport spokesman , sir menzies still left him to face transport questions in the commons later in the day .
ming the merciless indeed .
1230 gmt , tuesday 7 march new lib dem boss ming campbell is desperate to shrug off any suggestion he is a short-term , stop-gap leader .
for example , he teased his harrogate conference with a little joke about the last ming dynasty lasting 276 years .
but there may be at least one sign that he is not expecting to stay quite that long after all .
during the election campaign he was questioned over climate change and his attachment to his old gas guzzling , 5.3 litre v12 jaguar xjs car .
with a clear sense of regret , he declared everyone had to make sacrifices for the environment and the old girl would have to go .
however , it appears he apparently ca n't bring himself to actually pension the motor off but is keeping it in a barn at his home .
for future use perhaps ? 1300 gmt , monday 6 march one of westminster 's great historic institutions is to be abolished .
not the house of lords or the office of speaker , it 's far more important than that .
bean counters in the palace of westminster , backed by a committee of mps , have decided that annie 's bar - probably the most famous of the dozen or so watering holes in this place - should bring down its shutters for good .
apparently the only bar in the palace where journalists and politicians can meet on an equal footing just does n't make enough money , so a review of catering facilities has concluded it must go .
annie 's may not draw the crowds it used to in the recent past but that is put down to new labour banning mps from setting foot in the place and its recent relocation to what looks like an old coal cellar .
but it still offers the only place where mps and journalists can meet each other without being at the grace and favour of one or other of them .
its annual pool contest , supported by sports minister richard caborn and dozens of mps , also raises large sums for charity .
annie 's used to be an essential part of the workings of westminster , particularly in the days of minority governments and periods when events in the commons actually mattered .
to add insult to injury , the authorities also suggested there was no need for a closing party .
think again .
1730 gmt , friday 3 march tessa jowell may be on tenterhooks over what the weekend newspapers have in store for her in the latest chapter on her husband 's business dealings .
and tony blair may even be wondering what sort of reception his decision to clear his friend and colleague will have in the coming days .
but cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell is clearly something less than stressed out over his role in the affair .
once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .
1000 gmt , thursday 2 march his wife tessa jowell may have been feeling a little happier this morning but david mills was definitely having a bad car day .
he left his house to be greeted by the traditional scrum of photographers , cameramen and reporters and shouts about his business dealings .
to the confusion of all he said " check this out " and added the italian word " strumentalizzazione " , which apparently translates as manipulation .
then he drove off in his silver bmw , running over the foot of a cameraman before smashing his wing mirror into the same unfortunate cameraman 's open rear car door .
" i wonder who 's going to pay for that then ? " he asked - in english .
good question .
1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .
the annual national school essay writing competition organised by the press gallery drew more than 300 entries from around the country .
and here is what the judges said about one of the winners , 16 year old christopher rigby , from wigan and his essay entitled parliament and government - spot the difference . " he begins by quoting french philosophers and uses classic references to illustrate his point .
" he could probably give an interesting lecture on the subject , even suggesting the idea of reducing the size of the electorate by forcing voters to undergo a political intelligence test to earn their vote - but he rejects this as extreme " .
indeed , that would probably rule out most mps and political journalists .
the other overall winner , 14 year old thomas-neil hogg from winchester college along with the 15 regional winners were treated to a tour of westminster and lunch in the commons before visiting downing street to meet the prime minister .
tony blair , i am reliably informed , already has his eye on a couple of potential successors .
i do n't know .
young people these days .

however , this may all prove pointless .
government officials are set to take legal action to stop both the book and film on the grounds it was a " betrayal of trust " to produce the book which , it was claimed , is " misleading and incorrect " .
" we will actively consider our legal options if mr murray publishes his book , " said a spokesman .
ok , but what if al pacino agrees to play the foreign secretary then ? 1530 gmt , tuesday 28 march we all know what it 's like .
you live in the same house for donkeys ' years and eventually the stuffing falls out of the sofa , the mattresses sag and the kids break your favourite coffee table .
all part of the wear and tear of daily living - requiring a trip to the local furniture shop and a raid on the credit card .
but £ 30,000 in one year ?
that is what tony and cherie blair spent on furnishings in 10 downing street in 2004-5 .
and it was n't a one off .
in the previous five years they spent just short of £ 100,000 on furnishings - and you can get a lot of new coffee tables for that sort of money .
the figures have been obtained by liberal democrat mp norman baker who intends to investigate further to discover precisely what the cash was spent on .
" i 've been in downing street and the furniture looks perfectly alright to me .
it seems the prime minister is very cavalier when it comes to spending other people 's money to keep himself in comfort , " he said .
1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
willis wants marsh banned from schools celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1030 gmt , tuesday 21 march the labour party may already have money worries over the possible repayment of its secret £ 14million loans from wealthy businessmen - but there may be worse to come .
some party members are kicking up at the whacking 50 % increase in their subs from £ 24 to £ 36 which , they fear , is to help cover the debts .
i am told that many are already refusing to pay the increase and there are fears in party hq that the latest affair is only going to make matters worse .
and , with membership currently less than half what it was at the 1997 election , there is little optimism within the ranks that a recruitment drive will have much effect .
perhaps an appeal for donations might help ...
1300 gmt , tuesday 14 march this must mark the official start of a battle of the bearskins .
prince phillip is a bearskin wearer labour 's chris mullin tabled a commons motion asking for the traditional hats , worn by five guards regiments and royalty , including prince phillip , to be banned and replaced with fake fur alternatives to spare the bear .
now former scots guard soldier and bearskin wearer , tory mp ben wallace has hit back , insisting the hats should continue to be made from the real thing - and warning that to scrap them would threaten the livelihoods of the canadian inuit -lrb- eskimos -rrb- .
stressing the hats highlighted the regiment 's " glorious military traditions " he added : " the bearskin pelts used for them are sourced from a necessary cull of canadian bears carried out by the indigenous inuit people every year . "
and , in his amendment to mr mullin 's motion , he adds : " previous trials of artificial fur have failed to find an appropriate replacement and many bearskins last for many decades especially after the grooming that guardsmen are required to administer to them . " 1300 gmt , monday 13 march the long-running and often controversial issue of a commons crèche has started doing the rounds again , with many women mps once again asking why there is no such facility in the palace of westminster , particularly when all the parties are out to attract more women into the place .
finding room for children at one recent meeting , for example , labour 's ann cryer acidly remarked : " no room for a crèche , but if i remember correctly there is a smoking room . "
there is an unhappy history attached to this issue and previous , unsuccessful attempts to provide a crèche .
the official reason for the inaction has always been the lack of a suitable site for the facility .
in the past the old rifle range where gun totin ' mps and security staff used to practice their skills was suggested and then ruled out .
it was always said the cellar , claimed to be the one in which guy fawkes was discovered -lrb- maybe -rrb- , was inappropriate .
but ms cryer may have an idea .
after all , the commons authorities have signalled they intend to extend the existing ban on smoking to cover the entire palace when the government 's new anti-smoking laws come into effect mind you they would probably need to have the place professionally fumigated before opening it up to babes in arms .
1730 gmt , wednesday 8 march ming " the merciless " campbell has just reshuffled the lib dem frontbench and appears to have abolished the shadow cabinet post of minister for women .
that may well reflect the fact the tony blair 's minister meg munn is doing the job without pay so ming plans to match like with like .
but on international women 's day .
is n't that bad timing ?
not at all , insist the leader 's office .
ming does not believe in making women a special case but wants them to have full shadow cabinet portfolios and , as a result , has doubled to four the number in the top team .
he also intends to ensure women get new help and opportunities to become mps and progress through the ranks via the party 's gender balance task force .
meanwhile , after sacking tom brake as transport spokesman , sir menzies still left him to face transport questions in the commons later in the day .
ming the merciless indeed .
1230 gmt , tuesday 7 march new lib dem boss ming campbell is desperate to shrug off any suggestion he is a short-term , stop-gap leader .
for example , he teased his harrogate conference with a little joke about the last ming dynasty lasting 276 years .
but there may be at least one sign that he is not expecting to stay quite that long after all .
during the election campaign he was questioned over climate change and his attachment to his old gas guzzling , 5.3 litre v12 jaguar xjs car .
with a clear sense of regret , he declared everyone had to make sacrifices for the environment and the old girl would have to go .
however , it appears he apparently ca n't bring himself to actually pension the motor off but is keeping it in a barn at his home .
for future use perhaps ? 1300 gmt , monday 6 march one of westminster 's great historic institutions is to be abolished .
caborn supports pool contest not the house of lords or the office of speaker , it 's far more important than that .
bean counters in the palace of westminster , backed by a committee of mps , have decided that annie 's bar - probably the most famous of the dozen or so watering holes in this place - should bring down its shutters for good .
apparently the only bar in the palace where journalists and politicians can meet on an equal footing just does n't make enough money , so a review of catering facilities has concluded it must go .
annie 's may not draw the crowds it used to in the recent past but that is put down to new labour banning mps from setting foot in the place and its recent relocation to what looks like an old coal cellar .
but it still offers the only place where mps and journalists can meet each other without being at the grace and favour of one or other of them .
its annual pool contest , supported by sports minister richard caborn and dozens of mps , also raises large sums for charity .
annie 's used to be an essential part of the workings of westminster , particularly in the days of minority governments and periods when events in the commons actually mattered .
to add insult to injury , the authorities also suggested there was no need for a closing party .
think again .
1730 gmt , friday 3 march tessa jowell may be on tenterhooks over what the weekend newspapers have in store for her in the latest chapter on her husband 's business dealings .
and tony blair may even be wondering what sort of reception his decision to clear his friend and colleague will have in the coming days .
but cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell is clearly something less than stressed out over his role in the affair .
once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .
1000 gmt , thursday 2 march his wife tessa jowell may have been feeling a little happier this morning but david mills was definitely having a bad car day .
he left his house to be greeted by the traditional scrum of photographers , cameramen and reporters and shouts about his business dealings .
to the confusion of all he said " check this out " and added the italian word " strumentalizzazione " , which apparently translates as manipulation .
then he drove off in his silver bmw , running over the foot of a cameraman before smashing his wing mirror into the same unfortunate cameraman 's open rear car door .
" i wonder who 's going to pay for that then ? " he asked - in english .
good question .
1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .
the annual national school essay writing competition organised by the press gallery drew more than 300 entries from around the country .
and here is what the judges said about one of the winners , 16 year old christopher rigby , from wigan and his essay entitled parliament and government - spot the difference . " he begins by quoting french philosophers and uses classic references to illustrate his point .
" he could probably give an interesting lecture on the subject , even suggesting the idea of reducing the size of the electorate by forcing voters to undergo a political intelligence test to earn their vote - but he rejects this as extreme " .
indeed , that would probably rule out most mps and political journalists .
the other overall winner , 14 year old thomas-neil hogg from winchester college along with the 15 regional winners were treated to a tour of westminster and lunch in the commons before visiting downing street to meet the prime minister .
tony blair , i am reliably informed , already has his eye on a couple of potential successors .
i do n't know .
young people these days .

is film fame awaiting our foreign secretary ?
brit producer and director michael winterbottom - of 24 hour party people and 9 songs fame - has a new production planned based on the events surrounding the controversial dismissal by mr straw of the ambassador to uzbekistan craig murray .
mr murray , you may recall , was removed amid claims he had been targeted for criticising uk policy towards the country which ignored its human rights abuses .
mr winterbottom has already pencilled steve ' alan partridge ' coogan in for the role of the diplomat whose yet-to-be published book , murder in samarkand , forms the basis of the planned film .
mr straw refuses to be drawn but fellow mps have their own suggestions and , if you ask me , the foreign secretary has nothing to be ashamed of .
so far suggestions to mr straw 's local newspaper have included al pacino , from tory nigel evans , who said the actor possessed the same " do n't mess with me " quality that he reckons mr straw has recently adopted .
labour 's gordon prentice suggested derek jacobi on the grounds it would take a consummate actor to play a man of as many parts as mr straw .
and labour 's greg pope called on bill nighy to step forward as he " might act as a better foreign secretary than jack " .
as for mr murray himself , he is less flattering , suggesting the man who sacked him should be portrayed by alan rickman - the actor who once pulled off the formidable task of making the sheriff of nottingham appear more evil that ever before .

finding room for children at one recent meeting , for example , labour 's ann cryer acidly remarked : " no room for a crèche , but if i remember correctly there is a smoking room . "
there is an unhappy history attached to this issue and previous , unsuccessful attempts to provide a crèche .
the official reason for the inaction has always been the lack of a suitable site for the facility .
in the past the old rifle range where gun totin ' mps and security staff used to practice their skills was suggested and then ruled out .
it was always said the cellar , claimed to be the one in which guy fawkes was discovered -lrb- maybe -rrb- , was inappropriate .
but ms cryer may have an idea .
after all , the commons authorities have signalled they intend to extend the existing ban on smoking to cover the entire palace when the government 's new anti-smoking laws come into effect mind you they would probably need to have the place professionally fumigated before opening it up to babes in arms .
1730 gmt , wednesday 8 march ming " the merciless " campbell has just reshuffled the lib dem frontbench and appears to have abolished the shadow cabinet post of minister for women .
that may well reflect the fact the tony blair 's minister meg munn is doing the job without pay so ming plans to match like with like .
but on international women 's day .
is n't that bad timing ?
not at all , insist the leader 's office .
ming does not believe in making women a special case but wants them to have full shadow cabinet portfolios and , as a result , has doubled to four the number in the top team .
he also intends to ensure women get new help and opportunities to become mps and progress through the ranks via the party 's gender balance task force .
meanwhile , after sacking tom brake as transport spokesman , sir menzies still left him to face transport questions in the commons later in the day .
ming the merciless indeed .
1230 gmt , tuesday 7 march new lib dem boss ming campbell is desperate to shrug off any suggestion he is a short-term , stop-gap leader .
for example , he teased his harrogate conference with a little joke about the last ming dynasty lasting 276 years .
but there may be at least one sign that he is not expecting to stay quite that long after all .
during the election campaign he was questioned over climate change and his attachment to his old gas guzzling , 5.3 litre v12 jaguar xjs car .
with a clear sense of regret , he declared everyone had to make sacrifices for the environment and the old girl would have to go .
however , it appears he apparently ca n't bring himself to actually pension the motor off but is keeping it in a barn at his home .
for future use perhaps ? 1300 gmt , monday 6 march one of westminster 's great historic institutions is to be abolished .
caborn supports pool contest not the house of lords or the office of speaker , it 's far more important than that .
bean counters in the palace of westminster , backed by a committee of mps , have decided that annie 's bar - probably the most famous of the dozen or so watering holes in this place - should bring down its shutters for good .
apparently the only bar in the palace where journalists and politicians can meet on an equal footing just does n't make enough money , so a review of catering facilities has concluded it must go .
annie 's may not draw the crowds it used to in the recent past but that is put down to new labour banning mps from setting foot in the place and its recent relocation to what looks like an old coal cellar .
but it still offers the only place where mps and journalists can meet each other without being at the grace and favour of one or other of them .
its annual pool contest , supported by sports minister richard caborn and dozens of mps , also raises large sums for charity .
annie 's used to be an essential part of the workings of westminster , particularly in the days of minority governments and periods when events in the commons actually mattered .
to add insult to injury , the authorities also suggested there was no need for a closing party .
think again .
1730 gmt , friday 3 march tessa jowell may be on tenterhooks over what the weekend newspapers have in store for her in the latest chapter on her husband 's business dealings .
and tony blair may even be wondering what sort of reception his decision to clear his friend and colleague will have in the coming days .
but cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell is clearly something less than stressed out over his role in the affair .
once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .
1000 gmt , thursday 2 march his wife tessa jowell may have been feeling a little happier this morning but david mills was definitely having a bad car day .
he left his house to be greeted by the traditional scrum of photographers , cameramen and reporters and shouts about his business dealings .
to the confusion of all he said " check this out " and added the italian word " strumentalizzazione " , which apparently translates as manipulation .
then he drove off in his silver bmw , running over the foot of a cameraman before smashing his wing mirror into the same unfortunate cameraman 's open rear car door .
" i wonder who 's going to pay for that then ? " he asked - in english .
good question .
1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .
the annual national school essay writing competition organised by the press gallery drew more than 300 entries from around the country .
and here is what the judges said about one of the winners , 16 year old christopher rigby , from wigan and his essay entitled parliament and government - spot the difference . " he begins by quoting french philosophers and uses classic references to illustrate his point .
" he could probably give an interesting lecture on the subject , even suggesting the idea of reducing the size of the electorate by forcing voters to undergo a political intelligence test to earn their vote - but he rejects this as extreme " .
indeed , that would probably rule out most mps and political journalists .
the other overall winner , 14 year old thomas-neil hogg from winchester college along with the 15 regional winners were treated to a tour of westminster and lunch in the commons before visiting downing street to meet the prime minister .
tony blair , i am reliably informed , already has his eye on a couple of potential successors .
i do n't know .
young people these days .

is film fame awaiting our foreign secretary ?
brit producer and director michael winterbottom - of 24 hour party people and 9 songs fame - has a new production planned based on the events surrounding the controversial dismissal by mr straw of the ambassador to uzbekistan craig murray .
mr murray , you may recall , was removed amid claims he had been targeted for criticising uk policy towards the country which ignored its human rights abuses .
mr winterbottom has already pencilled steve ' alan partridge ' coogan in for the role of the diplomat whose yet-to-be published book , murder in samarkand , forms the basis of the planned film .
mr straw refuses to be drawn but fellow mps have their own suggestions and , if you ask me , the foreign secretary has nothing to be ashamed of .
so far suggestions to mr straw 's local newspaper have included al pacino , from tory nigel evans , who said the actor possessed the same " do n't mess with me " quality that he reckons mr straw has recently adopted .
labour 's gordon prentice suggested derek jacobi on the grounds it would take a consummate actor to play a man of as many parts as mr straw .
and labour 's greg pope called on bill nighy to step forward as he " might act as a better foreign secretary than jack " .
as for mr murray himself , he is less flattering , suggesting the man who sacked him should be portrayed by alan rickman - the actor who once pulled off the formidable task of making the sheriff of nottingham appear more evil that ever before .
however , this may all prove pointless .
government officials are set to take legal action to stop both the book and film on the grounds it was a " betrayal of trust " to produce the book which , it was claimed , is " misleading and incorrect " .
" we will actively consider our legal options if mr murray publishes his book , " said a spokesman .
ok , but what if al pacino agrees to play the foreign secretary then ? 1530 gmt , tuesday 28 march we all know what it 's like .
you live in the same house for donkeys ' years and eventually the stuffing falls out of the sofa , the mattresses sag and the kids break your favourite coffee table .
all part of the wear and tear of daily living - requiring a trip to the local furniture shop and a raid on the credit card .
but £ 30,000 in one year ?
that is what tony and cherie blair spent on furnishings in 10 downing street in 2004-5 .
and it was n't a one off .
in the previous five years they spent just short of £ 100,000 on furnishings - and you can get a lot of new coffee tables for that sort of money .
the figures have been obtained by liberal democrat mp norman baker who intends to investigate further to discover precisely what the cash was spent on .
" i 've been in downing street and the furniture looks perfectly alright to me .
it seems the prime minister is very cavalier when it comes to spending other people 's money to keep himself in comfort , " he said .
1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
willis wants marsh banned from schools celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1030 gmt , tuesday 21 march the labour party may already have money worries over the possible repayment of its secret £ 14million loans from wealthy businessmen - but there may be worse to come .
some party members are kicking up at the whacking 50 % increase in their subs from £ 24 to £ 36 which , they fear , is to help cover the debts .
i am told that many are already refusing to pay the increase and there are fears in party hq that the latest affair is only going to make matters worse .
and , with membership currently less than half what it was at the 1997 election , there is little optimism within the ranks that a recruitment drive will have much effect .
perhaps an appeal for donations might help ...
1300 gmt , tuesday 14 march this must mark the official start of a battle of the bearskins .
prince phillip is a bearskin wearer labour 's chris mullin tabled a commons motion asking for the traditional hats , worn by five guards regiments and royalty , including prince phillip , to be banned and replaced with fake fur alternatives to spare the bear .
now former scots guard soldier and bearskin wearer , tory mp ben wallace has hit back , insisting the hats should continue to be made from the real thing - and warning that to scrap them would threaten the livelihoods of the canadian inuit -lrb- eskimos -rrb- .
stressing the hats highlighted the regiment 's " glorious military traditions " he added : " the bearskin pelts used for them are sourced from a necessary cull of canadian bears carried out by the indigenous inuit people every year . "
and , in his amendment to mr mullin 's motion , he adds : " previous trials of artificial fur have failed to find an appropriate replacement and many bearskins last for many decades especially after the grooming that guardsmen are required to administer to them . " 1300 gmt , monday 13 march the long-running and often controversial issue of a commons crèche has started doing the rounds again , with many women mps once again asking why there is no such facility in the palace of westminster , particularly when all the parties are out to attract more women into the place .

once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .
1000 gmt , thursday 2 march his wife tessa jowell may have been feeling a little happier this morning but david mills was definitely having a bad car day .
he left his house to be greeted by the traditional scrum of photographers , cameramen and reporters and shouts about his business dealings .
to the confusion of all he said " check this out " and added the italian word " strumentalizzazione " , which apparently translates as manipulation .
then he drove off in his silver bmw , running over the foot of a cameraman before smashing his wing mirror into the same unfortunate cameraman 's open rear car door .
" i wonder who 's going to pay for that then ? " he asked - in english .
good question .
1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .

the other overall winner , 14 year old thomas-neil hogg from winchester college along with the 15 regional winners were treated to a tour of westminster and lunch in the commons before visiting downing street to meet the prime minister .
tony blair , i am reliably informed , already has his eye on a couple of potential successors .
i do n't know .

is film fame awaiting our foreign secretary ?
brit producer and director michael winterbottom - of 24 hour party people and 9 songs fame - has a new production planned based on the events surrounding the controversial dismissal by mr straw of the ambassador to uzbekistan craig murray .
mr murray , you may recall , was removed amid claims he had been targeted for criticising uk policy towards the country which ignored its human rights abuses .
mr winterbottom has already pencilled steve ' alan partridge ' coogan in for the role of the diplomat whose yet-to-be published book , murder in samarkand , forms the basis of the planned film .
mr straw refuses to be drawn but fellow mps have their own suggestions and , if you ask me , the foreign secretary has nothing to be ashamed of .
so far suggestions to mr straw 's local newspaper have included al pacino , from tory nigel evans , who said the actor possessed the same " do n't mess with me " quality that he reckons mr straw has recently adopted .
labour 's gordon prentice suggested derek jacobi on the grounds it would take a consummate actor to play a man of as many parts as mr straw .
and labour 's greg pope called on bill nighy to step forward as he " might act as a better foreign secretary than jack " .
as for mr murray himself , he is less flattering , suggesting the man who sacked him should be portrayed by alan rickman - the actor who once pulled off the formidable task of making the sheriff of nottingham appear more evil that ever before .
however , this may all prove pointless .
government officials are set to take legal action to stop both the book and film on the grounds it was a " betrayal of trust " to produce the book which , it was claimed , is " misleading and incorrect " .
" we will actively consider our legal options if mr murray publishes his book , " said a spokesman .
ok , but what if al pacino agrees to play the foreign secretary then ? 1530 gmt , tuesday 28 march we all know what it 's like .
you live in the same house for donkeys ' years and eventually the stuffing falls out of the sofa , the mattresses sag and the kids break your favourite coffee table .
all part of the wear and tear of daily living - requiring a trip to the local furniture shop and a raid on the credit card .
but £ 30,000 in one year ?
that is what tony and cherie blair spent on furnishings in 10 downing street in 2004-5 .
and it was n't a one off .
in the previous five years they spent just short of £ 100,000 on furnishings - and you can get a lot of new coffee tables for that sort of money .
the figures have been obtained by liberal democrat mp norman baker who intends to investigate further to discover precisely what the cash was spent on .
" i 've been in downing street and the furniture looks perfectly alright to me .
it seems the prime minister is very cavalier when it comes to spending other people 's money to keep himself in comfort , " he said .
1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
willis wants marsh banned from schools celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1030 gmt , tuesday 21 march the labour party may already have money worries over the possible repayment of its secret £ 14million loans from wealthy businessmen - but there may be worse to come .
some party members are kicking up at the whacking 50 % increase in their subs from £ 24 to £ 36 which , they fear , is to help cover the debts .
i am told that many are already refusing to pay the increase and there are fears in party hq that the latest affair is only going to make matters worse .
and , with membership currently less than half what it was at the 1997 election , there is little optimism within the ranks that a recruitment drive will have much effect .
perhaps an appeal for donations might help ...
1300 gmt , tuesday 14 march this must mark the official start of a battle of the bearskins .
prince phillip is a bearskin wearer labour 's chris mullin tabled a commons motion asking for the traditional hats , worn by five guards regiments and royalty , including prince phillip , to be banned and replaced with fake fur alternatives to spare the bear .
now former scots guard soldier and bearskin wearer , tory mp ben wallace has hit back , insisting the hats should continue to be made from the real thing - and warning that to scrap them would threaten the livelihoods of the canadian inuit -lrb- eskimos -rrb- .
stressing the hats highlighted the regiment 's " glorious military traditions " he added : " the bearskin pelts used for them are sourced from a necessary cull of canadian bears carried out by the indigenous inuit people every year . "
and , in his amendment to mr mullin 's motion , he adds : " previous trials of artificial fur have failed to find an appropriate replacement and many bearskins last for many decades especially after the grooming that guardsmen are required to administer to them . " 1300 gmt , monday 13 march the long-running and often controversial issue of a commons crèche has started doing the rounds again , with many women mps once again asking why there is no such facility in the palace of westminster , particularly when all the parties are out to attract more women into the place .
finding room for children at one recent meeting , for example , labour 's ann cryer acidly remarked : " no room for a crèche , but if i remember correctly there is a smoking room . "
there is an unhappy history attached to this issue and previous , unsuccessful attempts to provide a crèche .
the official reason for the inaction has always been the lack of a suitable site for the facility .
in the past the old rifle range where gun totin ' mps and security staff used to practice their skills was suggested and then ruled out .
it was always said the cellar , claimed to be the one in which guy fawkes was discovered -lrb- maybe -rrb- , was inappropriate .
but ms cryer may have an idea .
after all , the commons authorities have signalled they intend to extend the existing ban on smoking to cover the entire palace when the government 's new anti-smoking laws come into effect mind you they would probably need to have the place professionally fumigated before opening it up to babes in arms .
1730 gmt , wednesday 8 march ming " the merciless " campbell has just reshuffled the lib dem frontbench and appears to have abolished the shadow cabinet post of minister for women .
that may well reflect the fact the tony blair 's minister meg munn is doing the job without pay so ming plans to match like with like .
but on international women 's day .
is n't that bad timing ?
not at all , insist the leader 's office .
ming does not believe in making women a special case but wants them to have full shadow cabinet portfolios and , as a result , has doubled to four the number in the top team .
he also intends to ensure women get new help and opportunities to become mps and progress through the ranks via the party 's gender balance task force .
meanwhile , after sacking tom brake as transport spokesman , sir menzies still left him to face transport questions in the commons later in the day .
ming the merciless indeed .
1230 gmt , tuesday 7 march new lib dem boss ming campbell is desperate to shrug off any suggestion he is a short-term , stop-gap leader .
for example , he teased his harrogate conference with a little joke about the last ming dynasty lasting 276 years .
but there may be at least one sign that he is not expecting to stay quite that long after all .
during the election campaign he was questioned over climate change and his attachment to his old gas guzzling , 5.3 litre v12 jaguar xjs car .
with a clear sense of regret , he declared everyone had to make sacrifices for the environment and the old girl would have to go .
however , it appears he apparently ca n't bring himself to actually pension the motor off but is keeping it in a barn at his home .
for future use perhaps ? 1300 gmt , monday 6 march one of westminster 's great historic institutions is to be abolished .
caborn supports pool contest not the house of lords or the office of speaker , it 's far more important than that .
bean counters in the palace of westminster , backed by a committee of mps , have decided that annie 's bar - probably the most famous of the dozen or so watering holes in this place - should bring down its shutters for good .
apparently the only bar in the palace where journalists and politicians can meet on an equal footing just does n't make enough money , so a review of catering facilities has concluded it must go .
annie 's may not draw the crowds it used to in the recent past but that is put down to new labour banning mps from setting foot in the place and its recent relocation to what looks like an old coal cellar .
but it still offers the only place where mps and journalists can meet each other without being at the grace and favour of one or other of them .
its annual pool contest , supported by sports minister richard caborn and dozens of mps , also raises large sums for charity .
annie 's used to be an essential part of the workings of westminster , particularly in the days of minority governments and periods when events in the commons actually mattered .
to add insult to injury , the authorities also suggested there was no need for a closing party .
think again .
1730 gmt , friday 3 march tessa jowell may be on tenterhooks over what the weekend newspapers have in store for her in the latest chapter on her husband 's business dealings .
and tony blair may even be wondering what sort of reception his decision to clear his friend and colleague will have in the coming days .
but cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell is clearly something less than stressed out over his role in the affair .
once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .

1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .

mr winterbottom has already pencilled steve ' alan partridge ' coogan in for the role of the diplomat whose yet-to-be published book , murder in samarkand , forms the basis of the planned film .
mr straw refuses to be drawn but fellow mps have their own suggestions and , if you ask me , the foreign secretary has nothing to be ashamed of .
so far suggestions to mr straw 's local newspaper have included al pacino , from tory nigel evans , who said the actor possessed the same " do n't mess with me " quality that he reckons mr straw has recently adopted .
labour 's gordon prentice suggested derek jacobi on the grounds it would take a consummate actor to play a man of as many parts as mr straw .
and labour 's greg pope called on bill nighy to step forward as he " might act as a better foreign secretary than jack " .
as for mr murray himself , he is less flattering , suggesting the man who sacked him should be portrayed by alan rickman - the actor who once pulled off the formidable task of making the sheriff of nottingham appear more evil that ever before .
however , this may all prove pointless .
government officials are set to take legal action to stop both the book and film on the grounds it was a " betrayal of trust " to produce the book which , it was claimed , is " misleading and incorrect " .
" we will actively consider our legal options if mr murray publishes his book , " said a spokesman .
ok , but what if al pacino agrees to play the foreign secretary then ? 1530 gmt , tuesday 28 march we all know what it 's like .
you live in the same house for donkeys ' years and eventually the stuffing falls out of the sofa , the mattresses sag and the kids break your favourite coffee table .
all part of the wear and tear of daily living - requiring a trip to the local furniture shop and a raid on the credit card .
but £ 30,000 in one year ?
that is what tony and cherie blair spent on furnishings in 10 downing street in 2004-5 .
and it was n't a one off .
in the previous five years they spent just short of £ 100,000 on furnishings - and you can get a lot of new coffee tables for that sort of money .
the figures have been obtained by liberal democrat mp norman baker who intends to investigate further to discover precisely what the cash was spent on .
" i 've been in downing street and the furniture looks perfectly alright to me .
it seems the prime minister is very cavalier when it comes to spending other people 's money to keep himself in comfort , " he said .
1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
willis wants marsh banned from schools celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1030 gmt , tuesday 21 march the labour party may already have money worries over the possible repayment of its secret £ 14million loans from wealthy businessmen - but there may be worse to come .
some party members are kicking up at the whacking 50 % increase in their subs from £ 24 to £ 36 which , they fear , is to help cover the debts .
i am told that many are already refusing to pay the increase and there are fears in party hq that the latest affair is only going to make matters worse .
and , with membership currently less than half what it was at the 1997 election , there is little optimism within the ranks that a recruitment drive will have much effect .
perhaps an appeal for donations might help ...
1300 gmt , tuesday 14 march this must mark the official start of a battle of the bearskins .
prince phillip is a bearskin wearer labour 's chris mullin tabled a commons motion asking for the traditional hats , worn by five guards regiments and royalty , including prince phillip , to be banned and replaced with fake fur alternatives to spare the bear .
now former scots guard soldier and bearskin wearer , tory mp ben wallace has hit back , insisting the hats should continue to be made from the real thing - and warning that to scrap them would threaten the livelihoods of the canadian inuit -lrb- eskimos -rrb- .
stressing the hats highlighted the regiment 's " glorious military traditions " he added : " the bearskin pelts used for them are sourced from a necessary cull of canadian bears carried out by the indigenous inuit people every year . "
and , in his amendment to mr mullin 's motion , he adds : " previous trials of artificial fur have failed to find an appropriate replacement and many bearskins last for many decades especially after the grooming that guardsmen are required to administer to them . " 1300 gmt , monday 13 march the long-running and often controversial issue of a commons crèche has started doing the rounds again , with many women mps once again asking why there is no such facility in the palace of westminster , particularly when all the parties are out to attract more women into the place .
finding room for children at one recent meeting , for example , labour 's ann cryer acidly remarked : " no room for a crèche , but if i remember correctly there is a smoking room . "
there is an unhappy history attached to this issue and previous , unsuccessful attempts to provide a crèche .
the official reason for the inaction has always been the lack of a suitable site for the facility .
in the past the old rifle range where gun totin ' mps and security staff used to practice their skills was suggested and then ruled out .
it was always said the cellar , claimed to be the one in which guy fawkes was discovered -lrb- maybe -rrb- , was inappropriate .
but ms cryer may have an idea .
after all , the commons authorities have signalled they intend to extend the existing ban on smoking to cover the entire palace when the government 's new anti-smoking laws come into effect mind you they would probably need to have the place professionally fumigated before opening it up to babes in arms .
1730 gmt , wednesday 8 march ming " the merciless " campbell has just reshuffled the lib dem frontbench and appears to have abolished the shadow cabinet post of minister for women .
that may well reflect the fact the tony blair 's minister meg munn is doing the job without pay so ming plans to match like with like .
but on international women 's day .
is n't that bad timing ?
not at all , insist the leader 's office .
ming does not believe in making women a special case but wants them to have full shadow cabinet portfolios and , as a result , has doubled to four the number in the top team .
he also intends to ensure women get new help and opportunities to become mps and progress through the ranks via the party 's gender balance task force .
meanwhile , after sacking tom brake as transport spokesman , sir menzies still left him to face transport questions in the commons later in the day .
ming the merciless indeed .
1230 gmt , tuesday 7 march new lib dem boss ming campbell is desperate to shrug off any suggestion he is a short-term , stop-gap leader .
for example , he teased his harrogate conference with a little joke about the last ming dynasty lasting 276 years .
but there may be at least one sign that he is not expecting to stay quite that long after all .
during the election campaign he was questioned over climate change and his attachment to his old gas guzzling , 5.3 litre v12 jaguar xjs car .
with a clear sense of regret , he declared everyone had to make sacrifices for the environment and the old girl would have to go .
however , it appears he apparently ca n't bring himself to actually pension the motor off but is keeping it in a barn at his home .
for future use perhaps ? 1300 gmt , monday 6 march one of westminster 's great historic institutions is to be abolished .
caborn supports pool contest not the house of lords or the office of speaker , it 's far more important than that .
bean counters in the palace of westminster , backed by a committee of mps , have decided that annie 's bar - probably the most famous of the dozen or so watering holes in this place - should bring down its shutters for good .
apparently the only bar in the palace where journalists and politicians can meet on an equal footing just does n't make enough money , so a review of catering facilities has concluded it must go .
annie 's may not draw the crowds it used to in the recent past but that is put down to new labour banning mps from setting foot in the place and its recent relocation to what looks like an old coal cellar .
but it still offers the only place where mps and journalists can meet each other without being at the grace and favour of one or other of them .
its annual pool contest , supported by sports minister richard caborn and dozens of mps , also raises large sums for charity .
annie 's used to be an essential part of the workings of westminster , particularly in the days of minority governments and periods when events in the commons actually mattered .
to add insult to injury , the authorities also suggested there was no need for a closing party .
think again .
1730 gmt , friday 3 march tessa jowell may be on tenterhooks over what the weekend newspapers have in store for her in the latest chapter on her husband 's business dealings .
and tony blair may even be wondering what sort of reception his decision to clear his friend and colleague will have in the coming days .
but cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell is clearly something less than stressed out over his role in the affair .
once he had delivered the facts of the case to the prime minister for his ruling , sir gus was on his way home looking , i am told , extremely relaxed and happy he had done his duty and , as far as he is concerned , no longer has any responsibility for the matter .
on friday he was set to pay a visit to the north east of england meeting colleagues in his role as head of the home civil service and then there were plans for a family weekend .
considering the way he handled his part of the " investigation " he probably has good reason to feel pleased - but he may yet have even more reason to feel relieved this is no longer sitting in his pending tray .
1000 gmt , thursday 2 march his wife tessa jowell may have been feeling a little happier this morning but david mills was definitely having a bad car day .
he left his house to be greeted by the traditional scrum of photographers , cameramen and reporters and shouts about his business dealings .
to the confusion of all he said " check this out " and added the italian word " strumentalizzazione " , which apparently translates as manipulation .
then he drove off in his silver bmw , running over the foot of a cameraman before smashing his wing mirror into the same unfortunate cameraman 's open rear car door .
" i wonder who 's going to pay for that then ? " he asked - in english .
good question .
1430 gmt , wednesday 1 march here 's some proof that youngsters are not as turned off politics as many believe .
the annual national school essay writing competition organised by the press gallery drew more than 300 entries from around the country .
and here is what the judges said about one of the winners , 16 year old christopher rigby , from wigan and his essay entitled parliament and government - spot the difference . " he begins by quoting french philosophers and uses classic references to illustrate his point .
" he could probably give an interesting lecture on the subject , even suggesting the idea of reducing the size of the electorate by forcing voters to undergo a political intelligence test to earn their vote - but he rejects this as extreme " .
indeed , that would probably rule out most mps and political journalists .
the other overall winner , 14 year old thomas-neil hogg from winchester college along with the 15 regional winners were treated to a tour of westminster and lunch in the commons before visiting downing street to meet the prime minister .
tony blair , i am reliably informed , already has his eye on a couple of potential successors .
i do n't know .
young people these days .

a state department spokesman said politicians like the sandinista leader were " discredited figures from the country 's political past " .
mr ortega 's sandinistas led nicaragua in the 1980s with strong us opposition .
the us controversially helped to arm and train the contra rebels in their war to overthrow the sandinistas .
power struggle after nearly 10 years of civil war , mr ortega lost the 1990 elections to violeta chamorro .
in 2002 , he ran for office again , but was defeated by the current president , enrique bolanos .
mr ortega 's sandinistas later joined forces with members of mr bolanos ' liberal party who were angered by the government 's decision to prosecute former president arnoldo aleman .
the ensuing power struggle between mr bolanos and his opponents led last year to international warnings that nicaraguan democracy was under threat .
in october 2005 , after months of wrangling , mr bolanos and mr ortega reached a deal to delay constitutional reforms which weaken the president 's powers until after the elections .
the bush administration has in the past accused the sandinista leader and mr aleman of mounting a " creeping coup " against the nicaraguan government .
on monday , the us ambassador in managua , paul trivelli , held talks with the country 's main right-wing parties to discuss the possibility of their forming an alliance to oppose mr ortega .

members of holyrood 's education committee spent a year investigating what turns children off school .
the committee urged the scottish executive to " emphasise relentlessly " the importance of education for all .
they also called for earlier work to identify youngsters likely to become disillusioned with formal education .
the msps heard evidence that secondary school pupils ' activities were often dominated by course assessments which restricted teachers ' ability to employ a range of learning styles best suited to individuals .
work experience they called for " practical steps " to be taken to lighten the assessment and examination load on pupils and teachers .
the executive was also urged to explore further ways of enhancing the status and value of vocational school education and work experience opportunities .
all teachers , not just school heads , should be helped to develop leadership skills beyond education , the report added .
msps urged the executive to explore ways of providing career breaks , secondments and exchanges to supplement skills and experience . "
this apparent polarisation , with the pupil population being divided into improving and static groups is clearly a cause for concern " education committee report the recommendations were the result of a year-long inquiry into pupil motivation .
education minister peter peacock told the committee last june that scotland had a " generally positive education system " where most pupils were reasonably well motivated .
however , he conceded that there was " a clear problem " among the 20 % lowest attaining youngsters .
committee convener iain smith said msps recognised the " range of work " being undertaken by the executive but were keen efforts continued to help those achieving least from formal education .
the committee 's report stated : " this apparent polarisation , with the pupil population being divided into improving and static groups , is clearly a cause for concern . "
it added : " the scottish executive is in the best position to provide overall strategic leadership in continuing to emphasise relentlessly the importance of education for everyone . "
