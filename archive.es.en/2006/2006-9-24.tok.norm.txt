program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .
germany has so much more to offer than such sentimental goo . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postcard from germany : raising a stein to oktoberfest the world 's biggest party hit munich this year with 18 days of gingerbread hearts , gargantuan pretzels and beer-soaked revelry .

hamburg wants to install surveillance cameras on the city 's red-light drag , the reeperbahn , to fight violent crime .
the plan comes at a time when germany is mulling expanding existing security measures .

coach felix magath and his players expected nothing less .
and they got it , defeating aachen 2-1 .
but it was hardly the convincing victory 66,000 bayern supporters would have expected . in fact , it was the guests - absent from the bundesliga for 36 years entering this season - who provided the first shock in the 38th minute .
bayern 's brazilian defender lucio deflected a sascha dum free kick which then fluttered into oliver kahn 's net as he helplessly flew in the wrong direction . but before aachen could celebrate their unexpected lead , claudio pizarro headed home the equalizer and the score stood 1-1 as the two sides headed to the locker room at half . after the interval , bayern increased the pressure and it was michael ballack 's replacement , mark van bommel , who scored the game-winner , and also took his new team to the top of the league standings on goal difference . kura n yi improves his status with löw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- left -rrb- puts his club on top schalke were able to keep pace with bayern munich with a hard-fought 2-0 win over wolfsburg at home . after a week in which a controversy over the playing time of schalke 's german national player gerald asamoah continued , kevin kuranyi put the problem to rest for the time being when he headed the " royal blues " into the lead early in the second half . at the same time kuranyi improved his chances of being recalled into the national team by coach joachim löw .
lincoln then sealed schalke 's victory over the " wolves " with his 89th minute goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hard way to meet again for frings -lrb- left -rrb- and sorin for pre-season title contenders hamburg and bremen , the northern derby on the 5th match day already had great meaning , but neither side profited from a 1-1 draw . bremen 's tim borowski shot his team in front in the 58th minute but hamburg defender bastian reinhardt equalized 10 minutes later .
hamburg were then able to hold onto the draw despite defender mehdi mahdavikia being sent off for a hard challenge with over 15 minutes remaining . traffic jam i n the middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakary diakite -lrb- back -rrb- scored mainz ' lone goal a glance at the standings will show that offensive power has been lacking this season .
no team has yet to score 10 goals , causing congestion in the middle of the table .
stuttgart and frankfurt also drew 1-1 , leaving both sides with seven points together with three other clubs : bremen , dortmund and cottbus .
stuttgart looked as if they would notch their first home victory of the season after mario gomez ' 73rd minute strike .
but alexander meier saved a point for frankfurt with a goal two minutes from time . mainz also find themselves going neither up nor down after a 1-1 draw with berlin .
also scoreless at half , mainz took the lead quickly after the re-start on a headball goal by bakary diakite .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .

instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .

besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .

according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .

germany 's best soccer clubs have stumbled out of the starting block this season .
failing to meet high expectations , bayern munich 's karl-heinz rummenigge asks for mercy from the league . the first two matches ended in victory , but after a home draw to nuremberg and an away loss to arminia bielefeld , the bosses at bayern munich are looking for answers as to why their side does n't sit atop the league standings .
is coach felix magath to blame for not instilling enough fire into his star ensemble ? he heard plenty of complaining from bayern 's front office head 's karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer this week about him failing to motivate the troops .
when magath then declared that he presumed his boys would " be successful " against newly-promoted side aachen , general manager uli hoeness snapped back that he did n't expect a draw against a promoted team in front of 70,000 supporters . such are the worries for the bundesliga 's most successful team , which did end up winning against aachen 2-1 on saturday .
but rummenigge is fully aware that bayern is not alone . " i am under the impression that the clubs which provided lots of national players for the world cup -lrb- this summer -rrb- are now paying the bill , " he wrote in bayern munich 's fan magazine .

9 . for rummenigge , the vacation and the time for preparation before the season kick-off were " too short . "
but he also did not hesitate in lashing out at the national players who earn their money with bayern munich . " in the future , we will demand that these players give 100 percent to bayern munich just like they did at the world cup , " he told the munich az newspaper , making reference to players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- germany -rrb- and willy sagnol -lrb- france -rrb- .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .
officials had originally planned to decide this fall whether a 37-kilometer -lrb- 22.9-mile -rrb- track would be built from munich airport to the bavarian capital 's city center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee -lrb- center -rrb- visited the crash site saturday after cutting short a trip to china " for me , this is first and foremost about security , " tiefensee told reporters after the meeting with representatives from the companies that developed the transrapid maglev train technology , which is so far only used in shanghai and on the test track , where 23 people were killed on friday when a train crashed into a repair car that was still on the track . " such an accident must never happen again , " tiefensee said , adding that the federal and bavarian state governments would appoint an independent investigator to look into causes of the crash . chi n a n o lo n ger i n terested ? while tiefensee said that the technology itself should not be called into question at this point , chinese officials are reportedly losing faith . germany daily die welt will report in its monday edition that chinese officials will talk about further transrapid projects this week . a planned extension of the shanghai line is now highly unlikely , according to the paper . huma n error respo n sible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's front car was almost completely destroyed investigators of the crash in germany meanwhile said that human error was likely to blame for the accident as workers had failed to notice that the repair car was still on the track .
it 's also not clear why the train drivers did not activate the emergency brakes earlier as the repair car should have been visible on the track from far away . tiefensee , his bavarian counterpart and transrapid developers said that the security concept for a track in munich would be expanded , preventing a similar accident to happen on that line . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

germany 's best soccer clubs have stumbled out of the starting block this season .
failing to meet high expectations , bayern munich 's karl-heinz rummenigge asks for mercy from the league . the first two matches ended in victory , but after a home draw to nuremberg and an away loss to arminia bielefeld , the bosses at bayern munich are looking for answers as to why their side does n't sit atop the league standings .
is coach felix magath to blame for not instilling enough fire into his star ensemble ? he heard plenty of complaining from bayern 's front office head 's karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer this week about him failing to motivate the troops .
when magath then declared that he presumed his boys would " be successful " against newly-promoted side aachen , general manager uli hoeness snapped back that he did n't expect a draw against a promoted team in front of 70,000 supporters . such are the worries for the bundesliga 's most successful team , which did end up winning against aachen 2-1 on saturday .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .
officials had originally planned to decide this fall whether a 37-kilometer -lrb- 22.9-mile -rrb- track would be built from munich airport to the bavarian capital 's city center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee -lrb- center -rrb- visited the crash site saturday after cutting short a trip to china " for me , this is first and foremost about security , " tiefensee told reporters after the meeting with representatives from the companies that developed the transrapid maglev train technology , which is so far only used in shanghai and on the test track , where 23 people were killed on friday when a train crashed into a repair car that was still on the track . " such an accident must never happen again , " tiefensee said , adding that the federal and bavarian state governments would appoint an independent investigator to look into causes of the crash . chi n a n o lo n ger i n terested ? while tiefensee said that the technology itself should not be called into question at this point , chinese officials are reportedly losing faith . germany daily die welt will report in its monday edition that chinese officials will talk about further transrapid projects this week . a planned extension of the shanghai line is now highly unlikely , according to the paper . huma n error respo n sible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's front car was almost completely destroyed investigators of the crash in germany meanwhile said that human error was likely to blame for the accident as workers had failed to notice that the repair car was still on the track .
it 's also not clear why the train drivers did not activate the emergency brakes earlier as the repair car should have been visible on the track from far away . tiefensee , his bavarian counterpart and transrapid developers said that the security concept for a track in munich would be expanded , preventing a similar accident to happen on that line . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

" the aim of this reform is to uphold switzerland 's humanitarian tradition while at the same time halting abuses , " blocher said in a recent speech . dema n di n g docume n tatio n like some of his european counterparts , blocher - a politician from the right-wing swiss people 's party - claims that many document-less asylum seekers turn up empty-handed deliberately to make it more difficult to send them home or investigate claims of persecution . to counter such alleged trickery , the new law would require all asylum seekers to present documents within 48 hours of making a claim , and severely restrict applications from people who can not present any identification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without proper documents , it will be hard for people to get past this sign in the future that key plank of the reform has sparked strong debate .

authorities would be able to place " recalcitrant " foreigners in detention for 18 months - rather than the current nine months - prior to deportation to ensure they do not go underground , and to encourage them to leave . blocher has said that it is essential to streamline the system , cut costs and reduce the temptation to make spurious asylum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss cities , including the capital bern -lrb- pictured -rrb- , are not exactly swamped with asylum seekers but critics counter that switzerland does not need a crackdown , because it is far from being " swamped " : 18,844 people applied for asylum in 2005 , one of the lowest numbers in almost two decades .
around 35 percent of applicants have been granted asylum over the past 10 years . swiss lawmakers have already passed the legislation , but opponents gathered enough signatures to force a referendum , the linchpin of the alpine country 's democratic system . the 4.8 million swiss voters can have the final say on issues in popular votes which are held several times a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss back opening labor market swiss voters sunday backed opening the country 's labour market to workers from the eu 's 10 new member states , with 55.95 percent in favour , according to referendum results from across the country .

" the aim of this reform is to uphold switzerland 's humanitarian tradition while at the same time halting abuses , " blocher said in a recent speech . dema n di n g docume n tatio n like some of his european counterparts , blocher - a politician from the right-wing swiss people 's party - claims that many document-less asylum seekers turn up empty-handed deliberately to make it more difficult to send them home or investigate claims of persecution . to counter such alleged trickery , the new law would require all asylum seekers to present documents within 48 hours of making a claim , and severely restrict applications from people who can not present any identification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without proper documents , it will be hard for people to get past this sign in the future that key plank of the reform has sparked strong debate .
critics - including the un refugee agency - argue that it is often impossible or too risky for people who face a threat to get documents from their home authorities before fleeing .
international refugee rules , which have been in place since 1951 , say that such individuals should not be shut out of the system . blocher has noted that the new law nonetheless contains safeguards for those who are " clearly " refugees and can provide a " plausible " explanation for their lack of documents . more restrictio n the new rules would also cement tight restrictions on financial support for rejected asylum seekers who have been in place for two years .
authorities would be able to place " recalcitrant " foreigners in detention for 18 months - rather than the current nine months - prior to deportation to ensure they do not go underground , and to encourage them to leave . blocher has said that it is essential to streamline the system , cut costs and reduce the temptation to make spurious asylum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss cities , including the capital bern -lrb- pictured -rrb- , are not exactly swamped with asylum seekers but critics counter that switzerland does not need a crackdown , because it is far from being " swamped " : 18,844 people applied for asylum in 2005 , one of the lowest numbers in almost two decades .
around 35 percent of applicants have been granted asylum over the past 10 years . swiss lawmakers have already passed the legislation , but opponents gathered enough signatures to force a referendum , the linchpin of the alpine country 's democratic system . the 4.8 million swiss voters can have the final say on issues in popular votes which are held several times a year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss back opening labor market swiss voters sunday backed opening the country 's labour market to workers from the eu 's 10 new member states , with 55.95 percent in favour , according to referendum results from across the country .

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .
officials had originally planned to decide this fall whether a 37-kilometer -lrb- 22.9-mile -rrb- track would be built from munich airport to the bavarian capital 's city center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee -lrb- center -rrb- visited the crash site saturday after cutting short a trip to china " for me , this is first and foremost about security , " tiefensee told reporters after the meeting with representatives from the companies that developed the transrapid maglev train technology , which is so far only used in shanghai and on the test track , where 23 people were killed on friday when a train crashed into a repair car that was still on the track . " such an accident must never happen again , " tiefensee said , adding that the federal and bavarian state governments would appoint an independent investigator to look into causes of the crash . chi n a n o lo n ger i n terested ? while tiefensee said that the technology itself should not be called into question at this point , chinese officials are reportedly losing faith . germany daily die welt will report in its monday edition that chinese officials will talk about further transrapid projects this week . a planned extension of the shanghai line is now highly unlikely , according to the paper . huma n error respo n sible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's front car was almost completely destroyed investigators of the crash in germany meanwhile said that human error was likely to blame for the accident as workers had failed to notice that the repair car was still on the track .
it 's also not clear why the train drivers did not activate the emergency brakes earlier as the repair car should have been visible on the track from far away . tiefensee , his bavarian counterpart and transrapid developers said that the security concept for a track in munich would be expanded , preventing a similar accident to happen on that line . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .
germany has so much more to offer than such sentimental goo . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postcard from germany : raising a stein to oktoberfest the world 's biggest party hit munich this year with 18 days of gingerbread hearts , gargantuan pretzels and beer-soaked revelry .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .

instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .

apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .

authorities would be able to place " recalcitrant " foreigners in detention for 18 months - rather than the current nine months - prior to deportation to ensure they do not go underground , and to encourage them to leave . blocher has said that it is essential to streamline the system , cut costs and reduce the temptation to make spurious asylum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss cities , including the capital bern -lrb- pictured -rrb- , are not exactly swamped with asylum seekers but critics counter that switzerland does not need a crackdown , because it is far from being " swamped " : 18,844 people applied for asylum in 2005 , one of the lowest numbers in almost two decades .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .
officials had originally planned to decide this fall whether a 37-kilometer -lrb- 22.9-mile -rrb- track would be built from munich airport to the bavarian capital 's city center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee -lrb- center -rrb- visited the crash site saturday after cutting short a trip to china " for me , this is first and foremost about security , " tiefensee told reporters after the meeting with representatives from the companies that developed the transrapid maglev train technology , which is so far only used in shanghai and on the test track , where 23 people were killed on friday when a train crashed into a repair car that was still on the track . " such an accident must never happen again , " tiefensee said , adding that the federal and bavarian state governments would appoint an independent investigator to look into causes of the crash . chi n a n o lo n ger i n terested ? while tiefensee said that the technology itself should not be called into question at this point , chinese officials are reportedly losing faith . germany daily die welt will report in its monday edition that chinese officials will talk about further transrapid projects this week . a planned extension of the shanghai line is now highly unlikely , according to the paper . huma n error respo n sible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's front car was almost completely destroyed investigators of the crash in germany meanwhile said that human error was likely to blame for the accident as workers had failed to notice that the repair car was still on the track .
it 's also not clear why the train drivers did not activate the emergency brakes earlier as the repair car should have been visible on the track from far away . tiefensee , his bavarian counterpart and transrapid developers said that the security concept for a track in munich would be expanded , preventing a similar accident to happen on that line . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

since germany was reestablished in 1948 , its parliament has been called the " bundestag . "
when the government moved to berlin in 1999 , the bundestag moved into the former reichstag building .

" the neo-nazis said one of their aims is to replace parliamentary democracy with a new system of government in germany and called the existing system unable to resolve people 's problems .

fc nuremberg failed to retake the league 's top spot , but remained unbeated after a 1-1 draw against fc energie cottbus . vfl bochum meanwhile claimed a 2-1 victory in their home match against arminia bielfeld , handing over the bottom spot in the league table to vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern striker pizarro -lrb- right -rrb- did n't have his back to the goal to score the equalizer on saturday , bayern munich 's front office demanded a victory at home against newly-promoted alemannia aachen .
coach felix magath and his players expected nothing less .
and they got it , defeating aachen 2-1 .
but it was hardly the convincing victory 66,000 bayern supporters would have expected . in fact , it was the guests - absent from the bundesliga for 36 years entering this season - who provided the first shock in the 38th minute .
bayern 's brazilian defender lucio deflected a sascha dum free kick which then fluttered into oliver kahn 's net as he helplessly flew in the wrong direction . but before aachen could celebrate their unexpected lead , claudio pizarro headed home the equalizer and the score stood 1-1 as the two sides headed to the locker room at half . after the interval , bayern increased the pressure and it was michael ballack 's replacement , mark van bommel , who scored the game-winner , and also took his new team to the top of the league standings on goal difference . kura n yi improves his status with löw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- left -rrb- puts his club on top schalke were able to keep pace with bayern munich with a hard-fought 2-0 win over wolfsburg at home . after a week in which a controversy over the playing time of schalke 's german national player gerald asamoah continued , kevin kuranyi put the problem to rest for the time being when he headed the " royal blues " into the lead early in the second half . at the same time kuranyi improved his chances of being recalled into the national team by coach joachim löw .
lincoln then sealed schalke 's victory over the " wolves " with his 89th minute goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hard way to meet again for frings -lrb- left -rrb- and sorin for pre-season title contenders hamburg and bremen , the northern derby on the 5th match day already had great meaning , but neither side profited from a 1-1 draw . bremen 's tim borowski shot his team in front in the 58th minute but hamburg defender bastian reinhardt equalized 10 minutes later .
hamburg were then able to hold onto the draw despite defender mehdi mahdavikia being sent off for a hard challenge with over 15 minutes remaining . traffic jam i n the middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakary diakite -lrb- back -rrb- scored mainz ' lone goal a glance at the standings will show that offensive power has been lacking this season .
no team has yet to score 10 goals , causing congestion in the middle of the table .
stuttgart and frankfurt also drew 1-1 , leaving both sides with seven points together with three other clubs : bremen , dortmund and cottbus .
stuttgart looked as if they would notch their first home victory of the season after mario gomez ' 73rd minute strike .
but alexander meier saved a point for frankfurt with a goal two minutes from time . mainz also find themselves going neither up nor down after a 1-1 draw with berlin .
also scoreless at half , mainz took the lead quickly after the re-start on a headball goal by bakary diakite .
berlin 's kevin-prince boateng equalized seven minutes later , but the club from the capital gave up first place in the process . barbarez ' first goal with leverkuse n n ot e n ough in his fifth game after transferring from hamburg , leverkusen 's sergej barbarez got his first goal with the club on the rhine , putting his side up temporarily over hanover .
but thomas brdaric found the net for the third time in two matches and gave hanover a point . on friday night , borussia mönchengladbach downed borussia dortmund 1-0 .
brazilian striker , whom many gladbach fans booed before the season began , got his league-leading fourth goal , leaving the five-time german champions just one point from the top of the standings . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de day of surprises in bundesliga as big three are defeated it was the day of the underdog in the bundesliga as last season 's top three bayern munich , werder bremen and sv hamburg all lost their games on saturday .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .
-lrb- 22.09.2006 -rrb- german authorities deny knowledge of el masri interrogator a parliamentary committee looking into the role of german intelligence during the iraq war was told there was no proof of collusion by german authorities in the abduction of a man who says he was kidnapped by the cia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .

" now we want to tackle the west , " said udo voigt , chairman of the far-right extremist national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- , this week in berlin , just days after his party won more than 7 percent of the vote in state elections in mecklenburg-western pommerania . under the motto " work - family - home , " leaders of the npd and the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- renewed their alliance thursday , saying their strategy of striking separately but winning together has been bearing fruit . npd wants seats in " reichstag " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two far-right parties agreed to stop fighting each other voigt 's fellow party leader holger apfel said the npd had to " do its homework in the west " if it wanted to make it into the " reichstag " in 2009 . with the word " reichstag , " apfel alluded to the nazi parliament during the third reich .
since germany was reestablished in 1948 , its parliament has been called the " bundestag . "
when the government moved to berlin in 1999 , the bundestag moved into the former reichstag building .
counseling for job-seekers the npd gained votes in last sunday 's state elections in mecklenburg-western pommerania on an anti-establishment and anti-foreigner platform .
the party has also emphasized its plan to engage in community work and set up counseling offices , particularly for the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd gained support among young voters in the last election " i 'll not only devote all of my energies to parliamentary work now , but also to the overarching goal of uniting nationalist forces outside the parliament , " the npd 's udo pastörs said .
" i 'll actively work for a political movement devoted to nationalist and socially caring policies . " the neo-nazis said one of their aims is to replace parliamentary democracy with a new system of government in germany and called the existing system unable to resolve people 's problems . " the federal republic 's parliamentarianism can not be the final stage , " voigt said .
other members of his party have also argued for germany to renegotiate it national borders . constitutionality questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out ! " - the far-right wo n't find fertile ground everywhere against the background of such statements , voices are mounting in germany that demand a fresh attempt to ban the npd for unconstitutional activities . the latest attempt to do so failed in 2003 after germany 's highest court threw out a case promoted by the german government and parliament . a study conducted friday by german public broadcaster ard showed 82 percent of germans do not believe the npd to be a democratic party while 70 percent said the party 's gains have hurt germany 's international image . gerhard frey , a multi-millionaire publishing giant and leader of the dvu , however , said he is confident the far-right will be able to gain ground . " as long as this government sends our young soldiers into a middle east conflict that is not ours and as long as it wastes money on the eu while more and more germans pinch and scrape , we will increase our following , " he said . uwe hessler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .
-lrb- 22.09.2006 -rrb- german authorities deny knowledge of el masri interrogator a parliamentary committee looking into the role of german intelligence during the iraq war was told there was no proof of collusion by german authorities in the abduction of a man who says he was kidnapped by the cia .
-lrb- 23.06.2006 -rrb- us court dismisses el masri a united states court has dismissed a lawsuit brought by the german el masri who says he was illegally detained and tortured in overseas prisons run by the cia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .
germany has so much more to offer than such sentimental goo . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postcard from germany : raising a stein to oktoberfest the world 's biggest party hit munich this year with 18 days of gingerbread hearts , gargantuan pretzels and beer-soaked revelry .
a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. -lrb- 19.09.2006 -rrb- a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .
many routes are sought after by travelers who enjoy relaxing on a cruise ship and letting the world drift by .

hamburg wants to install surveillance cameras on the city 's red-light drag , the reeperbahn , to fight violent crime .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .
officials had originally planned to decide this fall whether a 37-kilometer -lrb- 22.9-mile -rrb- track would be built from munich airport to the bavarian capital 's city center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee -lrb- center -rrb- visited the crash site saturday after cutting short a trip to china " for me , this is first and foremost about security , " tiefensee told reporters after the meeting with representatives from the companies that developed the transrapid maglev train technology , which is so far only used in shanghai and on the test track , where 23 people were killed on friday when a train crashed into a repair car that was still on the track . " such an accident must never happen again , " tiefensee said , adding that the federal and bavarian state governments would appoint an independent investigator to look into causes of the crash . chi n a n o lo n ger i n terested ? while tiefensee said that the technology itself should not be called into question at this point , chinese officials are reportedly losing faith . germany daily die welt will report in its monday edition that chinese officials will talk about further transrapid projects this week . a planned extension of the shanghai line is now highly unlikely , according to the paper . huma n error respo n sible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's front car was almost completely destroyed investigators of the crash in germany meanwhile said that human error was likely to blame for the accident as workers had failed to notice that the repair car was still on the track .
it 's also not clear why the train drivers did not activate the emergency brakes earlier as the repair car should have been visible on the track from far away . tiefensee , his bavarian counterpart and transrapid developers said that the security concept for a track in munich would be expanded , preventing a similar accident to happen on that line . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology . speaking after a meeting in berlin , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said that the decision about a commercial maglev line in munich might have to be postponed .

coach felix magath and his players expected nothing less .
and they got it , defeating aachen 2-1 .
but it was hardly the convincing victory 66,000 bayern supporters would have expected . in fact , it was the guests - absent from the bundesliga for 36 years entering this season - who provided the first shock in the 38th minute .
bayern 's brazilian defender lucio deflected a sascha dum free kick which then fluttered into oliver kahn 's net as he helplessly flew in the wrong direction . but before aachen could celebrate their unexpected lead , claudio pizarro headed home the equalizer and the score stood 1-1 as the two sides headed to the locker room at half . after the interval , bayern increased the pressure and it was michael ballack 's replacement , mark van bommel , who scored the game-winner , and also took his new team to the top of the league standings on goal difference . kura n yi improves his status with löw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- left -rrb- puts his club on top schalke were able to keep pace with bayern munich with a hard-fought 2-0 win over wolfsburg at home . after a week in which a controversy over the playing time of schalke 's german national player gerald asamoah continued , kevin kuranyi put the problem to rest for the time being when he headed the " royal blues " into the lead early in the second half . at the same time kuranyi improved his chances of being recalled into the national team by coach joachim löw .

hamburg were then able to hold onto the draw despite defender mehdi mahdavikia being sent off for a hard challenge with over 15 minutes remaining . traffic jam i n the middle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakary diakite -lrb- back -rrb- scored mainz ' lone goal a glance at the standings will show that offensive power has been lacking this season .

stuttgart and frankfurt also drew 1-1 , leaving both sides with seven points together with three other clubs : bremen , dortmund and cottbus .
stuttgart looked as if they would notch their first home victory of the season after mario gomez ' 73rd minute strike .
but alexander meier saved a point for frankfurt with a goal two minutes from time . mainz also find themselves going neither up nor down after a 1-1 draw with berlin .
also scoreless at half , mainz took the lead quickly after the re-start on a headball goal by bakary diakite .

instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .

even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .

apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .

coach felix magath and his players expected nothing less .

bayern 's brazilian defender lucio deflected a sascha dum free kick which then fluttered into oliver kahn 's net as he helplessly flew in the wrong direction . but before aachen could celebrate their unexpected lead , claudio pizarro headed home the equalizer and the score stood 1-1 as the two sides headed to the locker room at half . after the interval , bayern increased the pressure and it was michael ballack 's replacement , mark van bommel , who scored the game-winner , and also took his new team to the top of the league standings on goal difference . kura n yi improves his status with löw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- left -rrb- puts his club on top schalke were able to keep pace with bayern munich with a hard-fought 2-0 win over wolfsburg at home . after a week in which a controversy over the playing time of schalke 's german national player gerald asamoah continued , kevin kuranyi put the problem to rest for the time being when he headed the " royal blues " into the lead early in the second half . at the same time kuranyi improved his chances of being recalled into the national team by coach joachim löw .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .
germany has so much more to offer than such sentimental goo . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postcard from germany : raising a stein to oktoberfest the world 's biggest party hit munich this year with 18 days of gingerbread hearts , gargantuan pretzels and beer-soaked revelry .

" now we want to tackle the west , " said udo voigt , chairman of the far-right extremist national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- , this week in berlin , just days after his party won more than 7 percent of the vote in state elections in mecklenburg-western pommerania . under the motto " work - family - home , " leaders of the npd and the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- renewed their alliance thursday , saying their strategy of striking separately but winning together has been bearing fruit . npd wants seats in " reichstag " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two far-right parties agreed to stop fighting each other voigt 's fellow party leader holger apfel said the npd had to " do its homework in the west " if it wanted to make it into the " reichstag " in 2009 . with the word " reichstag , " apfel alluded to the nazi parliament during the third reich .
since germany was reestablished in 1948 , its parliament has been called the " bundestag . "
when the government moved to berlin in 1999 , the bundestag moved into the former reichstag building .
counseling for job-seekers the npd gained votes in last sunday 's state elections in mecklenburg-western pommerania on an anti-establishment and anti-foreigner platform .
the party has also emphasized its plan to engage in community work and set up counseling offices , particularly for the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd gained support among young voters in the last election " i 'll not only devote all of my energies to parliamentary work now , but also to the overarching goal of uniting nationalist forces outside the parliament , " the npd 's udo pastörs said .
" i 'll actively work for a political movement devoted to nationalist and socially caring policies . " the neo-nazis said one of their aims is to replace parliamentary democracy with a new system of government in germany and called the existing system unable to resolve people 's problems . " the federal republic 's parliamentarianism can not be the final stage , " voigt said .
other members of his party have also argued for germany to renegotiate it national borders . constitutionality questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out ! " - the far-right wo n't find fertile ground everywhere against the background of such statements , voices are mounting in germany that demand a fresh attempt to ban the npd for unconstitutional activities . the latest attempt to do so failed in 2003 after germany 's highest court threw out a case promoted by the german government and parliament . a study conducted friday by german public broadcaster ard showed 82 percent of germans do not believe the npd to be a democratic party while 70 percent said the party 's gains have hurt germany 's international image . gerhard frey , a multi-millionaire publishing giant and leader of the dvu , however , said he is confident the far-right will be able to gain ground . " as long as this government sends our young soldiers into a middle east conflict that is not ours and as long as it wastes money on the eu while more and more germans pinch and scrape , we will increase our following , " he said . uwe hessler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .

germany 's best soccer clubs have stumbled out of the starting block this season .
failing to meet high expectations , bayern munich 's karl-heinz rummenigge asks for mercy from the league . the first two matches ended in victory , but after a home draw to nuremberg and an away loss to arminia bielefeld , the bosses at bayern munich are looking for answers as to why their side does n't sit atop the league standings .
is coach felix magath to blame for not instilling enough fire into his star ensemble ? he heard plenty of complaining from bayern 's front office head 's karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer this week about him failing to motivate the troops .
when magath then declared that he presumed his boys would " be successful " against newly-promoted side aachen , general manager uli hoeness snapped back that he did n't expect a draw against a promoted team in front of 70,000 supporters . such are the worries for the bundesliga 's most successful team , which did end up winning against aachen 2-1 on saturday .
but rummenigge is fully aware that bayern is not alone . " i am under the impression that the clubs which provided lots of national players for the world cup -lrb- this summer -rrb- are now paying the bill , " he wrote in bayern munich 's fan magazine .
" it 's no coincidence that clubs like bayern , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen are n't , or ca n't be , at their best . " thi n k more of the top clubs , says rumme n igge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld 's jonas kamper unleashed bayern critique the bundesliga campaign got its wheels rolling again on aug .
11 , five weeks after the world cup concluded .
rummenigge , a great international striker in his own right , only has to take a glance at other european leagues to make his point . spain 's primera division re-started two weeks after the bundesliga , while the serie a of champions italy held off until sept .
9 . for rummenigge , the vacation and the time for preparation before the season kick-off were " too short . "
but he also did not hesitate in lashing out at the national players who earn their money with bayern munich . " in the future , we will demand that these players give 100 percent to bayern munich just like they did at the world cup , " he told the munich az newspaper , making reference to players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- germany -rrb- and willy sagnol -lrb- france -rrb- .
" we will observe very closely who is ready to do this and who is n't .

failing to meet high expectations , bayern munich 's karl-heinz rummenigge asks for mercy from the league . the first two matches ended in victory , but after a home draw to nuremberg and an away loss to arminia bielefeld , the bosses at bayern munich are looking for answers as to why their side does n't sit atop the league standings .
is coach felix magath to blame for not instilling enough fire into his star ensemble ? he heard plenty of complaining from bayern 's front office head 's karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer this week about him failing to motivate the troops .
when magath then declared that he presumed his boys would " be successful " against newly-promoted side aachen , general manager uli hoeness snapped back that he did n't expect a draw against a promoted team in front of 70,000 supporters . such are the worries for the bundesliga 's most successful team , which did end up winning against aachen 2-1 on saturday .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .

one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .

germany 's best soccer clubs have stumbled out of the starting block this season .
failing to meet high expectations , bayern munich 's karl-heinz rummenigge asks for mercy from the league . the first two matches ended in victory , but after a home draw to nuremberg and an away loss to arminia bielefeld , the bosses at bayern munich are looking for answers as to why their side does n't sit atop the league standings .
is coach felix magath to blame for not instilling enough fire into his star ensemble ? he heard plenty of complaining from bayern 's front office head 's karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer this week about him failing to motivate the troops .
when magath then declared that he presumed his boys would " be successful " against newly-promoted side aachen , general manager uli hoeness snapped back that he did n't expect a draw against a promoted team in front of 70,000 supporters . such are the worries for the bundesliga 's most successful team , which did end up winning against aachen 2-1 on saturday .
but rummenigge is fully aware that bayern is not alone . " i am under the impression that the clubs which provided lots of national players for the world cup -lrb- this summer -rrb- are now paying the bill , " he wrote in bayern munich 's fan magazine .
" it 's no coincidence that clubs like bayern , werder bremen , hamburg sv and bayer leverkusen are n't , or ca n't be , at their best . " thi n k more of the top clubs , says rumme n igge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld 's jonas kamper unleashed bayern critique the bundesliga campaign got its wheels rolling again on aug .
11 , five weeks after the world cup concluded .
rummenigge , a great international striker in his own right , only has to take a glance at other european leagues to make his point . spain 's primera division re-started two weeks after the bundesliga , while the serie a of champions italy held off until sept .
9 . for rummenigge , the vacation and the time for preparation before the season kick-off were " too short . "
but he also did not hesitate in lashing out at the national players who earn their money with bayern munich . " in the future , we will demand that these players give 100 percent to bayern munich just like they did at the world cup , " he told the munich az newspaper , making reference to players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- germany -rrb- and willy sagnol -lrb- france -rrb- .
" we will observe very closely who is ready to do this and who is n't . " he feels the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- should consider whether or not to start the season later after the big international competitions so that field of competition remained level . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and hamburg out of german cup big upsets in the german cup on saturday : two of germany 's champions league participants lose to third-division opponents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .
and these simply can not be tolerated by a democracy . marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de el masri kidnappers identified three cia agents strongly suspected of having abducted a german citizen national have been identified .

" the aim of this reform is to uphold switzerland 's humanitarian tradition while at the same time halting abuses , " blocher said in a recent speech . dema n di n g docume n tatio n like some of his european counterparts , blocher - a politician from the right-wing swiss people 's party - claims that many document-less asylum seekers turn up empty-handed deliberately to make it more difficult to send them home or investigate claims of persecution . to counter such alleged trickery , the new law would require all asylum seekers to present documents within 48 hours of making a claim , and severely restrict applications from people who can not present any identification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without proper documents , it will be hard for people to get past this sign in the future that key plank of the reform has sparked strong debate .
critics - including the un refugee agency - argue that it is often impossible or too risky for people who face a threat to get documents from their home authorities before fleeing .
international refugee rules , which have been in place since 1951 , say that such individuals should not be shut out of the system . blocher has noted that the new law nonetheless contains safeguards for those who are " clearly " refugees and can provide a " plausible " explanation for their lack of documents . more restrictio n the new rules would also cement tight restrictions on financial support for rejected asylum seekers who have been in place for two years .
authorities would be able to place " recalcitrant " foreigners in detention for 18 months - rather than the current nine months - prior to deportation to ensure they do not go underground , and to encourage them to leave . blocher has said that it is essential to streamline the system , cut costs and reduce the temptation to make spurious asylum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss cities , including the capital bern -lrb- pictured -rrb- , are not exactly swamped with asylum seekers but critics counter that switzerland does not need a crackdown , because it is far from being " swamped " : 18,844 people applied for asylum in 2005 , one of the lowest numbers in almost two decades .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .

dw-world.de uncovered a few tourist traps . munich 's oktoberfest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantity does n't mean quality the world 's largest beer festival is a huge tourist draw , but it 's really a very ordinary german celebration , just overblown .
instead of only a few hundred of tipsy revellers , there are thousands of smashed ones .
and they 're not just consuming huge vats of the golden ale , but hearty cholesterol bombs such as bavarian ox tails and white sausages doused with generous portions of sweet mustard .
alas , there 's better beer to be found elsewhere .
after all , it 's the quality , not quantity that counts . hamburg 's reeperbahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's famed reeperbahn oozes with sex long-recognized by the world 's sailors as a place not to be missed , the beatles added to its notoriety in the early 1960s .
drunkards from the world over spill out onto the nightclub strip in st. pauli 's red light district .
sex is openly for sale there - on the street , ladies with bare chests , entice patrons to their establishments . anyone seeking a bit of peace and quiet should make sure not to inadvertently turn into davidstrasse -lrb- david street -rrb- , where the ladies of the night thrust themselves at passersby .
even female tourists headed in the direction of the harbor should n't tarry too long .
they risk being told to clear off . königssee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee is too overcrowded for an idyllic retreat there 's always something happening at königssee , or king 's lake , in the bavarian alps , and you 'll probably need to dig deep into your pockets for it .
besides paying ubiquitous parking fees , plenty of bavarian souvenir shops sell trinkets and kitsch at high prices , and enough restaurants serve mediocre fare at even more exorbitant prices .
in the summer , it 's so overcrowded that having even a dreamy , reflective moment at the lakeside is unthinkable .
for the ordinary , standard cruise to the hyped up town st. bartholomä , expect to pay way too much to experience more of the same endured by other suckers 20 years ago .
der drachenfels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no need to take the mountain railway for a spectacular view the drachenfels , or dragon 's rock , is the best known of the seven mountains in the hinterlands of königswinter , near germany 's former capital , bonn .
according to legend , siegfried of the epic poem nibelungenlied -lrb- song of the nibelungen -rrb- lived in a mountainous cave and slaughtered a dragon .
after bathing in the monster 's blood , he became invincible .
apparently the drachenfels inspired poets such as heinrich heine , but whether it is worth the price to board the mountain railway to the top to see a heap of concrete , is a matter of taste , notwithstanding an overpriced restaurant for day-trippers .
the glorious view can be had , by the way , without scaling the mountain . die drosselgasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drosselgasse is overpriced and overrated for plenty of tourists , germany consists of a visit to neuschwanstein castle , munich 's renowned beer hall hofbräuhaus , and the drosselgasse in rüdesheim , in the land of lorelei .
this supposedly " historic alleyway , the happiest alley in the world " is a loud , shrill , overcrowded pedestrian zone overflowing with pubs and dubious , overpriced wines sold by merchants in a sourpuss mood .
what 's more , the deafening roar of brass instruments is regarded by some as music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.09.2006 opinion : an ambiguous war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of german national khaled el masri , who was allegedly abducted by cia officials who mistook him for a terror suspect , shows germany in a bad light , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . senior public prosecutor august stern confirmed a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitu n g thursday that spanish authorities have handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri . the agents allegedly kidnapped el masri in early 2004 , taking him from macedonia to afghanistan in what has become one of europe 's most controversial rendition cases .
he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .

he claims he spent months behind bars , enduring torture and questioning before he was released . but despite the latest media revelations , the prosecution said it would wait until any kidnappers were officially identified before incorporating new evidence into the case . inevitably , it all creates the impression that the german authorities are less eager to solve the case than they might be if el masri were german rather than lebanese-born . they can certainly be efficient when they want to be - they clearly were n't dragging their feet when they arrested the lebanese-born men suspected of taking part in a plot to bomb german trains in late july . the attempted " suitcase bombings " left german authorities hell-bent on protecting its citizens even at the cost of curtailed personal freedoms .
no sooner had the suspects ' grainy cctv pictures appeared on televisions around the country than police were issuing arrest warrants and hailing the virtues of big-brother-style surveillance technology . media pressure khaled el masri originally came from lebanon , but gained german citizenship several years ago .
he spent five months in detention , but in his case , the german authorities were not , apparently , in any hurry to organize his release . a parliamentary inquiry set up to establish what exactly happened has largely failed to shed light on the affair , not least because the bulk of the files pertaining to the case are classified .
and whenever the hearing finally appears to be getting exciting , any journalists present are requested to leave . even so , it 's been up to the media to reveal many of the most important details in the el masri case .
the german public only read in the papers that public prosecutors in munich already knew the names of the suspected kidnappers - us pilots working for the cia .
but this information has yet to factor in the hearing .
who is pulling the strings here ?
one official with the federal criminal office who gave evidence revealed he had felt instructed by a senior member of the foreign ministry to refrain from researching el masri 's case abroad . ambiguity of war o n terror could it be that berlin was more concerned about its relationship with the us and the cia than about the physical and psychological well-being of a german citizen with the very un-german-sounding name of khaled el masri ?
not only does it seem that german authorities were failing to do their job , it seems as though they were singularly unperturbed by the fate of a german with arab roots . his case illustrates just how ambiguous the international war on terror really is . the state came down hard on the suspected suitcase bombers , wasting no time linking their activities to terrorist networks .
in the wink of an eye , new legislation was drawn up to facilitate the fight .
but the state 's reaction in the case of el masri could not have been more different .
the full extent of the story is only now emerging under pressure from the media rather than from members of parliament determined to discover the truth - and it shows germany in a very bad light . the cia 's abduction of a lebanese-born german citizen and the rapid arrest of suspected terrorists are two sides of the same coin .
one is the shiny side and one is the grimier side .
one shows that germany knows how to deal with terrorists ; the other shows the more sinister consequences of curbing civil rights .

sir malcolm , who won an oscar for the musical score to the bridge on the river kwai film in 1958 , was suffering from a chest infection .
he is most famous for his film scores , composing 132 including whistle down the wind and hobson 's choice .
sir malcolm , who lived near norwich , also composed seven ballets , nine symphonies and two operas .
sir malcolm , one of the most famous composers of the 20th century , leaves behind two sons and one daughter .
he died at the norfolk and norwich hospital .
sir malcolm , you could be responsible for my lifelong love of real music kath , uk anthony day , his companion and carer for the last 23 years , praised sir malcolm as " the most wonderful man " .
" people did n't see the man that i knew because he had frontal lobe dementia over the last few years which slowly developed but , being with him , he was a happy , lovely man who enjoyed his music and enjoyed his life , " he told bbc news .
mr day also paid tribute to sir malcolm 's achievement in winning an oscar for bridge on the river kwai .
" they could n't find anybody else to do the music in time because they wanted to release it to the oscars , " mr day said .
" they gave him 10 days and he managed to write the complete score in 10 days . "
he was a happy , lovely man who enjoyed his music and enjoyed his life anthony day obituary : sir malcolm arnold cellist julian lloyd webber described sir malcolm as a " genius " who was never entirely appreciated .
he said : " i think he was a very , very great composer but uneven in his output .
" because he had humour in his music he was never fully appreciated by the classical establishment . "
lord attenborough , the director and actor , said sir malcolm was a " totally outstanding composer " .
sir malcolm 's music continues to be performed and recorded extensively by leading orchestras both nationally and internationally .
he was awarded the cbe in 1970 .
saturday night was the premier of his version of the three musketeers at the alhambra in bradford .
the performance , which was dedicated to him , went ahead as planned .
your tributes : the world is silent tonight , we have lost one of the " birds " of freedom .. fly with the music you composed and delight the spirit world !
fly !
thank you for your compositions ! julian , monmouth i lived in england in the early sixties and was exposed to bbc radio and to sir malcolm arnold 's music and will always remember that time with a great love .
lavonne morrell , gold beach , oregon usa i was at school in the 70s , all the composers we studied in music lessons were dead except this guy .
rip sir malcolm , you could be responsible for my lifelong love of real music .
kath , uk as one of malcolm 's biographers i got to know him very well in his final years .
in spite of his shameful treatment by the music critics who berated him for being popular , he lived to see virtually all of his output recorded and what is more selling well !
more than any other composer i have known , the music was the man .
he may no longer be with us but listen to his music to know what we have lost .
paul rw jackson , winchester , hampshire malcolm arnold was one of the greatest symphonists that this country has been fortunate to have had .
he combined excellent technique with a vast amount of humour -lrb- humour is a difficult object to achieve in music , unless one wishes to indulge in pure pastiche -rrb- , to create symphonies and other works that will last .
arnolds technique included extremely subtle tonality and key-play within this framework , along with highly original orchestration that is challenging to play -lrb- i played french horn in amateur orchestras and brass bands , and have played in some of arnolds works -rrb- .
the humour , i feel , was not an attempt to cock a snook at the musical establishment , rather it was an expression of a man , a vital man and an insouciant man , confident in his own abilities and not one who fawned on approval , who lived , breathed and sweated music , and was not worried if the sweat produced a bit of a stink .
steve robey , harwich uk a composer of great courage , who stuck to his principles despite the fashionable barrage of atonality .
of composers born in the 1920 's , virtually all gave in to the pressure of the establishment .
malcolm arnold stood firm , and he alone kept the flame of classical music alive until a younger generation came along to breathe new life into the genre once more .
good though his film music is , his concert music is his real contribution .
among many works , maybe the second and fifth symphonies stand out , together with many of the concertos .
he paid a terrible price for standing firm against the tyranny of the establishment , but all who care about serious music should be grateful to him for helping contemporary serious music to survive to our day .
michael holley , goring on thames , reading , uk sir malcolm was a unique voice in dramatic and concert work , with a distinctive bittersweet yet tingling way with his harmony and orchestration .
he was a great musical satirist and educator too , a tonal ' people 's composer ' who nonetheless never dumbed-down .
he also weathered the vortex of many personal challenges in his inner and outer life .
his music increasingly appeals and will continue to do so , no doubt outlasting the canards of a musical establishment who frequently underrated him .
william mccrum , templepatrick , n. ireland when i read the news i took the score for the symphony no.6 from my shelf , the first major score by malcolm arnold i ever studied , which i still regard fondly .
in america , his legacy will certainly be kept alive in his marvellous compositions for wind ensemble , whose orchestrations never cease to amaze .
he will be missed .
bill sisson , onalaska , wisconsin , united states i became enamoured of sir malcolm 's music when in college in wisconsin in the early 1980s .
i was classical music director of the local 10 watt radio station , and a couple who were patrons and supplemented our meagre budget had me over to listen to their $ 20,000 system at various times .
it was on one of those occasions that i heard my first lyrita recording .
it was malcolm arnold 's " dances , " and after that i bought every recording of his works i could lay my hands on , and i was never disappointed .
he may not have been as well known or widely appreciated by americans in general , but among those of us who appreciate the wonders of 20th century british classical , his name has always been a standout .
he will be missed .
victor davis , napa , california , usa " four cornish dances " - shivers down me spine - especially the march where it pictures walking down to the chapel on a sunday morn , methodist style with the sea in the background and a pint of cider waiting at the bar ...
in fact all of his dances .
genius ...
gaz , manchester whistle down the wind , inn of the sixth happiness , bridge over the river kwai , hobson 's choice ... these films were the soundtrack of my 1970s childhood .
rainy sunday afternoons in front of the television watching some of the best films ever made , brilliantly enhanced by his wonderful scores .
malcolm , thank you and god bless you .
david challinor , reigate , surrey a great composer has passed away .
not only was he a true genius of a composer , but also conductor on terrific scores like battle of britain .
may he rest in peace .
joep de bruijn , rotterdam , the netherlands it was , and still is , as a fan of deep purple that brought the name of sir malcolm arnold to my attention in the early 1970 's .
it was his sterling work and willingness to experiment and encourage other young composers and musicians in other ' fields ' of music which gained him my utmost respect .
much respected by the band and fans alike he was an innovator of what would follow .
in 1999 deep purple re-created their " concerto for group and orchestra " at the royal albert hall where sir malcolm arnold had originally helped deep purple bring it all to life in 1970 .
although he was unable to attend on either of the two nights of recording due to illness , his presence was felt in every respect .
jon lord 's dedication to sir malcolm at the time said it all .
trevor mckinstry , carrickfergus , northern ireland malcolm arnold was due to celebrate his 85th birthday this autumn with the first festival dedicated to his work in northampton .
i hope he will be smiling to know of the pleasure his music is giving to audiences in a celebration which will now no doubt be dedicated to his life and wonderfully colourful music .
claire dunham , manchester , england anyone who has ever watched what the papers say on tv will be familiar with his suite of english dances .
kevin , liverpool some eight years ago i was standing on the steps of dunstan hall outside norwich holding a guitar case when an elderly man walking with a stick and a young companion came up the steps .
the older man spoke to me and i misheard him so i asked the young man what he had said - he replied ' he asked if you were playing tonight and hoped you would enjoy your music ' - i later discovered that he was sir malcolm and was amazed he would stop and wish a semi-pro rock musician well !
rock on sir malcolm !
john knowles , norwich uk an extremely fine craftsman of music who suffered unjustified neglect during this life .
time will tell whether it is arnold 's music or that of his serialist detractors that continues to be played and enjoyed by the public .
a crime that he was n't celebrated and better commissioned - the bbc and arts council should hang their heads in shame .
matthew woolhouse , cambridge one of the last true links with what most people think of as ' englishness ' in music is gone .
and with him a great artist , much misunderstood and maligned by the progressive musical establishments of the day during his lifetime .
i think of him as the john betjeman of british music , a people 's composer , one with total integrity , originality and professionalism , and to those who take the trouble of exploring his music more deeply will be revealed unmistakeable genius .
adrian williams , hereford , england now at last he will get the recognition from the serious music community he certainly deserved .
daniel robinson , london i am a member of the birmingham philharmonic orchestra , of whom sir malcolm arnold is the patron .
we performed a concert entirely comprising the works of arnold earlier this year to celebrate his 85th birthday .
we are also to perform peterloo overture and a grand grand festival overture amongst other pieces at a charity concert at symphony hall this coming wednesday 27th september .
personally i love playing arnold 's music and feel that his passing will be greatly felt in our orchestra .
jo stubbs , birmingham , west midlands though we mourn the very sad loss of sir malcolm today we must celebrate , the unique and wonderful legacy of his music left to us .
sir malcolm touched everyone who listened to his music , as he wrote in a very personal yet public manner .
never , ever frightened of writing a ' good tune ' , his music was full of his humanity , warmth and most importantly fun .
we should be all very thankful that sir malcolm was given to us and we must all celebrate his birthday this year as he would have wanted with lots of concerts of his wonderful music .
god bless sir malcolm and many , many thanks to anthony day for his untiring help and support to sir malcolm in his last years .
lawrie dunn , burnham on sea , somerset a true gent of music who has left a great legacy .
from wonderful film music to the inspired guitar concerto he will be sadly missed but forever remembered .
john elliott , york , uk sir malcolm arnold was president of rochdale youth orchestra , and until they left to go to university , my two youngest daughters played in it for several years .
i was always impressed that sir malcolm took on the patronage of what would seem to many to be an insignificant , small town orchestra .
he attended many concerts in spite of age and failing health , and that never failed to impress me , that a world renowned musician and composer would take the trouble to do that .
i think that he was an innovative and interesting composer , and i am sorry to hear of his passing .
sonia wilson , rochdale , england one of my fondest memories of the proms was of malcolm arnold conducting britten 's young person 's guide to the orchestra .
he was almost bent double coaxing the most out of the orchestra - no mean feat for a man of his physique - and clearly having a wonderful time himself .
as , indeed , were we prommers !
david brooks , redmond , wa , 98053 i was fortunate enough to meet malcolm arnold a number of years ' ago when the bbc philharmonic were performing some of his works .
i remember his almost equal pride over his extremely " loud " ties and the fact that few critics had noticed that a movement in his -lrb- i think -rrb- sixth symphony had been composed in strict serialist mode .
a warm , witty and funny man who leaves an astonishing and under-rated body of work .
though his film scores were wonderful , we should not forget the quality of his concert music .
steve rouse , manchester , england i am a supporter / staff member of rochdale youth orchestra , of which sir malcolm was the president .
we are sorry to hear of his passing .
sian , rochdale , lancs i am a clarinettist who has played some of malcolm arnold 's work ... which is some of the most challenging and yet most rewarding i have worked on .
he was a great composer and knew my instrument well .
eleanor smith , edinburgh i do n't know of anyone who can not whistle the theme to bridge over the river kwai .
what an achievement to do the whole score in 10 days !

he died at the norfolk and norwich hospital .
sir malcolm , you could be responsible for my lifelong love of real music kath , uk anthony day , his companion and carer for the last 23 years , praised sir malcolm as " the most wonderful man " .
" people did n't see the man that i knew because he had frontal lobe dementia over the last few years which slowly developed but , being with him , he was a happy , lovely man who enjoyed his music and enjoyed his life , " he told bbc news .
mr day also paid tribute to sir malcolm 's achievement in winning an oscar for bridge on the river kwai .
" they could n't find anybody else to do the music in time because they wanted to release it to the oscars , " mr day said .
" they gave him 10 days and he managed to write the complete score in 10 days . "
he was a happy , lovely man who enjoyed his music and enjoyed his life anthony day obituary : sir malcolm arnold cellist julian lloyd webber described sir malcolm as a " genius " who was never entirely appreciated .
he said : " i think he was a very , very great composer but uneven in his output .

lord attenborough , the director and actor , said sir malcolm was a " totally outstanding composer " .
sir malcolm 's music continues to be performed and recorded extensively by leading orchestras both nationally and internationally .
he was awarded the cbe in 1970 .
saturday night was the premier of his version of the three musketeers at the alhambra in bradford .
the performance , which was dedicated to him , went ahead as planned .
your tributes : the world is silent tonight , we have lost one of the " birds " of freedom .. fly with the music you composed and delight the spirit world !
fly !
thank you for your compositions ! julian , monmouth i lived in england in the early sixties and was exposed to bbc radio and to sir malcolm arnold 's music and will always remember that time with a great love .
lavonne morrell , gold beach , oregon usa i was at school in the 70s , all the composers we studied in music lessons were dead except this guy .
rip sir malcolm , you could be responsible for my lifelong love of real music .
kath , uk as one of malcolm 's biographers i got to know him very well in his final years .
in spite of his shameful treatment by the music critics who berated him for being popular , he lived to see virtually all of his output recorded and what is more selling well !
more than any other composer i have known , the music was the man .
he may no longer be with us but listen to his music to know what we have lost .
paul rw jackson , winchester , hampshire malcolm arnold was one of the greatest symphonists that this country has been fortunate to have had .
he combined excellent technique with a vast amount of humour -lrb- humour is a difficult object to achieve in music , unless one wishes to indulge in pure pastiche -rrb- , to create symphonies and other works that will last .
arnolds technique included extremely subtle tonality and key-play within this framework , along with highly original orchestration that is challenging to play -lrb- i played french horn in amateur orchestras and brass bands , and have played in some of arnolds works -rrb- .
the humour , i feel , was not an attempt to cock a snook at the musical establishment , rather it was an expression of a man , a vital man and an insouciant man , confident in his own abilities and not one who fawned on approval , who lived , breathed and sweated music , and was not worried if the sweat produced a bit of a stink .
steve robey , harwich uk a composer of great courage , who stuck to his principles despite the fashionable barrage of atonality .
of composers born in the 1920 's , virtually all gave in to the pressure of the establishment .
malcolm arnold stood firm , and he alone kept the flame of classical music alive until a younger generation came along to breathe new life into the genre once more .
good though his film music is , his concert music is his real contribution .
among many works , maybe the second and fifth symphonies stand out , together with many of the concertos .
he paid a terrible price for standing firm against the tyranny of the establishment , but all who care about serious music should be grateful to him for helping contemporary serious music to survive to our day .
michael holley , goring on thames , reading , uk sir malcolm was a unique voice in dramatic and concert work , with a distinctive bittersweet yet tingling way with his harmony and orchestration .
he was a great musical satirist and educator too , a tonal ' people 's composer ' who nonetheless never dumbed-down .
he also weathered the vortex of many personal challenges in his inner and outer life .
his music increasingly appeals and will continue to do so , no doubt outlasting the canards of a musical establishment who frequently underrated him .
william mccrum , templepatrick , n. ireland when i read the news i took the score for the symphony no.6 from my shelf , the first major score by malcolm arnold i ever studied , which i still regard fondly .
in america , his legacy will certainly be kept alive in his marvellous compositions for wind ensemble , whose orchestrations never cease to amaze .
he will be missed .
bill sisson , onalaska , wisconsin , united states i became enamoured of sir malcolm 's music when in college in wisconsin in the early 1980s .
i was classical music director of the local 10 watt radio station , and a couple who were patrons and supplemented our meagre budget had me over to listen to their $ 20,000 system at various times .
it was on one of those occasions that i heard my first lyrita recording .
it was malcolm arnold 's " dances , " and after that i bought every recording of his works i could lay my hands on , and i was never disappointed .
he may not have been as well known or widely appreciated by americans in general , but among those of us who appreciate the wonders of 20th century british classical , his name has always been a standout .
he will be missed .

malcolm , thank you and god bless you .
david challinor , reigate , surrey a great composer has passed away .
not only was he a true genius of a composer , but also conductor on terrific scores like battle of britain .
may he rest in peace .
joep de bruijn , rotterdam , the netherlands it was , and still is , as a fan of deep purple that brought the name of sir malcolm arnold to my attention in the early 1970 's .
it was his sterling work and willingness to experiment and encourage other young composers and musicians in other ' fields ' of music which gained him my utmost respect .
much respected by the band and fans alike he was an innovator of what would follow .
in 1999 deep purple re-created their " concerto for group and orchestra " at the royal albert hall where sir malcolm arnold had originally helped deep purple bring it all to life in 1970 .
although he was unable to attend on either of the two nights of recording due to illness , his presence was felt in every respect .
jon lord 's dedication to sir malcolm at the time said it all .
trevor mckinstry , carrickfergus , northern ireland malcolm arnold was due to celebrate his 85th birthday this autumn with the first festival dedicated to his work in northampton .
i hope he will be smiling to know of the pleasure his music is giving to audiences in a celebration which will now no doubt be dedicated to his life and wonderfully colourful music .

the older man spoke to me and i misheard him so i asked the young man what he had said - he replied ' he asked if you were playing tonight and hoped you would enjoy your music ' - i later discovered that he was sir malcolm and was amazed he would stop and wish a semi-pro rock musician well !
rock on sir malcolm !
john knowles , norwich uk an extremely fine craftsman of music who suffered unjustified neglect during this life .

matthew woolhouse , cambridge one of the last true links with what most people think of as ' englishness ' in music is gone .

i think of him as the john betjeman of british music , a people 's composer , one with total integrity , originality and professionalism , and to those who take the trouble of exploring his music more deeply will be revealed unmistakeable genius .
adrian williams , hereford , england now at last he will get the recognition from the serious music community he certainly deserved .
daniel robinson , london i am a member of the birmingham philharmonic orchestra , of whom sir malcolm arnold is the patron .
we performed a concert entirely comprising the works of arnold earlier this year to celebrate his 85th birthday .
we are also to perform peterloo overture and a grand grand festival overture amongst other pieces at a charity concert at symphony hall this coming wednesday 27th september .
personally i love playing arnold 's music and feel that his passing will be greatly felt in our orchestra .
jo stubbs , birmingham , west midlands though we mourn the very sad loss of sir malcolm today we must celebrate , the unique and wonderful legacy of his music left to us .
sir malcolm touched everyone who listened to his music , as he wrote in a very personal yet public manner .
never , ever frightened of writing a ' good tune ' , his music was full of his humanity , warmth and most importantly fun .
we should be all very thankful that sir malcolm was given to us and we must all celebrate his birthday this year as he would have wanted with lots of concerts of his wonderful music .
god bless sir malcolm and many , many thanks to anthony day for his untiring help and support to sir malcolm in his last years .

john elliott , york , uk sir malcolm arnold was president of rochdale youth orchestra , and until they left to go to university , my two youngest daughters played in it for several years .
i was always impressed that sir malcolm took on the patronage of what would seem to many to be an insignificant , small town orchestra .
he attended many concerts in spite of age and failing health , and that never failed to impress me , that a world renowned musician and composer would take the trouble to do that .
i think that he was an innovative and interesting composer , and i am sorry to hear of his passing .
sonia wilson , rochdale , england one of my fondest memories of the proms was of malcolm arnold conducting britten 's young person 's guide to the orchestra .
he was almost bent double coaxing the most out of the orchestra - no mean feat for a man of his physique - and clearly having a wonderful time himself .
as , indeed , were we prommers !
david brooks , redmond , wa , 98053 i was fortunate enough to meet malcolm arnold a number of years ' ago when the bbc philharmonic were performing some of his works .
i remember his almost equal pride over his extremely " loud " ties and the fact that few critics had noticed that a movement in his -lrb- i think -rrb- sixth symphony had been composed in strict serialist mode .
a warm , witty and funny man who leaves an astonishing and under-rated body of work .

paul rw jackson , winchester , hampshire malcolm arnold was one of the greatest symphonists that this country has been fortunate to have had .
he combined excellent technique with a vast amount of humour -lrb- humour is a difficult object to achieve in music , unless one wishes to indulge in pure pastiche -rrb- , to create symphonies and other works that will last .
arnolds technique included extremely subtle tonality and key-play within this framework , along with highly original orchestration that is challenging to play -lrb- i played french horn in amateur orchestras and brass bands , and have played in some of arnolds works -rrb- .
the humour , i feel , was not an attempt to cock a snook at the musical establishment , rather it was an expression of a man , a vital man and an insouciant man , confident in his own abilities and not one who fawned on approval , who lived , breathed and sweated music , and was not worried if the sweat produced a bit of a stink .
steve robey , harwich uk a composer of great courage , who stuck to his principles despite the fashionable barrage of atonality .
of composers born in the 1920 's , virtually all gave in to the pressure of the establishment .
malcolm arnold stood firm , and he alone kept the flame of classical music alive until a younger generation came along to breathe new life into the genre once more .
good though his film music is , his concert music is his real contribution .
among many works , maybe the second and fifth symphonies stand out , together with many of the concertos .
he paid a terrible price for standing firm against the tyranny of the establishment , but all who care about serious music should be grateful to him for helping contemporary serious music to survive to our day .
michael holley , goring on thames , reading , uk sir malcolm was a unique voice in dramatic and concert work , with a distinctive bittersweet yet tingling way with his harmony and orchestration .
he was a great musical satirist and educator too , a tonal ' people 's composer ' who nonetheless never dumbed-down .
he also weathered the vortex of many personal challenges in his inner and outer life .
his music increasingly appeals and will continue to do so , no doubt outlasting the canards of a musical establishment who frequently underrated him .
william mccrum , templepatrick , n. ireland when i read the news i took the score for the symphony no.6 from my shelf , the first major score by malcolm arnold i ever studied , which i still regard fondly .
in america , his legacy will certainly be kept alive in his marvellous compositions for wind ensemble , whose orchestrations never cease to amaze .
he will be missed .
bill sisson , onalaska , wisconsin , united states i became enamoured of sir malcolm 's music when in college in wisconsin in the early 1980s .
i was classical music director of the local 10 watt radio station , and a couple who were patrons and supplemented our meagre budget had me over to listen to their $ 20,000 system at various times .
it was on one of those occasions that i heard my first lyrita recording .
it was malcolm arnold 's " dances , " and after that i bought every recording of his works i could lay my hands on , and i was never disappointed .
he may not have been as well known or widely appreciated by americans in general , but among those of us who appreciate the wonders of 20th century british classical , his name has always been a standout .
he will be missed .

joep de bruijn , rotterdam , the netherlands it was , and still is , as a fan of deep purple that brought the name of sir malcolm arnold to my attention in the early 1970 's .
it was his sterling work and willingness to experiment and encourage other young composers and musicians in other ' fields ' of music which gained him my utmost respect .
much respected by the band and fans alike he was an innovator of what would follow .
in 1999 deep purple re-created their " concerto for group and orchestra " at the royal albert hall where sir malcolm arnold had originally helped deep purple bring it all to life in 1970 .
although he was unable to attend on either of the two nights of recording due to illness , his presence was felt in every respect .
jon lord 's dedication to sir malcolm at the time said it all .
trevor mckinstry , carrickfergus , northern ireland malcolm arnold was due to celebrate his 85th birthday this autumn with the first festival dedicated to his work in northampton .

rock on sir malcolm !
john knowles , norwich uk an extremely fine craftsman of music who suffered unjustified neglect during this life .

sir malcolm touched everyone who listened to his music , as he wrote in a very personal yet public manner .
never , ever frightened of writing a ' good tune ' , his music was full of his humanity , warmth and most importantly fun .
we should be all very thankful that sir malcolm was given to us and we must all celebrate his birthday this year as he would have wanted with lots of concerts of his wonderful music .

he attended many concerts in spite of age and failing health , and that never failed to impress me , that a world renowned musician and composer would take the trouble to do that .

gaz , manchester whistle down the wind , inn of the sixth happiness , bridge over the river kwai , hobson 's choice ... these films were the soundtrack of my 1970s childhood .
rainy sunday afternoons in front of the television watching some of the best films ever made , brilliantly enhanced by his wonderful scores .
malcolm , thank you and god bless you .
david challinor , reigate , surrey a great composer has passed away .
not only was he a true genius of a composer , but also conductor on terrific scores like battle of britain .
may he rest in peace .
joep de bruijn , rotterdam , the netherlands it was , and still is , as a fan of deep purple that brought the name of sir malcolm arnold to my attention in the early 1970 's .
it was his sterling work and willingness to experiment and encourage other young composers and musicians in other ' fields ' of music which gained him my utmost respect .
much respected by the band and fans alike he was an innovator of what would follow .
in 1999 deep purple re-created their " concerto for group and orchestra " at the royal albert hall where sir malcolm arnold had originally helped deep purple bring it all to life in 1970 .
although he was unable to attend on either of the two nights of recording due to illness , his presence was felt in every respect .
jon lord 's dedication to sir malcolm at the time said it all .
trevor mckinstry , carrickfergus , northern ireland malcolm arnold was due to celebrate his 85th birthday this autumn with the first festival dedicated to his work in northampton .
i hope he will be smiling to know of the pleasure his music is giving to audiences in a celebration which will now no doubt be dedicated to his life and wonderfully colourful music .
claire dunham , manchester , england anyone who has ever watched what the papers say on tv will be familiar with his suite of english dances .
kevin , liverpool some eight years ago i was standing on the steps of dunstan hall outside norwich holding a guitar case when an elderly man walking with a stick and a young companion came up the steps .
the older man spoke to me and i misheard him so i asked the young man what he had said - he replied ' he asked if you were playing tonight and hoped you would enjoy your music ' - i later discovered that he was sir malcolm and was amazed he would stop and wish a semi-pro rock musician well !
rock on sir malcolm !
john knowles , norwich uk an extremely fine craftsman of music who suffered unjustified neglect during this life .
time will tell whether it is arnold 's music or that of his serialist detractors that continues to be played and enjoyed by the public .
a crime that he was n't celebrated and better commissioned - the bbc and arts council should hang their heads in shame .
matthew woolhouse , cambridge one of the last true links with what most people think of as ' englishness ' in music is gone .
and with him a great artist , much misunderstood and maligned by the progressive musical establishments of the day during his lifetime .
i think of him as the john betjeman of british music , a people 's composer , one with total integrity , originality and professionalism , and to those who take the trouble of exploring his music more deeply will be revealed unmistakeable genius .
adrian williams , hereford , england now at last he will get the recognition from the serious music community he certainly deserved .
daniel robinson , london i am a member of the birmingham philharmonic orchestra , of whom sir malcolm arnold is the patron .
we performed a concert entirely comprising the works of arnold earlier this year to celebrate his 85th birthday .
we are also to perform peterloo overture and a grand grand festival overture amongst other pieces at a charity concert at symphony hall this coming wednesday 27th september .
personally i love playing arnold 's music and feel that his passing will be greatly felt in our orchestra .
jo stubbs , birmingham , west midlands though we mourn the very sad loss of sir malcolm today we must celebrate , the unique and wonderful legacy of his music left to us .
sir malcolm touched everyone who listened to his music , as he wrote in a very personal yet public manner .
never , ever frightened of writing a ' good tune ' , his music was full of his humanity , warmth and most importantly fun .
we should be all very thankful that sir malcolm was given to us and we must all celebrate his birthday this year as he would have wanted with lots of concerts of his wonderful music .
god bless sir malcolm and many , many thanks to anthony day for his untiring help and support to sir malcolm in his last years .
lawrie dunn , burnham on sea , somerset a true gent of music who has left a great legacy .
from wonderful film music to the inspired guitar concerto he will be sadly missed but forever remembered .
john elliott , york , uk sir malcolm arnold was president of rochdale youth orchestra , and until they left to go to university , my two youngest daughters played in it for several years .
i was always impressed that sir malcolm took on the patronage of what would seem to many to be an insignificant , small town orchestra .
he attended many concerts in spite of age and failing health , and that never failed to impress me , that a world renowned musician and composer would take the trouble to do that .
i think that he was an innovative and interesting composer , and i am sorry to hear of his passing .
sonia wilson , rochdale , england one of my fondest memories of the proms was of malcolm arnold conducting britten 's young person 's guide to the orchestra .
he was almost bent double coaxing the most out of the orchestra - no mean feat for a man of his physique - and clearly having a wonderful time himself .
as , indeed , were we prommers !
david brooks , redmond , wa , 98053 i was fortunate enough to meet malcolm arnold a number of years ' ago when the bbc philharmonic were performing some of his works .
i remember his almost equal pride over his extremely " loud " ties and the fact that few critics had noticed that a movement in his -lrb- i think -rrb- sixth symphony had been composed in strict serialist mode .
a warm , witty and funny man who leaves an astonishing and under-rated body of work .
though his film scores were wonderful , we should not forget the quality of his concert music .
steve rouse , manchester , england i am a supporter / staff member of rochdale youth orchestra , of which sir malcolm was the president .
we are sorry to hear of his passing .
sian , rochdale , lancs i am a clarinettist who has played some of malcolm arnold 's work ... which is some of the most challenging and yet most rewarding i have worked on .
he was a great composer and knew my instrument well .
eleanor smith , edinburgh i do n't know of anyone who can not whistle the theme to bridge over the river kwai .
what an achievement to do the whole score in 10 days !
a truly amazing man .

we put to him the best questions you sent in to us about the playstation 3 , xbox 360 and nintendo wii , which will be battling it out for dominance in your living room this christmas .
q : a question i would like to ask sony is . " why did they only push back the release date for europe , but still go ahead with the original release date for the usa and asia ?
why not put the release date back for the whole world ? "
rob garcia , malaga , spain a : phil harrison , head of worldwide studios at sony computer entertainment europe says that sony decided to delay in europe as it is the most complex market for them to distribute consoles .
the european region is made of 104 countries that have different safety standards and different languages .
the large number of countries makes it logistically difficult to distribute the consoles , he said .
in contrast , mr harrison said , north america consists of three countries with 2 main languages .
in addition 80 % of all sales come from 20 chains of shops making it easier to distribute the consoles .
geographically it is also closer to china where the consoles are assembled .
japan , the other region that will see ps3s on shelves in november , is also a more homogenous market , he said .
like america it is geographically closer to the factory .
" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .
mr harrison said that he also personally regrets the decision , as he will no longer be able to have a ps3 in time for christmas as sony is sending all production models out to their customers .
the xbox 360 stand proved popular with gamers q : will the new ps3 be backwards compatible with ps2 games ?
michelle , doncaster , england a : yes .
the ps3 has software that allows it to play 99 % of playstation 1 and 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- discs .
in addition , ken kutaragi , the head of playstation at sony , has said that ps3 owners will be able to download older playstation titles from the internet using sony 's new online service .
" game saves " on ps2 memory cards can be uploaded to the ps3 using an adaptor so that you can continue to play an older game from the same stage as you left it on your ps2 .
q : with the delayed european launch of the ps3 , will this cause a reduction in the price for european consumers to match the wait ?
david , london a : phil harrison said there would be no change to the us or the european prices for the ps3 .
the recent price drop in japan was to make sure that the price was " in line " with the price people would pay in the rest of the world , he said .
when prices were set , he said , sony went for " magic figures " : under $ 500 and under 500 euros , for the 20gb console .
the japanese price was derived from these figures .
however , he said , that had made a price that was too expensive for japanese gamers and they had been forced to drop the price .
q : will the wii and ps3 be region-free ?
or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .
q : is there any chance of the rumble function being reincluded in the controller ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : sony has said the rumble function , which makes ps2 controllers vibrate in response to the onscreen action , will not be included in future ps3 controllers .
phil harrison said that the decision to not include the feature was two-fold .
first , he said , it was too expensive to keep the dual shock controller , as they were known , and include the motion sensors and tilt function in the new controller .
the new functionality allows gamers to control what is happening on screen by moving the controller in the air .
he also said that more importantly the new controller gave games designers more freedom to create new and interesting games .
" giving the user more control over the game is a much better feature than a reaction from the console that they can not control , " he said .
sony were hoping to impress people with the playstation 3 q : how will the ps3 be upgradeable -lrb- if at all -rrb- ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : the ps3 will be upgradeable in two ways .
first the firmware , which is similar to a computers operating system , will be able to be updated over the internet .
software too can be downloaded from the net , allowing users to keep up to date with new features and add-ons for games .
the hardware , whilst not directly upgradeable , supports a large number of industry-standard interfaces such as usb , bluetooth and flash memory cards .
therefore a large number of peripherals , that sony expect will be made by third party companies , can be easily plugged into the ps3 .
so for example the hard disc could be easily upgraded by buying an external usb drive .
q : with the imminent release of the wii , and the ps3 next march , competition finally seems to be hotting up .
is there a buzz at tgs this year and any indication of who may come out on top in japan ?
steven bagley , walsall , west midlands a : unfortunately nintendo did not attend the tokyo games show , preferring to hold its own events instead .
however , there was still a lot of talk about the wii and there is a general enthusiasm here about its release .
nintendo have a strong following in japan and their unorthodox controller has got many games developers and gamers excited .
the xbox 360 , which has been on the market for nearly a year , is making inroads into the japanese market .
microsoft has started to develop and release titles specifically for japanese gamers , something they did not do with the original xbox .
on the microsoft stand there were two-hour queues to play blue dragon and lost odyssey , the latest role playing games .
these games and the new price of the xbox 360 mean that people are now taking microsoft more seriously in japan .
however , tgs has been sony 's show in many ways .
they had the largest presence here and had throngs of people eager to try out the ps3 and a list of new titles .
the price reduction in japan means that the console is now more affordable , but it is still more expensive than both the wii and xbox 360 .
the delays have also meant that some gamers have already bought an xbox 360 instead .
at the moment it is impossible to forecast who will win the console battle with two consoles still due for release but it will be a story that the technology team will be following closely over the next year .
q : how will the online component of the ps3 work ?
david blair , stockport england a : the ps3 is pretty much plug and play .
if you have a broadband connection you can plug the ps3 into your modem or router and you are online .
if you have wireless , the ps3 will connect .
using the playstation network platform , as it is known , you can play games with people from around the world , have conversations using the inbuilt video and instant messaging systems or download games and software for your ps3 .
the internet connection also allows you to browse the web on the television that your ps3 is plugged in to .
q : what can the 360 offer someone , like myself , who does n't really like fps , driving , sports or general online gaming which seem to make up most of the 360 titles out there ?
mark , newport , wales a : xbox are releasing a huge number of new games .
peter moore , the head of xbox , said that there would be 110 xbox 360 titles by the end of the year .
within this line up are different styles of game including role-playing games and quirky social games like viva piñata .
in the game , players take control of a garden that grows in real time .
with proper maintenance the garden attracts new creatures , or piñatas .
the game has a strong social element with players able to trade objects and animals from their garden , many of which can be customised , over the internet .
microsoft will be making a series of announcements about their new games at their event x06 in barcelona next week .
" watch this space , " said mr moore .
q : how long are xbox games going to be manufactured , and when will more xbox 360 games be released .
it seems at the moment that the ground is very thin .
matt owen , kent , uk a : although many of the teams that comprise microsoft game studios started making games for the xbox 360 when it was released , some continue to publish xbox titles .
peter moore said that he expects this to continue throughout 2007 .
after that , third party companies will probably make any xbox titles , he said .
" i think as long as people keep playing them , publishers will keep making them , " mr moore said .
q : when will xbox 360 games be keyboard and mouse compatible -lrb- or will they ever -rrb- ?
a : no .
peter moore said that there would never be a mouse and keyboard attachment for the xbox 360 .
" its not meant to be a productivity device , it 's -lsb- the xbox 360 -rsb- about fun , " he said .
q : i 'd like to know if the quality of graphics and the gameplay of the ps3 are a lot better than the xbox 360 or if it pretty much feels the same when playing .
jeremy , ottawa , canada a : at the moment many ps3 games are still in development and therefore it is difficult to compare the two .
the ps3 games i have played - including resistance : fall of man , gran turismo hd and lair - do not play any better than many xbox 360 titles on show .
both are slick and have amazing visuals and gameplay .
at the moment , the ps3 games are not able to take full advantage of the cell processor so future games may look and play differently .
i would expect that the games for both the xbox 360 and ps3 will continue to improve and surprise gamers as the consoles mature , in the same way that games improved for the original xbox and ps2 throughout their lives .

" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .
mr harrison said that he also personally regrets the decision , as he will no longer be able to have a ps3 in time for christmas as sony is sending all production models out to their customers .
the xbox 360 stand proved popular with gamers q : will the new ps3 be backwards compatible with ps2 games ?
michelle , doncaster , england a : yes .
the ps3 has software that allows it to play 99 % of playstation 1 and 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- discs .
in addition , ken kutaragi , the head of playstation at sony , has said that ps3 owners will be able to download older playstation titles from the internet using sony 's new online service .
" game saves " on ps2 memory cards can be uploaded to the ps3 using an adaptor so that you can continue to play an older game from the same stage as you left it on your ps2 .
q : with the delayed european launch of the ps3 , will this cause a reduction in the price for european consumers to match the wait ?
david , london a : phil harrison said there would be no change to the us or the european prices for the ps3 .
the recent price drop in japan was to make sure that the price was " in line " with the price people would pay in the rest of the world , he said .
when prices were set , he said , sony went for " magic figures " : under $ 500 and under 500 euros , for the 20gb console .
the japanese price was derived from these figures .
however , he said , that had made a price that was too expensive for japanese gamers and they had been forced to drop the price .
q : will the wii and ps3 be region-free ?
or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .
q : is there any chance of the rumble function being reincluded in the controller ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : sony has said the rumble function , which makes ps2 controllers vibrate in response to the onscreen action , will not be included in future ps3 controllers .
phil harrison said that the decision to not include the feature was two-fold .
first , he said , it was too expensive to keep the dual shock controller , as they were known , and include the motion sensors and tilt function in the new controller .
the new functionality allows gamers to control what is happening on screen by moving the controller in the air .
he also said that more importantly the new controller gave games designers more freedom to create new and interesting games .
" giving the user more control over the game is a much better feature than a reaction from the console that they can not control , " he said .
sony were hoping to impress people with the playstation 3 q : how will the ps3 be upgradeable -lrb- if at all -rrb- ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : the ps3 will be upgradeable in two ways .
first the firmware , which is similar to a computers operating system , will be able to be updated over the internet .
software too can be downloaded from the net , allowing users to keep up to date with new features and add-ons for games .
the hardware , whilst not directly upgradeable , supports a large number of industry-standard interfaces such as usb , bluetooth and flash memory cards .
therefore a large number of peripherals , that sony expect will be made by third party companies , can be easily plugged into the ps3 .
so for example the hard disc could be easily upgraded by buying an external usb drive .
q : with the imminent release of the wii , and the ps3 next march , competition finally seems to be hotting up .
is there a buzz at tgs this year and any indication of who may come out on top in japan ?
steven bagley , walsall , west midlands a : unfortunately nintendo did not attend the tokyo games show , preferring to hold its own events instead .
however , there was still a lot of talk about the wii and there is a general enthusiasm here about its release .
nintendo have a strong following in japan and their unorthodox controller has got many games developers and gamers excited .
the xbox 360 , which has been on the market for nearly a year , is making inroads into the japanese market .
microsoft has started to develop and release titles specifically for japanese gamers , something they did not do with the original xbox .
on the microsoft stand there were two-hour queues to play blue dragon and lost odyssey , the latest role playing games .
these games and the new price of the xbox 360 mean that people are now taking microsoft more seriously in japan .
however , tgs has been sony 's show in many ways .
they had the largest presence here and had throngs of people eager to try out the ps3 and a list of new titles .
the price reduction in japan means that the console is now more affordable , but it is still more expensive than both the wii and xbox 360 .
the delays have also meant that some gamers have already bought an xbox 360 instead .
at the moment it is impossible to forecast who will win the console battle with two consoles still due for release but it will be a story that the technology team will be following closely over the next year .
q : how will the online component of the ps3 work ?
david blair , stockport england a : the ps3 is pretty much plug and play .
if you have a broadband connection you can plug the ps3 into your modem or router and you are online .
if you have wireless , the ps3 will connect .
using the playstation network platform , as it is known , you can play games with people from around the world , have conversations using the inbuilt video and instant messaging systems or download games and software for your ps3 .
the internet connection also allows you to browse the web on the television that your ps3 is plugged in to .
q : what can the 360 offer someone , like myself , who does n't really like fps , driving , sports or general online gaming which seem to make up most of the 360 titles out there ?
mark , newport , wales a : xbox are releasing a huge number of new games .
peter moore , the head of xbox , said that there would be 110 xbox 360 titles by the end of the year .
within this line up are different styles of game including role-playing games and quirky social games like viva piñata .
in the game , players take control of a garden that grows in real time .
with proper maintenance the garden attracts new creatures , or piñatas .
the game has a strong social element with players able to trade objects and animals from their garden , many of which can be customised , over the internet .
microsoft will be making a series of announcements about their new games at their event x06 in barcelona next week .
" watch this space , " said mr moore .
q : how long are xbox games going to be manufactured , and when will more xbox 360 games be released .
it seems at the moment that the ground is very thin .
matt owen , kent , uk a : although many of the teams that comprise microsoft game studios started making games for the xbox 360 when it was released , some continue to publish xbox titles .
peter moore said that he expects this to continue throughout 2007 .
after that , third party companies will probably make any xbox titles , he said .
" i think as long as people keep playing them , publishers will keep making them , " mr moore said .
q : when will xbox 360 games be keyboard and mouse compatible -lrb- or will they ever -rrb- ?
a : no .
peter moore said that there would never be a mouse and keyboard attachment for the xbox 360 .
" its not meant to be a productivity device , it 's -lsb- the xbox 360 -rsb- about fun , " he said .
q : i 'd like to know if the quality of graphics and the gameplay of the ps3 are a lot better than the xbox 360 or if it pretty much feels the same when playing .
jeremy , ottawa , canada a : at the moment many ps3 games are still in development and therefore it is difficult to compare the two .
the ps3 games i have played - including resistance : fall of man , gran turismo hd and lair - do not play any better than many xbox 360 titles on show .
both are slick and have amazing visuals and gameplay .
at the moment , the ps3 games are not able to take full advantage of the cell processor so future games may look and play differently .
i would expect that the games for both the xbox 360 and ps3 will continue to improve and surprise gamers as the consoles mature , in the same way that games improved for the original xbox and ps2 throughout their lives .

we put to him the best questions you sent in to us about the playstation 3 , xbox 360 and nintendo wii , which will be battling it out for dominance in your living room this christmas .
q : a question i would like to ask sony is . " why did they only push back the release date for europe , but still go ahead with the original release date for the usa and asia ?
why not put the release date back for the whole world ? "
rob garcia , malaga , spain a : phil harrison , head of worldwide studios at sony computer entertainment europe says that sony decided to delay in europe as it is the most complex market for them to distribute consoles .
the european region is made of 104 countries that have different safety standards and different languages .
the large number of countries makes it logistically difficult to distribute the consoles , he said .
in contrast , mr harrison said , north america consists of three countries with 2 main languages .
in addition 80 % of all sales come from 20 chains of shops making it easier to distribute the consoles .
geographically it is also closer to china where the consoles are assembled .
japan , the other region that will see ps3s on shelves in november , is also a more homogenous market , he said .
like america it is geographically closer to the factory .
" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .

we put to him the best questions you sent in to us about the playstation 3 , xbox 360 and nintendo wii , which will be battling it out for dominance in your living room this christmas .
q : a question i would like to ask sony is . " why did they only push back the release date for europe , but still go ahead with the original release date for the usa and asia ?
why not put the release date back for the whole world ? "
rob garcia , malaga , spain a : phil harrison , head of worldwide studios at sony computer entertainment europe says that sony decided to delay in europe as it is the most complex market for them to distribute consoles .
the european region is made of 104 countries that have different safety standards and different languages .
the large number of countries makes it logistically difficult to distribute the consoles , he said .
in contrast , mr harrison said , north america consists of three countries with 2 main languages .
in addition 80 % of all sales come from 20 chains of shops making it easier to distribute the consoles .
geographically it is also closer to china where the consoles are assembled .
japan , the other region that will see ps3s on shelves in november , is also a more homogenous market , he said .
like america it is geographically closer to the factory .
" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .
mr harrison said that he also personally regrets the decision , as he will no longer be able to have a ps3 in time for christmas as sony is sending all production models out to their customers .
the xbox 360 stand proved popular with gamers q : will the new ps3 be backwards compatible with ps2 games ?
michelle , doncaster , england a : yes .
the ps3 has software that allows it to play 99 % of playstation 1 and 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- discs .
in addition , ken kutaragi , the head of playstation at sony , has said that ps3 owners will be able to download older playstation titles from the internet using sony 's new online service .
" game saves " on ps2 memory cards can be uploaded to the ps3 using an adaptor so that you can continue to play an older game from the same stage as you left it on your ps2 .
q : with the delayed european launch of the ps3 , will this cause a reduction in the price for european consumers to match the wait ?
david , london a : phil harrison said there would be no change to the us or the european prices for the ps3 .
the recent price drop in japan was to make sure that the price was " in line " with the price people would pay in the rest of the world , he said .
when prices were set , he said , sony went for " magic figures " : under $ 500 and under 500 euros , for the 20gb console .
the japanese price was derived from these figures .
however , he said , that had made a price that was too expensive for japanese gamers and they had been forced to drop the price .
q : will the wii and ps3 be region-free ?
or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .
q : is there any chance of the rumble function being reincluded in the controller ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : sony has said the rumble function , which makes ps2 controllers vibrate in response to the onscreen action , will not be included in future ps3 controllers .
phil harrison said that the decision to not include the feature was two-fold .
first , he said , it was too expensive to keep the dual shock controller , as they were known , and include the motion sensors and tilt function in the new controller .
the new functionality allows gamers to control what is happening on screen by moving the controller in the air .
he also said that more importantly the new controller gave games designers more freedom to create new and interesting games .
" giving the user more control over the game is a much better feature than a reaction from the console that they can not control , " he said .
sony were hoping to impress people with the playstation 3 q : how will the ps3 be upgradeable -lrb- if at all -rrb- ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : the ps3 will be upgradeable in two ways .
first the firmware , which is similar to a computers operating system , will be able to be updated over the internet .
software too can be downloaded from the net , allowing users to keep up to date with new features and add-ons for games .
the hardware , whilst not directly upgradeable , supports a large number of industry-standard interfaces such as usb , bluetooth and flash memory cards .
therefore a large number of peripherals , that sony expect will be made by third party companies , can be easily plugged into the ps3 .
so for example the hard disc could be easily upgraded by buying an external usb drive .
q : with the imminent release of the wii , and the ps3 next march , competition finally seems to be hotting up .
is there a buzz at tgs this year and any indication of who may come out on top in japan ?
steven bagley , walsall , west midlands a : unfortunately nintendo did not attend the tokyo games show , preferring to hold its own events instead .
however , there was still a lot of talk about the wii and there is a general enthusiasm here about its release .
nintendo have a strong following in japan and their unorthodox controller has got many games developers and gamers excited .
the xbox 360 , which has been on the market for nearly a year , is making inroads into the japanese market .
microsoft has started to develop and release titles specifically for japanese gamers , something they did not do with the original xbox .
on the microsoft stand there were two-hour queues to play blue dragon and lost odyssey , the latest role playing games .
these games and the new price of the xbox 360 mean that people are now taking microsoft more seriously in japan .
however , tgs has been sony 's show in many ways .
they had the largest presence here and had throngs of people eager to try out the ps3 and a list of new titles .
the price reduction in japan means that the console is now more affordable , but it is still more expensive than both the wii and xbox 360 .
the delays have also meant that some gamers have already bought an xbox 360 instead .
at the moment it is impossible to forecast who will win the console battle with two consoles still due for release but it will be a story that the technology team will be following closely over the next year .
q : how will the online component of the ps3 work ?
david blair , stockport england a : the ps3 is pretty much plug and play .
if you have a broadband connection you can plug the ps3 into your modem or router and you are online .
if you have wireless , the ps3 will connect .
using the playstation network platform , as it is known , you can play games with people from around the world , have conversations using the inbuilt video and instant messaging systems or download games and software for your ps3 .
the internet connection also allows you to browse the web on the television that your ps3 is plugged in to .
q : what can the 360 offer someone , like myself , who does n't really like fps , driving , sports or general online gaming which seem to make up most of the 360 titles out there ?
mark , newport , wales a : xbox are releasing a huge number of new games .
peter moore , the head of xbox , said that there would be 110 xbox 360 titles by the end of the year .
within this line up are different styles of game including role-playing games and quirky social games like viva piñata .
in the game , players take control of a garden that grows in real time .
with proper maintenance the garden attracts new creatures , or piñatas .
the game has a strong social element with players able to trade objects and animals from their garden , many of which can be customised , over the internet .
microsoft will be making a series of announcements about their new games at their event x06 in barcelona next week .
" watch this space , " said mr moore .
q : how long are xbox games going to be manufactured , and when will more xbox 360 games be released .
it seems at the moment that the ground is very thin .
matt owen , kent , uk a : although many of the teams that comprise microsoft game studios started making games for the xbox 360 when it was released , some continue to publish xbox titles .
peter moore said that he expects this to continue throughout 2007 .
after that , third party companies will probably make any xbox titles , he said .
" i think as long as people keep playing them , publishers will keep making them , " mr moore said .
q : when will xbox 360 games be keyboard and mouse compatible -lrb- or will they ever -rrb- ?
a : no .
peter moore said that there would never be a mouse and keyboard attachment for the xbox 360 .
" its not meant to be a productivity device , it 's -lsb- the xbox 360 -rsb- about fun , " he said .
q : i 'd like to know if the quality of graphics and the gameplay of the ps3 are a lot better than the xbox 360 or if it pretty much feels the same when playing .
jeremy , ottawa , canada a : at the moment many ps3 games are still in development and therefore it is difficult to compare the two .
the ps3 games i have played - including resistance : fall of man , gran turismo hd and lair - do not play any better than many xbox 360 titles on show .
both are slick and have amazing visuals and gameplay .
at the moment , the ps3 games are not able to take full advantage of the cell processor so future games may look and play differently .
i would expect that the games for both the xbox 360 and ps3 will continue to improve and surprise gamers as the consoles mature , in the same way that games improved for the original xbox and ps2 throughout their lives .

at the moment it is impossible to forecast who will win the console battle with two consoles still due for release but it will be a story that the technology team will be following closely over the next year .
q : how will the online component of the ps3 work ?
david blair , stockport england a : the ps3 is pretty much plug and play .
if you have a broadband connection you can plug the ps3 into your modem or router and you are online .
if you have wireless , the ps3 will connect .
using the playstation network platform , as it is known , you can play games with people from around the world , have conversations using the inbuilt video and instant messaging systems or download games and software for your ps3 .
the internet connection also allows you to browse the web on the television that your ps3 is plugged in to .
q : what can the 360 offer someone , like myself , who does n't really like fps , driving , sports or general online gaming which seem to make up most of the 360 titles out there ?
mark , newport , wales a : xbox are releasing a huge number of new games .
peter moore , the head of xbox , said that there would be 110 xbox 360 titles by the end of the year .
within this line up are different styles of game including role-playing games and quirky social games like viva piñata .
in the game , players take control of a garden that grows in real time .
with proper maintenance the garden attracts new creatures , or piñatas .
the game has a strong social element with players able to trade objects and animals from their garden , many of which can be customised , over the internet .
microsoft will be making a series of announcements about their new games at their event x06 in barcelona next week .
" watch this space , " said mr moore .
q : how long are xbox games going to be manufactured , and when will more xbox 360 games be released .
it seems at the moment that the ground is very thin .
matt owen , kent , uk a : although many of the teams that comprise microsoft game studios started making games for the xbox 360 when it was released , some continue to publish xbox titles .
peter moore said that he expects this to continue throughout 2007 .
after that , third party companies will probably make any xbox titles , he said .
" i think as long as people keep playing them , publishers will keep making them , " mr moore said .
q : when will xbox 360 games be keyboard and mouse compatible -lrb- or will they ever -rrb- ?
a : no .
peter moore said that there would never be a mouse and keyboard attachment for the xbox 360 .
" its not meant to be a productivity device , it 's -lsb- the xbox 360 -rsb- about fun , " he said .
q : i 'd like to know if the quality of graphics and the gameplay of the ps3 are a lot better than the xbox 360 or if it pretty much feels the same when playing .
jeremy , ottawa , canada a : at the moment many ps3 games are still in development and therefore it is difficult to compare the two .
the ps3 games i have played - including resistance : fall of man , gran turismo hd and lair - do not play any better than many xbox 360 titles on show .
both are slick and have amazing visuals and gameplay .
at the moment , the ps3 games are not able to take full advantage of the cell processor so future games may look and play differently .
i would expect that the games for both the xbox 360 and ps3 will continue to improve and surprise gamers as the consoles mature , in the same way that games improved for the original xbox and ps2 throughout their lives .

we put to him the best questions you sent in to us about the playstation 3 , xbox 360 and nintendo wii , which will be battling it out for dominance in your living room this christmas .
q : a question i would like to ask sony is . " why did they only push back the release date for europe , but still go ahead with the original release date for the usa and asia ?
why not put the release date back for the whole world ? "
rob garcia , malaga , spain a : phil harrison , head of worldwide studios at sony computer entertainment europe says that sony decided to delay in europe as it is the most complex market for them to distribute consoles .
the european region is made of 104 countries that have different safety standards and different languages .
the large number of countries makes it logistically difficult to distribute the consoles , he said .
in contrast , mr harrison said , north america consists of three countries with 2 main languages .
in addition 80 % of all sales come from 20 chains of shops making it easier to distribute the consoles .
geographically it is also closer to china where the consoles are assembled .
japan , the other region that will see ps3s on shelves in november , is also a more homogenous market , he said .
like america it is geographically closer to the factory .
" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .
mr harrison said that he also personally regrets the decision , as he will no longer be able to have a ps3 in time for christmas as sony is sending all production models out to their customers .
the xbox 360 stand proved popular with gamers q : will the new ps3 be backwards compatible with ps2 games ?
michelle , doncaster , england a : yes .
the ps3 has software that allows it to play 99 % of playstation 1 and 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- discs .
in addition , ken kutaragi , the head of playstation at sony , has said that ps3 owners will be able to download older playstation titles from the internet using sony 's new online service .
" game saves " on ps2 memory cards can be uploaded to the ps3 using an adaptor so that you can continue to play an older game from the same stage as you left it on your ps2 .
q : with the delayed european launch of the ps3 , will this cause a reduction in the price for european consumers to match the wait ?
david , london a : phil harrison said there would be no change to the us or the european prices for the ps3 .
the recent price drop in japan was to make sure that the price was " in line " with the price people would pay in the rest of the world , he said .
when prices were set , he said , sony went for " magic figures " : under $ 500 and under 500 euros , for the 20gb console .
the japanese price was derived from these figures .
however , he said , that had made a price that was too expensive for japanese gamers and they had been forced to drop the price .
q : will the wii and ps3 be region-free ?
or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .
q : is there any chance of the rumble function being reincluded in the controller ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : sony has said the rumble function , which makes ps2 controllers vibrate in response to the onscreen action , will not be included in future ps3 controllers .
phil harrison said that the decision to not include the feature was two-fold .
first , he said , it was too expensive to keep the dual shock controller , as they were known , and include the motion sensors and tilt function in the new controller .
the new functionality allows gamers to control what is happening on screen by moving the controller in the air .
he also said that more importantly the new controller gave games designers more freedom to create new and interesting games .
" giving the user more control over the game is a much better feature than a reaction from the console that they can not control , " he said .
sony were hoping to impress people with the playstation 3 q : how will the ps3 be upgradeable -lrb- if at all -rrb- ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : the ps3 will be upgradeable in two ways .
first the firmware , which is similar to a computers operating system , will be able to be updated over the internet .
software too can be downloaded from the net , allowing users to keep up to date with new features and add-ons for games .
the hardware , whilst not directly upgradeable , supports a large number of industry-standard interfaces such as usb , bluetooth and flash memory cards .
therefore a large number of peripherals , that sony expect will be made by third party companies , can be easily plugged into the ps3 .
so for example the hard disc could be easily upgraded by buying an external usb drive .
q : with the imminent release of the wii , and the ps3 next march , competition finally seems to be hotting up .
is there a buzz at tgs this year and any indication of who may come out on top in japan ?
steven bagley , walsall , west midlands a : unfortunately nintendo did not attend the tokyo games show , preferring to hold its own events instead .
however , there was still a lot of talk about the wii and there is a general enthusiasm here about its release .
nintendo have a strong following in japan and their unorthodox controller has got many games developers and gamers excited .
the xbox 360 , which has been on the market for nearly a year , is making inroads into the japanese market .
microsoft has started to develop and release titles specifically for japanese gamers , something they did not do with the original xbox .
on the microsoft stand there were two-hour queues to play blue dragon and lost odyssey , the latest role playing games .
these games and the new price of the xbox 360 mean that people are now taking microsoft more seriously in japan .
however , tgs has been sony 's show in many ways .
they had the largest presence here and had throngs of people eager to try out the ps3 and a list of new titles .
the price reduction in japan means that the console is now more affordable , but it is still more expensive than both the wii and xbox 360 .

or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .
q : is there any chance of the rumble function being reincluded in the controller ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : sony has said the rumble function , which makes ps2 controllers vibrate in response to the onscreen action , will not be included in future ps3 controllers .
phil harrison said that the decision to not include the feature was two-fold .
first , he said , it was too expensive to keep the dual shock controller , as they were known , and include the motion sensors and tilt function in the new controller .
the new functionality allows gamers to control what is happening on screen by moving the controller in the air .
he also said that more importantly the new controller gave games designers more freedom to create new and interesting games .
" giving the user more control over the game is a much better feature than a reaction from the console that they can not control , " he said .
sony were hoping to impress people with the playstation 3 q : how will the ps3 be upgradeable -lrb- if at all -rrb- ?
john , bangor , northern ireland a : the ps3 will be upgradeable in two ways .
first the firmware , which is similar to a computers operating system , will be able to be updated over the internet .
software too can be downloaded from the net , allowing users to keep up to date with new features and add-ons for games .
the hardware , whilst not directly upgradeable , supports a large number of industry-standard interfaces such as usb , bluetooth and flash memory cards .
therefore a large number of peripherals , that sony expect will be made by third party companies , can be easily plugged into the ps3 .
so for example the hard disc could be easily upgraded by buying an external usb drive .
q : with the imminent release of the wii , and the ps3 next march , competition finally seems to be hotting up .
is there a buzz at tgs this year and any indication of who may come out on top in japan ?
steven bagley , walsall , west midlands a : unfortunately nintendo did not attend the tokyo games show , preferring to hold its own events instead .
however , there was still a lot of talk about the wii and there is a general enthusiasm here about its release .
nintendo have a strong following in japan and their unorthodox controller has got many games developers and gamers excited .
the xbox 360 , which has been on the market for nearly a year , is making inroads into the japanese market .
microsoft has started to develop and release titles specifically for japanese gamers , something they did not do with the original xbox .
on the microsoft stand there were two-hour queues to play blue dragon and lost odyssey , the latest role playing games .
these games and the new price of the xbox 360 mean that people are now taking microsoft more seriously in japan .
however , tgs has been sony 's show in many ways .
they had the largest presence here and had throngs of people eager to try out the ps3 and a list of new titles .
the price reduction in japan means that the console is now more affordable , but it is still more expensive than both the wii and xbox 360 .
the delays have also meant that some gamers have already bought an xbox 360 instead .
at the moment it is impossible to forecast who will win the console battle with two consoles still due for release but it will be a story that the technology team will be following closely over the next year .
q : how will the online component of the ps3 work ?
david blair , stockport england a : the ps3 is pretty much plug and play .
if you have a broadband connection you can plug the ps3 into your modem or router and you are online .
if you have wireless , the ps3 will connect .
using the playstation network platform , as it is known , you can play games with people from around the world , have conversations using the inbuilt video and instant messaging systems or download games and software for your ps3 .
the internet connection also allows you to browse the web on the television that your ps3 is plugged in to .
q : what can the 360 offer someone , like myself , who does n't really like fps , driving , sports or general online gaming which seem to make up most of the 360 titles out there ?
mark , newport , wales a : xbox are releasing a huge number of new games .
peter moore , the head of xbox , said that there would be 110 xbox 360 titles by the end of the year .
within this line up are different styles of game including role-playing games and quirky social games like viva piñata .
in the game , players take control of a garden that grows in real time .
with proper maintenance the garden attracts new creatures , or piñatas .
the game has a strong social element with players able to trade objects and animals from their garden , many of which can be customised , over the internet .
microsoft will be making a series of announcements about their new games at their event x06 in barcelona next week .
" watch this space , " said mr moore .
q : how long are xbox games going to be manufactured , and when will more xbox 360 games be released .
it seems at the moment that the ground is very thin .
matt owen , kent , uk a : although many of the teams that comprise microsoft game studios started making games for the xbox 360 when it was released , some continue to publish xbox titles .
peter moore said that he expects this to continue throughout 2007 .
after that , third party companies will probably make any xbox titles , he said .
" i think as long as people keep playing them , publishers will keep making them , " mr moore said .
q : when will xbox 360 games be keyboard and mouse compatible -lrb- or will they ever -rrb- ?
a : no .
peter moore said that there would never be a mouse and keyboard attachment for the xbox 360 .
" its not meant to be a productivity device , it 's -lsb- the xbox 360 -rsb- about fun , " he said .
q : i 'd like to know if the quality of graphics and the gameplay of the ps3 are a lot better than the xbox 360 or if it pretty much feels the same when playing .
jeremy , ottawa , canada a : at the moment many ps3 games are still in development and therefore it is difficult to compare the two .
the ps3 games i have played - including resistance : fall of man , gran turismo hd and lair - do not play any better than many xbox 360 titles on show .
both are slick and have amazing visuals and gameplay .
at the moment , the ps3 games are not able to take full advantage of the cell processor so future games may look and play differently .
i would expect that the games for both the xbox 360 and ps3 will continue to improve and surprise gamers as the consoles mature , in the same way that games improved for the original xbox and ps2 throughout their lives .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- tokyo games show : your questions bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 24 september 2006 , 07:23 gmt 08:23 uk tokyo games show : your questions bbc news reporter jonathan fildes is in japan covering the tokyo game show , one of the biggest videogame conferences in the world .
we put to him the best questions you sent in to us about the playstation 3 , xbox 360 and nintendo wii , which will be battling it out for dominance in your living room this christmas .
q : a question i would like to ask sony is . " why did they only push back the release date for europe , but still go ahead with the original release date for the usa and asia ?
why not put the release date back for the whole world ? "
rob garcia , malaga , spain a : phil harrison , head of worldwide studios at sony computer entertainment europe says that sony decided to delay in europe as it is the most complex market for them to distribute consoles .
the european region is made of 104 countries that have different safety standards and different languages .
the large number of countries makes it logistically difficult to distribute the consoles , he said .
in contrast , mr harrison said , north america consists of three countries with 2 main languages .
in addition 80 % of all sales come from 20 chains of shops making it easier to distribute the consoles .
geographically it is also closer to china where the consoles are assembled .
japan , the other region that will see ps3s on shelves in november , is also a more homogenous market , he said .
like america it is geographically closer to the factory .
" sony felt it was better to delay in one market rather than risk failure in three markets and ending up disappointing everybody , " mr harrison told the bbc news website .
mr harrison said that he also personally regrets the decision , as he will no longer be able to have a ps3 in time for christmas as sony is sending all production models out to their customers .
q : will the new ps3 be backwards compatible with ps2 games ?
michelle , doncaster , england a : yes .
the ps3 has software that allows it to play 99 % of playstation 1 and 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- discs .
in addition , ken kutaragi , the head of playstation at sony , has said that ps3 owners will be able to download older playstation titles from the internet using sony 's new online service .
" game saves " on ps2 memory cards can be uploaded to the ps3 using an adaptor so that you can continue to play an older game from the same stage as you left it on your ps2 .
q : with the delayed european launch of the ps3 , will this cause a reduction in the price for european consumers to match the wait ?
david , london a : phil harrison said there would be no change to the us or the european prices for the ps3 .
the recent price drop in japan was to make sure that the price was " in line " with the price people would pay in the rest of the world , he said .
when prices were set , he said , sony went for " magic figures " : under $ 500 and under 500 euros , for the 20gb console .
the japanese price was derived from these figures .
however , he said , that had made a price that was too expensive for japanese gamers and they had been forced to drop the price .
q : will the wii and ps3 be region-free ?
or will the games publisher be able to lock the game down to a specific region ?
alan , fareham a : the ps3 will have region free games , allowing european gamers for example to play titles from japan or the us .
nintendo has said that the wii will have a region lock for in-house and third-party titles .
sony have also said that although their games will be region free , blu-ray films will fall into three regions , with japan and america falling into the same regional code .
existing dvd region codes will remain the same .

the environment group wwf says many eu fishing fleets are breaking the law and catching far more tuna than allowed .
traditionally much of the catch is exported to japan , but there is an ever-growing sushi market in europe .
the uk government wants seasonal closure of fishing grounds and stricter rules governing tuna farms .
demand is currently so strong that single fish can sell for thousands of pounds .
with sushi continuing to be a fashionable cuisine , the uk is consuming 600 tonnes a year .
the eu has already recognised illegal industrial overfishing is going on in the mediterranean but says there is not yet sufficient regulation or monitoring to stop it , particularly on fish farms .
traditional fishermen who have caught bluefin tuna sustainably since roman times now say their catches are down by 80 % .
officials from the uk 's department for environment , food and rural affairs are now pressing for urgent action .
