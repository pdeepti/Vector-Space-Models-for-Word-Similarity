dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .

" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .

he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .

" investing more in r & d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matti vanhanen is for more r & d in europe experts agree that europe 's global importance as a production location will decline over the long-term , wahl said . " that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .

" that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .
they are not allowed to apply for driving licenses , to leave their state of north rhine-westphalia , and they have a tough time getting job training opportunities , let alone real jobs . fayssal says he would like to work - he did a traineeship with a supermarket chain and would like to get a certificate in retail sales . " i would have sent my application but i knew that i did n't stand a chance , " he said .
" my boss even told me as much . " lack of prospects fayssal finished school a year ago , and these days , has a lot of free time on his hands .
he spends most of it at a local youth center , run by stefan hoeps . hoeps knows lots of kids and young adults who share fayssal 's problem - a total lack of prospects . " they 're enormously frustrated , " hoeps said .
" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .
" and that 's exactly the point - it 's a vicious circle .
no papers , no chance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal with his nephews : " why should n't i be allowed to stay ? "
but bernd brack of the human rights ngo pro asyl in essen takes issue with the legal situation in germany .
he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit . " i 've assimilated , i 'm integrated , i 've never committed a crime here , and i 'm a normal person just like anyone else , " he said .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .

literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .
they are not allowed to apply for driving licenses , to leave their state of north rhine-westphalia , and they have a tough time getting job training opportunities , let alone real jobs . fayssal says he would like to work - he did a traineeship with a supermarket chain and would like to get a certificate in retail sales . " i would have sent my application but i knew that i did n't stand a chance , " he said .
" my boss even told me as much . " lack of prospects fayssal finished school a year ago , and these days , has a lot of free time on his hands .
he spends most of it at a local youth center , run by stefan hoeps . hoeps knows lots of kids and young adults who share fayssal 's problem - a total lack of prospects . " they 're enormously frustrated , " hoeps said .
" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .
" and that 's exactly the point - it 's a vicious circle .
no papers , no chance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal with his nephews : " why should n't i be allowed to stay ? "
but bernd brack of the human rights ngo pro asyl in essen takes issue with the legal situation in germany .
he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit . " i 've assimilated , i 'm integrated , i 've never committed a crime here , and i 'm a normal person just like anyone else , " he said .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .

dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .
they are not allowed to apply for driving licenses , to leave their state of north rhine-westphalia , and they have a tough time getting job training opportunities , let alone real jobs . fayssal says he would like to work - he did a traineeship with a supermarket chain and would like to get a certificate in retail sales . " i would have sent my application but i knew that i did n't stand a chance , " he said .
" my boss even told me as much . " lack of prospects fayssal finished school a year ago , and these days , has a lot of free time on his hands .
he spends most of it at a local youth center , run by stefan hoeps . hoeps knows lots of kids and young adults who share fayssal 's problem - a total lack of prospects . " they 're enormously frustrated , " hoeps said .
" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .
" and that 's exactly the point - it 's a vicious circle .
no papers , no chance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal with his nephews : " why should n't i be allowed to stay ? "
but bernd brack of the human rights ngo pro asyl in essen takes issue with the legal situation in germany .
he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit . " i 've assimilated , i 'm integrated , i 've never committed a crime here , and i 'm a normal person just like anyone else , " he said .

dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win ! " pasted on their chests , naturally in the unmistakable font of bwin . beware of what you 're wearing - and where bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego just a few weeks earlier in bwin kit werder bremen 's alternative kit is only one example of the extent of the measures bwin is taking in the current legal fight with german states .
the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .
new iron-on " we win ! " patches are being provided so even hobby players wo n't be prosecuted . " by doing that we are taking the clubs out of the authorities ' line of fire , " said jörg wacker , bwin 's marketing director . but exactly who is in the crosshairs of prosecutors varies .
the city-state of bremen is siding with its famous club and thomas schaaf 's players ' home uniforms will have the bwin logo on it .
the state of bavaria has shown no leniency in the matter . " that -lrb- betting -rrb- is criminal behaviour because it is illegal in germany to bet privately , " said the southern state 's interior minister günther beckstein .
second-division 1860 munich has been forced to wear the " we win ! " variant at home . millions at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oddset is the name of the state-run bookmaker not only is bwin 's presence at sporting events on the line in this struggle between a state monopoly and the proponents of liberalized gambling laws .
the internet gaming company spends close to 56 million euros -lrb- $ 71.7 million -rrb- on advertising , a large part on soccer , but other sports like basketball and handball , whose associations use the money for youth programs , could be negatively affected . television networks also might find large holes in their budgets .
the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .
when all is said and done , however , the european court of justice may have the final word .
it has already ruled in favor of an italian online bookmaker in a similar case , which could give reason for cautious optimism at bwin in germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state bans online bookmaker austrian-based online bookmaker bwin faces complete closure of its german business after the eastern german state of saxony revoked its licence .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .

dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .
they are not allowed to apply for driving licenses , to leave their state of north rhine-westphalia , and they have a tough time getting job training opportunities , let alone real jobs . fayssal says he would like to work - he did a traineeship with a supermarket chain and would like to get a certificate in retail sales . " i would have sent my application but i knew that i did n't stand a chance , " he said .
" my boss even told me as much . " lack of prospects fayssal finished school a year ago , and these days , has a lot of free time on his hands .
he spends most of it at a local youth center , run by stefan hoeps . hoeps knows lots of kids and young adults who share fayssal 's problem - a total lack of prospects . " they 're enormously frustrated , " hoeps said .
" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .
" and that 's exactly the point - it 's a vicious circle .
no papers , no chance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal with his nephews : " why should n't i be allowed to stay ? "
but bernd brack of the human rights ngo pro asyl in essen takes issue with the legal situation in germany .
he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit . " i 've assimilated , i 'm integrated , i 've never committed a crime here , and i 'm a normal person just like anyone else , " he said .
" why should n't i be allowed to stay ?

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions .

" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn .

this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .

" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at .

fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .
the bureaucrats in brussels do n't know better than the local businesspeople and employee . " investing more in r & d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matti vanhanen is for more r & d in europe experts agree that europe 's global importance as a production location will decline over the long-term , wahl said . " that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .
european commission president jose manuel barroso 's plan to establish a european elite institute for research and development may be a first step in that direction . katrin hoffmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu responds to drought with breaks for farmers not only are europe 's high temperatures sending people scrambling for a scrap of shade , they 're harming crops .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2006 neanderthal still posing questions 150 years after discovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neanderthal : a different kind of man in 1856 , two workers found 16 bones in a limestone quarry in the neander valley , east of düsseldorf .
it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2006 eu tries balancing internal inequality and external competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more r & d in europe is the key to long-term competitiveness economic and social differences within europe have only become more pronounced as the european union expands .
the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .
the bureaucrats in brussels do n't know better than the local businesspeople and employee . " investing more in r & d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matti vanhanen is for more r & d in europe experts agree that europe 's global importance as a production location will decline over the long-term , wahl said . " that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .
european commission president jose manuel barroso 's plan to establish a european elite institute for research and development may be a first step in that direction . katrin hoffmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu responds to drought with breaks for farmers not only are europe 's high temperatures sending people scrambling for a scrap of shade , they 're harming crops .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .

" that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .
the bureaucrats in brussels do n't know better than the local businesspeople and employee . " investing more in r & d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matti vanhanen is for more r & d in europe experts agree that europe 's global importance as a production location will decline over the long-term , wahl said . " that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .
european commission president jose manuel barroso 's plan to establish a european elite institute for research and development may be a first step in that direction . katrin hoffmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu responds to drought with breaks for farmers not only are europe 's high temperatures sending people scrambling for a scrap of shade , they 're harming crops .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2006 germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacation is sacrosanct for germans germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2006 eu tries balancing internal inequality and external competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more r & d in europe is the key to long-term competitiveness economic and social differences within europe have only become more pronounced as the european union expands .
the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .
again it was bremen 's new midfield playmaker diego who assisted .
with a goal and assist last week , the brazilian has already made most werder supporters forget the departure of former moody midfield maestro johan micoud . hertha berlin humiliate hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike here , the ball was mostly in hanover 's net against berlin after just two games , hanover coach peter neururer must be wishing he still had per mertesacker to anchor the back line .
there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .
again it was bremen 's new midfield playmaker diego who assisted .
with a goal and assist last week , the brazilian has already made most werder supporters forget the departure of former moody midfield maestro johan micoud . hertha berlin humiliate hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike here , the ball was mostly in hanover 's net against berlin after just two games , hanover coach peter neururer must be wishing he still had per mertesacker to anchor the back line .
there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win !

the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .

the city-state of bremen is siding with its famous club and thomas schaaf 's players ' home uniforms will have the bwin logo on it .
the state of bavaria has shown no leniency in the matter . " that -lrb- betting -rrb- is criminal behaviour because it is illegal in germany to bet privately , " said the southern state 's interior minister günther beckstein .

the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

" it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .

" neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question .

" neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win ! " pasted on their chests , naturally in the unmistakable font of bwin . beware of what you 're wearing - and where bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego just a few weeks earlier in bwin kit werder bremen 's alternative kit is only one example of the extent of the measures bwin is taking in the current legal fight with german states .
the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .
new iron-on " we win ! " patches are being provided so even hobby players wo n't be prosecuted . " by doing that we are taking the clubs out of the authorities ' line of fire , " said jörg wacker , bwin 's marketing director . but exactly who is in the crosshairs of prosecutors varies .
the city-state of bremen is siding with its famous club and thomas schaaf 's players ' home uniforms will have the bwin logo on it .
the state of bavaria has shown no leniency in the matter . " that -lrb- betting -rrb- is criminal behaviour because it is illegal in germany to bet privately , " said the southern state 's interior minister günther beckstein .
second-division 1860 munich has been forced to wear the " we win ! " variant at home . millions at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oddset is the name of the state-run bookmaker not only is bwin 's presence at sporting events on the line in this struggle between a state monopoly and the proponents of liberalized gambling laws .
the internet gaming company spends close to 56 million euros -lrb- $ 71.7 million -rrb- on advertising , a large part on soccer , but other sports like basketball and handball , whose associations use the money for youth programs , could be negatively affected . television networks also might find large holes in their budgets .
the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .
when all is said and done , however , the european court of justice may have the final word .
it has already ruled in favor of an italian online bookmaker in a similar case , which could give reason for cautious optimism at bwin in germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state bans online bookmaker austrian-based online bookmaker bwin faces complete closure of its german business after the eastern german state of saxony revoked its licence .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .

" we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .

" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at .

the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn .

this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security . " we need to introduce targeted modern video technology and spot controls in specific danger zones , " he said .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .
again it was bremen 's new midfield playmaker diego who assisted .
with a goal and assist last week , the brazilian has already made most werder supporters forget the departure of former moody midfield maestro johan micoud . hertha berlin humiliate hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike here , the ball was mostly in hanover 's net against berlin after just two games , hanover coach peter neururer must be wishing he still had per mertesacker to anchor the back line .
there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .
dutch national player nigel de jong preserved the one point for pre-season title aspirants hamburg in the 71st minute .
after both sides started cautiously , hamburg took the lead in the 39th minute on boubacar 's rifled a shot into the upper right-hand corner from 20 meters out .
cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .
schalke 's dario rodriguez got the lone goal in the 53rd minute and the royal blues have four points after two games . frankfurt , wolfsburg in ho-hum affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of pushing did n't help either wolfsburg or frankfurt the man in the match between frankfurt and wolfsburg was home goalkeeper markus pröll .
he saved a point for frankfurt after stopping a diego klimowicz penalty just nine minutes from time .
strikers ioannis amanatidis and michael thurk should never have allowed it to come to pröll 's heroics , having given up numerous golden chances to score . on friday , nuremberg completed a dream start to the season .
coach hans meyer 's team beat mönchengladbach 1-0 at home and based on goal difference lie at the top of the standings for the moment .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

18 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security . " we need to introduce targeted modern video technology and spot controls in specific danger zones , " he said .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

18 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .
that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win !

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security . " we need to introduce targeted modern video technology and spot controls in specific danger zones , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2006 germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacation is sacrosanct for germans germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

18 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .
that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say .

do you agree that germans should spend less on annual vacation and save for their twilight years instead ?

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win ! " pasted on their chests , naturally in the unmistakable font of bwin . beware of what you 're wearing - and where bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego just a few weeks earlier in bwin kit werder bremen 's alternative kit is only one example of the extent of the measures bwin is taking in the current legal fight with german states .
the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .
new iron-on " we win ! " patches are being provided so even hobby players wo n't be prosecuted . " by doing that we are taking the clubs out of the authorities ' line of fire , " said jörg wacker , bwin 's marketing director . but exactly who is in the crosshairs of prosecutors varies .
the city-state of bremen is siding with its famous club and thomas schaaf 's players ' home uniforms will have the bwin logo on it .
the state of bavaria has shown no leniency in the matter . " that -lrb- betting -rrb- is criminal behaviour because it is illegal in germany to bet privately , " said the southern state 's interior minister günther beckstein .
second-division 1860 munich has been forced to wear the " we win ! " variant at home . millions at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oddset is the name of the state-run bookmaker not only is bwin 's presence at sporting events on the line in this struggle between a state monopoly and the proponents of liberalized gambling laws .
the internet gaming company spends close to 56 million euros -lrb- $ 71.7 million -rrb- on advertising , a large part on soccer , but other sports like basketball and handball , whose associations use the money for youth programs , could be negatively affected . television networks also might find large holes in their budgets .
the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .
when all is said and done , however , the european court of justice may have the final word .
it has already ruled in favor of an italian online bookmaker in a similar case , which could give reason for cautious optimism at bwin in germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state bans online bookmaker austrian-based online bookmaker bwin faces complete closure of its german business after the eastern german state of saxony revoked its licence .

he stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of attempted murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspected bomber is led away by german security officials mohammed is suspected of planting one of two crude bombs in two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 31 on separate trains in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . police say they were set to go off 10 minutes before the trains arrived in the two cities .
the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .
local media reports said police were searching the suspect 's residence , a student dormitory in the town .
quoting fellow students who lived near him , news magazine spiegel said the lebanese student was described as " friendly , polite , devout but relatively inconspicuous . " link to lebanon ? investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security official holds up one of the gas canisters " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . he said a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . new generation of terrorists the bomb plot has created jitters in germany which has thus far been spared any major terrorist attacks since sept .
11 , 2001 . however , interior minister wolfgang schäuble has warned he could not rule out an attack on the german public transport system to rival the bombings in madrid and london which killed dozens of passengers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have been warning that the middle east conflict could inflame its muslim community schäuble has also warned in recent weeks that the conflict in the middle east could inflame the muslim community in germany and lead to a radicalization among arab youth .
the minister said some 900 hezbollah supporters as well 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas were believed to be in germany . politicians are also warning that the incident highlights the risk that a new generation of militants unknown to security services were ready to strike . " that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .
" we do n't know anymore who is living among us .
therefore we need to use every tool at our disposal . " calls for tougher anti-terror measures schäuble said the government would have to seriously consider expanding video surveillance at airports and railway stations and implementing a long-discussed central anti-terrorism database that would allow various security agencies to access and exchange information and coordinate more closely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some want to expand video surveillance at public places wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives in parliament , said he hoped the failed attack would be a " wake-up call " for those leery of tighter security . " we need to introduce targeted modern video technology and spot controls in specific danger zones , " he said .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .

there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .

after both sides started cautiously , hamburg took the lead in the 39th minute on boubacar 's rifled a shot into the upper right-hand corner from 20 meters out .
cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .
schalke 's dario rodriguez got the lone goal in the 53rd minute and the royal blues have four points after two games . frankfurt , wolfsburg in ho-hum affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of pushing did n't help either wolfsburg or frankfurt the man in the match between frankfurt and wolfsburg was home goalkeeper markus pröll .
he saved a point for frankfurt after stopping a diego klimowicz penalty just nine minutes from time .
strikers ioannis amanatidis and michael thurk should never have allowed it to come to pröll 's heroics , having given up numerous golden chances to score . on friday , nuremberg completed a dream start to the season .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen .

" neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .

dw-world.de examines a life without prospects . it 's 8:00 a.m. at the office for foreigners ' affairs in essen , western germany .
fayssal saado , 19 and his brother sami , 17 are tired .
they 're here to extend their duldung or " exceptional leave to remain " permits .
literally translated , the german word means sufferance , or toleration . the civil servant types in a routine manner , prints out new passport stickers , and makes them official with a stamp .
fayssal goes through the same procedure every three months .
but today , he 's been asked to step into the office of karl rothvoss , the deputy head of the office .
rothvoss says the saados have not tried hard enough to prove their identity . " the mother has to clearly lay out the family structure for us , and also say what she 's done , what possibilities there still are , or where things have perhaps gone wrong , " rothvoss said . lots of things are still unclear about the saado family .
in their file , it says that they came to germany with fake passports , something the family denies .
fayssal 's father had a so-called " stateless " passport that was issued in lebanon , meaning that , at some point , he immigrated to lebanon .
fayssal does n't know when or from where .
his father died 15 years ago .
his mother claims to have been born and raised in lebanon ; rothvoss wants to see some proof of that claim . lebanese families in limbo the saado family is one of around 1,500 lebanese families living as refugees with unclear status in essen alone .
nationwide , around 5,500 people of lebanese descent are in a similar situation .
most of them came to germany in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in lebanon . the german authorities were generous then and granted many residency permits .
but years later , turkish and syrian passports were discovered for some of the refugees who said they were from lebanon .
they were deported , but their deception cast a general shadow of suspicion over the rest of the refugees .
their residence permits were frequently changed into " exceptional leave to remain " status - a fate that befell the saado family two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal is eager to work and study in germany , but his status gets in the way for fayssal and his six siblings , that means lots of responsibilities , but hardly any rights .
they are not allowed to apply for driving licenses , to leave their state of north rhine-westphalia , and they have a tough time getting job training opportunities , let alone real jobs . fayssal says he would like to work - he did a traineeship with a supermarket chain and would like to get a certificate in retail sales . " i would have sent my application but i knew that i did n't stand a chance , " he said .
" my boss even told me as much . " lack of prospects fayssal finished school a year ago , and these days , has a lot of free time on his hands .
he spends most of it at a local youth center , run by stefan hoeps . hoeps knows lots of kids and young adults who share fayssal 's problem - a total lack of prospects . " they 're enormously frustrated , " hoeps said .
" they ask why they should bother to do well in school , as it wo n't do them any good .
they lack basic motivation . " hoeps recognizes that fayssal 's problems stem from the fact that his mother does n't have any documents to prove her lebanese origin , but adds that the authorities are not to blame .
due to the legal situation , they have no choice . " at some point , even the most compassionate staff member finds his hands are tied , " hoeps said .
" and that 's exactly the point - it 's a vicious circle .
no papers , no chance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayssal with his nephews : " why should n't i be allowed to stay ? "
but bernd brack of the human rights ngo pro asyl in essen takes issue with the legal situation in germany .
he says it 's " tragic " that the authorities insist on going so far back in a family 's history just to determine their origin .
hardly any germans could say for certain where their ancestors lived four generations ago , he argues . brack suggests a language test to indicate whether a refugee really comes from the country he or she claims .
and in his view , at least the children born to refugees in germany should be entitled to a residence permit .
he is hoping these suggestions will be addressed at an upcoming interior ministers ' conference in november . fayssal could tell the ministers exactly why he should be entitled to a permit . " i 've assimilated , i 'm integrated , i 've never committed a crime here , and i 'm a normal person just like anyone else , " he said .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .

von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2006 eu tries balancing internal inequality and external competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more r & d in europe is the key to long-term competitiveness economic and social differences within europe have only become more pronounced as the european union expands .
the eu wants to remedy the inequalities and maintain a competitive advantage on the global market - but how ? european unification began at the economic level with the founding of the european coal and steel community .
fifty-five years later , the economy is still an important aspect of the european integration process today .
but the bloc is also trying to ensure social equality between its regions . " in comparing the european economic model with other economic regions like the us or asia , it becomes apparent that europe , apart from the economic dynamic , puts relatively high priority on social equality , " said stefanie wahl , the director of the institute for economy and society in bonn .
" it tries to realize both goals . " a plan for equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of inequitable agricultural subsidies surrounded the 2004 eu expansion at the end of last year , the european commission approved a financial plan for 2007 to 2013 that is designed to strengthen europe 's position on the world market while increasing the prosperity of its member states .
in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn . " either you try to harmonize and manage everything , or you let competition run its course and see which countries introduce which regulations and taxes and so forth , " he said . regulation or competition ? the european union has chosen the first approach : regulation .
this is particularly apparent in europe 's subsidy policy , where the eu sustains economic sectors that would collapse without external support . agriculture currently takes top priority in europe 's subsidy policy .
nearly 50 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies - even though many experts and politicians view this as backwards , expensive and extremely dangerous to development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " human capital is europe 's best resource " " we are artificially holding up the agriculture sector ; we 're driving the prices down and that makes for competition with the developing countries , which can not be justified , " said manfred neumann from the institute for international economic policy at the university of bonn . subsidy policy has been a particularly thorny for britain . " i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .
" they have to become much quicker because the international competition has increased and is placing high demands on europe . " but standardization has to have its limits , said manfred neumann . " why should the germans live just like the sicilians ? " he asked .
" we should n't try to govern every little thing .
the bureaucrats in brussels do n't know better than the local businesspeople and employee . " investing more in r & d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matti vanhanen is for more r & d in europe experts agree that europe 's global importance as a production location will decline over the long-term , wahl said . " that 's why we have to make an effort to maintain our competitive margin with knowledge and skills , " she added .
" we wo n't be completely successful in this but we need to invest more in research and development because that 's what we can be good at . " the european continent is poor in natural resources , so human capital is the most important resource to invest in , wahl said . finnish premier matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has advocated more investment in research and development so that europe can continue to compete with the asian and north american economic areas .
european commission president jose manuel barroso 's plan to establish a european elite institute for research and development may be a first step in that direction . katrin hoffmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu responds to drought with breaks for farmers not only are europe 's high temperatures sending people scrambling for a scrap of shade , they 're harming crops .

" we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

in addition , it calls for the establishment of social equality within the eu . in an effort to approach social equality , the poorer member countries receive subsidies from the eu 's structural funds to finance the building of infrastructure , research and health policies .
according to the financial plan , a total of 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 458.5 billion -rrb- will flow into the poorer regions of the eu between 2007 and 2013 . there are two possible approaches to strengthening the european economy , said erik theissen from the university of bonn .

" i want my money back , " said prime minister margaret thatcher when she arranged for a special british allowance in 1984 . since then , britain contributes considerably less to the agricultural funds than the other eu member states , based on the argument that its own agricultural sector is much less significant than france 's , for example , so it does n't profit as much from the subsidies . due to complaints from other eu countries , the british allowance is to be cut appreciably by 2013 . regulation vs. flexibility in addition to subsidies , the european union also involves itself in the economic process by setting unified european standards that apply to both production procedures and the products themselves . " regulations are necessary , as long as they do not come at the expense of flexibility and reaction , " wahl said .

it was thought the bones belonged to a cave bear , but they were subsequently found to be the remains of early man . when that historic discovery was made in 1856 , three years before charles darwin published his theory of evolution ; it began a debate about the origins of mankind , which still continues today . this year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the " neanderthal man . "
an international exhibition and congress in july in bonn brought together 220 scientists from 20 countries , to discuss topics ranging from the origin of neanderthal man , to the species ' relationship to modern humans . wighart von königswald , chair of paleontology at the university of bonn , and co-organizer of the symposium , said the importance of the discovery of neanderthal man can not be underestimated . another type of man " it was the first fossil man and the first clear evidence that there is some other one like modern man , " said von königswald .
" it was a time when one discovered that all aborigines of the various continents in those days were absolutely human beings and they did interbreed with europeans .
with neanderthal man , it became clear that there were other types of man in the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is still puzzling scientists initially , however , this theory was unpopular .
von königswald said amateur naturalist johann carl fuhlrott , who was the first to pronounce the neanderthal 's bones as human , was disbelieved by many , as this notion contradicted literal interpretations of the bible . " it took quite some time until this was accepted , and even in the publication of 1859 when fuhlrott described this material , the editor of the journal said , ' it 's a nice discovery , but we do not agree at all with this interpretation . '
the author was right , not the editor , " von königswald said . nowadays , fuhlrott is regarded as one of the founders of paleoanthropology .
in the 150 years since his discovery , scientific advances have helped to uncover many facts about neanderthals . for example , according to ralf schmitz , an archaeologist and co-organizer of the " roots " exhibition at the rheinisches landesmuseum in bonn , scientists now know what the neanderthal man discovered in germany was like , and how he would have lived . getting to know the relatives " we know his age - he died at the age of 42 .
his geo-chronological age is 42,000 years , his food was mostly meat , and in the rediscovery campaign of the neanderthal type locality , we found stone implements and animal bones , " schmitz said .
" for the first time , we have an idea of the culture of that special type specimen . " it is now accepted that neanderthals inhabited europe and parts of western asia and scientists now know part of neanderthal man 's dna code , which schmitz helped to crack in 1997 , with fellow archaeologist jürgen thissen . but , schmitz is quick to add , there 's still a lot scientists do n't know .
for example , why the species became extinct . extinction questions still relevant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what caused the extinction of neanderthals , like this modeled woman , is unknown " perhaps they have had fewer children than the anatomically modern humans , perhaps the modern humans brought diseases , or perhaps they pressured them into bad grounds for hunting , " schmitz said . schmitz added that the question of why neanderthals became extinct is an important one . " neanderthals are very fascinating people , because they disappeared only 30,000 years ago , " he said .
" it was the last archaic type of man who lived on earth parallel to us for a long time , and the question is when neanderthals could go extinct , could we also go extinct ?
that 's a very important question . " the conference in bonn could n't answer this specific question , but was organized to help find the answers to questions such as these and provide a forum for scientists to discuss neanderthal technology , anatomy and environment . similarities between modern and neanderthal man erik trinkaus , professor of anthropology at washington university in the united states , has worked on two of the fossils displayed in the " roots " exhibition , and said he believes although neanderthals are not our direct ancestors , the two species have many similarities . " we used to think that there was a major behavioral shift , improvement in overall efficiency of and social organization between the two groups , but the more we look at them , the more we find that in many ways , neanderthals and early modern humans are very similar to each other behaviorally , functionally , " he said . " they 're not biologically identical , they look different and we can tell them apart easily , but when you look at them in terms of their behavioral patterns , the changes are fairly subtle , " trinkaus added . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win !

the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .

on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .
dutch national player nigel de jong preserved the one point for pre-season title aspirants hamburg in the 71st minute .
after both sides started cautiously , hamburg took the lead in the 39th minute on boubacar 's rifled a shot into the upper right-hand corner from 20 meters out .
cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .
schalke 's dario rodriguez got the lone goal in the 53rd minute and the royal blues have four points after two games . frankfurt , wolfsburg in ho-hum affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of pushing did n't help either wolfsburg or frankfurt the man in the match between frankfurt and wolfsburg was home goalkeeper markus pröll .
he saved a point for frankfurt after stopping a diego klimowicz penalty just nine minutes from time .
strikers ioannis amanatidis and michael thurk should never have allowed it to come to pröll 's heroics , having given up numerous golden chances to score . on friday , nuremberg completed a dream start to the season .
coach hans meyer 's team beat mönchengladbach 1-0 at home and based on goal difference lie at the top of the standings for the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2006 germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacation is sacrosanct for germans germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .
-lrb- feb .
18 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .
that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- feedback what do you think of the minister 's proposal ?
do you agree that germans should spend less on annual vacation and save for their twilight years instead ?

neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .

cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .
again it was bremen 's new midfield playmaker diego who assisted .
with a goal and assist last week , the brazilian has already made most werder supporters forget the departure of former moody midfield maestro johan micoud . hertha berlin humiliate hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike here , the ball was mostly in hanover 's net against berlin after just two games , hanover coach peter neururer must be wishing he still had per mertesacker to anchor the back line .
there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .
dutch national player nigel de jong preserved the one point for pre-season title aspirants hamburg in the 71st minute .
after both sides started cautiously , hamburg took the lead in the 39th minute on boubacar 's rifled a shot into the upper right-hand corner from 20 meters out .
cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .
schalke 's dario rodriguez got the lone goal in the 53rd minute and the royal blues have four points after two games . frankfurt , wolfsburg in ho-hum affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of pushing did n't help either wolfsburg or frankfurt the man in the match between frankfurt and wolfsburg was home goalkeeper markus pröll .
he saved a point for frankfurt after stopping a diego klimowicz penalty just nine minutes from time .
strikers ioannis amanatidis and michael thurk should never have allowed it to come to pröll 's heroics , having given up numerous golden chances to score . on friday , nuremberg completed a dream start to the season .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win ! " pasted on their chests , naturally in the unmistakable font of bwin . beware of what you 're wearing - and where bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego just a few weeks earlier in bwin kit werder bremen 's alternative kit is only one example of the extent of the measures bwin is taking in the current legal fight with german states .
the company also indirectly sponsors thousands of amateur clubs by providing them with inexpensive jerseys , naturally with the bwin logo splashed across the front . even those shirts , harmlessly being worn by weekend soccer seniors from kiel to garmisch , are best left at home .
new iron-on " we win ! " patches are being provided so even hobby players wo n't be prosecuted . " by doing that we are taking the clubs out of the authorities ' line of fire , " said jörg wacker , bwin 's marketing director . but exactly who is in the crosshairs of prosecutors varies .
the city-state of bremen is siding with its famous club and thomas schaaf 's players ' home uniforms will have the bwin logo on it .
the state of bavaria has shown no leniency in the matter . " that -lrb- betting -rrb- is criminal behaviour because it is illegal in germany to bet privately , " said the southern state 's interior minister günther beckstein .
second-division 1860 munich has been forced to wear the " we win ! " variant at home . millions at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oddset is the name of the state-run bookmaker not only is bwin 's presence at sporting events on the line in this struggle between a state monopoly and the proponents of liberalized gambling laws .
the internet gaming company spends close to 56 million euros -lrb- $ 71.7 million -rrb- on advertising , a large part on soccer , but other sports like basketball and handball , whose associations use the money for youth programs , could be negatively affected . television networks also might find large holes in their budgets .
the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .
when all is said and done , however , the european court of justice may have the final word .
it has already ruled in favor of an italian online bookmaker in a similar case , which could give reason for cautious optimism at bwin in germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state bans online bookmaker austrian-based online bookmaker bwin faces complete closure of its german business after the eastern german state of saxony revoked its licence .

the explosives failed to detonate , but if they had , police say they would have killed a " high number " of people . it has now emerged that mohammed along with an accomplice , who are believed to be part of a wider islamic network , had come close to exploding the two makeshift train bombs last month . " the situation is very serious , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in an interview with german public television .
" the danger has never been as high . " broader terrorist network behind the attacks ? german federal prosecutor monika harms said youssef mohammed 's fingerprints and dna matched that taken from one of two abandoned suitcases that were discovered on july 3 . the two men were captured on security cameras in the cologne train station , dragging suitcases which contained the explosive devices onto the trains .
harms said the logistical sophistication of the plot suggested the suspect was part of a broader terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video footage of the two suspects a massive manhunt is still on for the second suspect , suspected of planting the other device , whose identity has not yet been established , harms said .
the two men were not acting alone but within a " criminal organization with a solid structure , " she added . citing sources close to the inquiry , focus magazine said on its website that mohammed was a lebanese student who lived in kiel .

" that is the real reason for concern , " schäuble said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2006 germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacation is sacrosanct for germans germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

18 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- tourism experts say hot summer means higher turnover with sunny skies and high temperatures throughout july , many germans have opted at the last minute to go on vacation in their home country .
that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say .

large sums of money are at stake for both the bookmaker and sport associations . nobody was quite sure how first-division side werder bremen would react .
in their opening day match against hanover , the northern team was not only treading on enemy territory in a sporting sense .
bremen were also in potentially deep legal waters . just three days before , on august 10 , the eastern state of saxony revoked the license of online bookmaker bwin , prohibiting the austrian-based company from operating , and most importantly , from advertising in germany .
the saxon interior ministry also announced that each and every german state was in agreement with the decision . lower saxony , where hanover is located , said it would enforce the saxon proclamation , leaving werder bremen in a pinch because their jersey sponsor is bwin . reacting to the prohibition with a stiff upper lip , bremen walked onto the hanover pitch with " we win !

the german sports broadcaster dsf has reported that 15 percent of its revenue stem from bookmakers .
should the ban be upheld , then the marketers at germany 's only all-sports tv network will be putting in overtime hours looking for new advertisers . to overturn the decision , bwin has taken the matter to administrative courts around germany .

the win gives the bundesliga champions a maximum six points from two matches . makaay found the net two minutes before the break , but bochum equalized in the 52nd minute when brazilian fabio junior outplayed oliver kahn .
philipp lahm finally shot in the winning goal with 25 minutes to go .
the result sees bayern joining nuremberg and werder bremen . in sunday 's other game , vfb stuttgart won 3-2 against arminia bielefeld despite finishing the game with nine men .
cacau got the winner in the 82nd minute , his second goal of a frantic game . bremen prove their mettle playing at home for the first time this season , coach thomas schaaf 's werder bremen proved their mettle on saturday by defeating bayer leverkusen 2-1 .
with the victory bremen pulled even with nuremberg on six points to lead the table . like in their opening day 4-2 win against hanover , the northern germans came from behind to take all three points .
the guests from leverkusen took the lead on a penalty at the quarter hour mark after the team 's off-season acquisition stefan kiessling was fouled by bremen 's petri pasanen in the penalty box .
paul freier converted the spot kick for the lead , which would hold up for only 11 minutes . miroslav klose , two-goal scorer in germany 's friendly against sweden on wednesday , notched the equalizer and his second goal of the young campaign , rising above the defenders to head in a diego cross .
both sides were hungry for the victory after that , and it was substitute hugo almeida who scored the gamewinner in the 70th minute .
again it was bremen 's new midfield playmaker diego who assisted .
with a goal and assist last week , the brazilian has already made most werder supporters forget the departure of former moody midfield maestro johan micoud . hertha berlin humiliate hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike here , the ball was mostly in hanover 's net against berlin after just two games , hanover coach peter neururer must be wishing he still had per mertesacker to anchor the back line .
there was last week 's 4-2 defeat to bremen to start .
on the second match day , his team traveled to the country 's capital and suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of hertha berlin . berlin 's marko pantelic found the net twice .
pal dardai and patrick ebert scored in addition .
hanover keeper robert enke prevented the demolition from being worse by stopping a yildiray basturk penalty just before the end .
neururer , who is no stranger to being given the axe , is certainly the first coach on the hot seat this season . mainz lie even with berlin on four points after escaping dortmund with one point .
the yellow-and-black needed 75 minutes to take the lead when debutant martin amedick brought 70,000 home fans into ecstasy .
that lasted all of one minute , however , when mainz ' edu promptly tallied the equalizer . cottbus make life hard for hsv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunny times for cottbus after a 2-2 draw against hamburg energie cottbus , back in the first division after a three year absence , captured their first point against disappointing hamburg sv , drawing 2-2 .
dutch national player nigel de jong preserved the one point for pre-season title aspirants hamburg in the 71st minute .
after both sides started cautiously , hamburg took the lead in the 39th minute on boubacar 's rifled a shot into the upper right-hand corner from 20 meters out .
cottbus fought back in the second half , taking the lead after vlad munteanu scored on a penalty kick and sergiu radu 's goal . alemannia aachen , another promoted team , and despite being the better side most of the match , lost to schalke 1-0 at home .
out of the league 36 years , aachen failed to take advantage of being a man up for one hour after mladen krstajic was sent early to the showers .
schalke 's dario rodriguez got the lone goal in the 53rd minute and the royal blues have four points after two games . frankfurt , wolfsburg in ho-hum affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of pushing did n't help either wolfsburg or frankfurt the man in the match between frankfurt and wolfsburg was home goalkeeper markus pröll .
he saved a point for frankfurt after stopping a diego klimowicz penalty just nine minutes from time .
strikers ioannis amanatidis and michael thurk should never have allowed it to come to pröll 's heroics , having given up numerous golden chances to score . on friday , nuremberg completed a dream start to the season .
coach hans meyer 's team beat mönchengladbach 1-0 at home and based on goal difference lie at the top of the standings for the moment .
that could change if bayern munich wins on sunday at bochum .

the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy . a typical reaction was the editorial in the berliner kurier daily . " there are two things you should never do to a german - take away their car or cancel their holiday .
these are two things they get very touchy about , " it stated on friday . last week was slow in terms of domestic news , anyway , with august being the monty of the traditional summer lull .
but finance minister peer steinbrück should perhaps have known he would spark outrage with such comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück is struggling with popularity problems now " people are going to have to spend more on their old age and healthcare in future , " he said in an interview with a magazine .
" that means that we 'll no doubt have to forego a holiday trip in order to put aside money for later . " " germans without a holiday ! " the reaction was as swift as it was outraged . " do politicians want us to scrimp and save ourselves to death ? " screamed mass-circulation daily bild on its front page .
" germans are going to have to go without holiday !
taxes are rising .
everything is getting more expensive .
pensions are being frozen .
and now politicians want our holidays . " in a country where six weeks ' annual leave is the norm and whose citizens are probably the world champions in holidaying abroad , steinbrück 's comments could only cause a stink . the tourism industry in particular was damning in its criticism . tourism industry not amused " the only explanation that we can come up with for the finance minister 's comments are that he himself needs a holiday to relax and come up with some better ideas , " said michael buller , head of german travel website lastminute.com. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try telling germans they should cut back on this !
steinbrück " is forgetting that tourism companies are an important economic factor and employ a lot of people , " he pointed out . indeed , the german tourism industry booked revenues of more than 185 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- last year - more than seven percent of total gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the eurozone 's biggest economy - with more than 2.8 million people employed in the sector . and , despite constant fears of terrorist attacks since september 11 , 2001 , as well as the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and potential health epidemics such as sars and bird flu , tourism is still one of the growth industries in germany , said the btw tourism federation . " before telling people they should consume less , the government should first look at all the ways it can save itself , " said btw chief klaus läpple . as successive governments have tried to steer the eurozone 's biggest but at times most laggard economy back to growth , the electorate in germany has had many a bitter pill to swallow in recent years . critics say government should scrap vat tax hike the previous administration under former chancellor gerhard schröder prescribed many painful spending cuts and structural reforms . and since coming to power last year , the new left-right grand coalition headed by the conservative angela merkel has not shied away from prescribing further belt-tightening measures .
one of the most controversial is the proposed hike in valued-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from january 1 , 2007 . critics argue that the move will stifle the delicate flower of consumer demand , which is only recently showing signs of emerging from long years of torpor . the chief whip of the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , argued that steinbrück should bin the plans for the rise in vat .
" that will allow the economy to perform better and people would automatically have more money for their old age provisions , " he said . gregor gysi , a prominent member of the left party , said : " if steinbrück were to tax high-earning companies more fairly , then he would n't have to come up with such hare-brained ideas .
the problem in germany is not holiday , which millions of people ca n't take anyway , but politicians who begrudge them that holiday . " top trade unionist claus matecki agreed . " millions of germans are already having to forego their holiday because they have n't got enough money , " he said . the government was already digging deeper into peoples ' pockets by way of the vat hike and increased pension and healthcare contributions , matecki argued . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

" harming or disturbing a swan is illegal , and we hope a prosecution is brought before the person who carried out this terrible act " .
mr sidley said the male swan was recovering after an emergency operation and he hoped it could be released back into the wild in the near future .
the charity appealed for anyone with information about the shooting to contact north yorkshire police , who are investigating .

party immigration spokesman damian green said ministers had to learn from the " unprecedented numbers " who arrived in the uk after the last eu expansion .
he called on the government to use existing eu powers to control immigration to " reduce tensions " and boost the economy .
trade secretary alistair darling said migration would be " properly managed . "
he said no date had yet been set for bulgaria and romania 's accession but that when it was there would be no " open door " policy .
" what we need to do is balance the skills that we require - and yes , our economy does require skills in various areas - and at the same time having a system that is properly managed so we can take care of all the other things we need to consider , like the healthcare system , the education system and so on . "
" there is a very sensible , moderate , practical case to make that we can not simply have uncontrolled immigration from these new countries . "
damien green conservative immigration spokesman bbc political correspondent laura kuenssberg said immigration was once a key conservative policy but , having lost three elections , the party had moved away from emphasising it .
but debate on the issue was increasing , with former labour minister frank field and senior backbencher john denham voicing their opinions recently so it was not surprising the conservatives had joined in , she said .
it comes as a poll for the sunday times found 77 % of people wanted the government to set a strict limit on the number of immigrants allowed into britain each year .
the uk government has yet to indicate whether workers from romania and bulgaria will enjoy the full working rights associated with being an eu citizen from the outset .
while other eu countries imposed quotas on migrant workers after the last accession , the british government 's estimates that as few as 13,000 would arrive in the uk have been far exceeded . "
migrant workers should only be allowed in if it can be proved there is an existing skill shortage " bob cotton british hospitality association send us your comments mr green , speaking on bbc news 24 sunday , said 600,000 had arrived .
" what we are saying is that we should learn from the government 's mistaken planning over poland and the other countries and we should use the powers that are there in the -lsb- eu -rsb- treaty to regulate the flow , to control the flow of people coming from bulgaria and romania . "
another influx could " put unacceptable pressure on public services , on school places , on the provision of housing , which causes big problems for certain local communities " .
he said a leaked home office report had suggested 45,000 criminals could be considering entering the uk .
" that 's one concern but even without the criminal element , there is a very sensible , moderate , practical case to make that we can not simply have uncontrolled immigration from these new countries . "
he did not put a figure on how many bulgarians and romanians should be allowed in , saying it depended on what controls other european countries imposed .
" what 's really important about immigration is to strike the proper balance so we can maintain community cohesion in this country , we can reduce tensions and we can benefit our economy . "
business leaders have also urged the government to take action .
susan anderson of the confederation of british industry said : " there is a strong argument to pause for a period before opening up to workers from further new member states while we learn the lessons from experience to date . "

party immigration spokesman damian green said ministers had to learn from the " unprecedented numbers " who arrived in the uk after the last eu expansion .
he called on the government to use existing eu powers to control immigration to " reduce tensions " and boost the economy .
trade secretary alistair darling said migration would be " properly managed . "
he said no date had yet been set for bulgaria and romania 's accession but that when it was there would be no " open door " policy .
" what we need to do is balance the skills that we require - and yes , our economy does require skills in various areas - and at the same time having a system that is properly managed so we can take care of all the other things we need to consider , like the healthcare system , the education system and so on . "
there is a very sensible , moderate , practical case to make that we can not simply have uncontrolled immigration from these new countries .
damien green conservative immigration spokesman eu candidate countries see interview bbc political correspondent laura kuenssberg said immigration was once a key conservative policy but , having lost three elections , the party had moved away from emphasising it .
but debate on the issue was increasing , with former labour minister frank field and senior backbencher john denham voicing their opinions recently so it was not surprising the conservatives had joined in , she said .
it comes as a poll for the sunday times found 77 % of people wanted the government to set a strict limit on the number of immigrants allowed into britain each year .
the uk government has yet to indicate whether workers from romania and bulgaria will enjoy the full working rights associated with being an eu citizen from the outset .
while other eu countries imposed quotas on migrant workers after the last accession , the british government 's estimates that as few as 13,000 would arrive in the uk have been far exceeded .
migrant workers should only be allowed in if it can be proved there is an existing skill shortage bob cotton british hospitality association send us your comments mr green , speaking on bbc news 24 sunday , said 600,000 had arrived .
" what we are saying is that we should learn from the government 's mistaken planning over poland and the other countries and we should use the powers that are there in the -lsb- eu -rsb- treaty to regulate the flow , to control the flow of people coming from bulgaria and romania . "
another influx could " put unacceptable pressure on public services , on school places , on the provision of housing , which causes big problems for certain local communities " .
he said a leaked home office report had suggested 45,000 criminals could be considering entering the uk .
" that 's one concern but even without the criminal element , there is a very sensible , moderate , practical case to make that we can not simply have uncontrolled immigration from these new countries . "
he did not put a figure on how many bulgarians and romanians should be allowed in , saying it depended on what controls other european countries imposed .
" what 's really important about immigration is to strike the proper balance so we can maintain community cohesion in this country , we can reduce tensions and we can benefit our economy . "
business leaders have also urged the government to take action .
susan anderson of the confederation of british industry said : " there is a strong argument to pause for a period before opening up to workers from further new member states while we learn the lessons from experience to date .
we could attract more than 10,000 romanians at all levels for the construction industry as well as the hotel and catering service industries in the uk dominic ryan premier global recruitment " present systems for monitoring and controlling migration need to be improved . "
bob cotton , chief executive of the british hospitality association , agreed " there should be a pause " .
" migrant workers should only be allowed in if it can be proved there is an existing skill shortage - such as for chefs - and that job applicants have acceptable , proven qualifications . "
