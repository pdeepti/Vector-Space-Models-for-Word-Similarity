" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .
she said civilian planes would have " no reason to land at these airfields .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .
" we ca n't continue to look on , when there are entire sectors where there are wages that do n't provide a secure livelihood , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats , referring to nearly 2 million germans who have full-time jobs , but nevertheless live below the poverty line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six euros for some too little at the moment , only the construction industry has minimum wages .
unqualified workers earn 7.15 euros -lrb- $ 8.53 -rrb- and the scale goes up to 10.20 euros an hour .
exactly how much the minimum wage should be across different industry sectors is still up for debate . experts from the spd and the cdu / csu , which has warmed to the idea , have settled on 6 euros an hour , the first time they 've named a figure in the months the minimum wage debate has taken .
but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .
germans earn an average of 2,640 euros a month , according to 2004 statistics released this week . " people should be able to live , " said franz-josef möllenberg , head of the union representing the hospitality industry . minimum wage costs jobs an unlikely group of critics is against the concept , for different reasons .
hubertus schmoldt , the head of ig bce , which represents the chemical , mining and energy industry , said a minimum wage would mean the end of collective bargaining - one the most powerful tools of germany 's unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union for germany 's chemicals industry is against the plan at the moment , there are 3.4 million people earning less than 1,500 euros , 2.6 million earning less than 1,300 euros , and 1.3 million earning less than 1,000 , said dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers association .
the rates work out to a minimum of 6.10 euros an hour .
bringing that wage down any further would endanger millions of jobs , said hundt . " we do n't know of any minimum wage or combined wage model that does n't cost jobs , or where costs get out of control , or both , " said ludolf von wartenberg , of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , in berlin 's tagesspiegel daily . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unemployment spurs debate about solutions in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .
hertha continued its downward spiral .
the berliners had not managed a goal in the last five uefa cup matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart fought hard , but did n't come up with enough goals on thursday night , they fell quietly to rapid bucuresti , ensuring that soccer molehill , romania , will have as many representatives , two , as germany in the next round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's arrogance irks bundesliga having all but added the german championship to their trophy case , bayern munich 's domestic matches are little more than distractions in their champions league quest - it 's a situation other managers are n't happy with .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy .

" by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .

but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .
" we ca n't continue to look on , when there are entire sectors where there are wages that do n't provide a secure livelihood , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats , referring to nearly 2 million germans who have full-time jobs , but nevertheless live below the poverty line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six euros for some too little at the moment , only the construction industry has minimum wages .
unqualified workers earn 7.15 euros -lrb- $ 8.53 -rrb- and the scale goes up to 10.20 euros an hour .
exactly how much the minimum wage should be across different industry sectors is still up for debate . experts from the spd and the cdu / csu , which has warmed to the idea , have settled on 6 euros an hour , the first time they 've named a figure in the months the minimum wage debate has taken .
but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .
germans earn an average of 2,640 euros a month , according to 2004 statistics released this week . " people should be able to live , " said franz-josef möllenberg , head of the union representing the hospitality industry . minimum wage costs jobs an unlikely group of critics is against the concept , for different reasons .
hubertus schmoldt , the head of ig bce , which represents the chemical , mining and energy industry , said a minimum wage would mean the end of collective bargaining - one the most powerful tools of germany 's unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union for germany 's chemicals industry is against the plan at the moment , there are 3.4 million people earning less than 1,500 euros , 2.6 million earning less than 1,300 euros , and 1.3 million earning less than 1,000 , said dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers association .
the rates work out to a minimum of 6.10 euros an hour .
bringing that wage down any further would endanger millions of jobs , said hundt . " we do n't know of any minimum wage or combined wage model that does n't cost jobs , or where costs get out of control , or both , " said ludolf von wartenberg , of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , in berlin 's tagesspiegel daily . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unemployment spurs debate about solutions in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .
she said civilian planes would have " no reason to land at these airfields .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .
only the left-wing alliance left party came out and directly called for a new enquiry on the basis of the report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german secret service cleared in iraq affair but doubts remain a parliamentary enquiry cleared the german secret service on wednesday of charges that it helped the united states military during its strikes on iraq .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany serious about minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is one of the few sectors with a minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .
both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .
" we ca n't continue to look on , when there are entire sectors where there are wages that do n't provide a secure livelihood , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats , referring to nearly 2 million germans who have full-time jobs , but nevertheless live below the poverty line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six euros for some too little at the moment , only the construction industry has minimum wages .
unqualified workers earn 7.15 euros -lrb- $ 8.53 -rrb- and the scale goes up to 10.20 euros an hour .
exactly how much the minimum wage should be across different industry sectors is still up for debate . experts from the spd and the cdu / csu , which has warmed to the idea , have settled on 6 euros an hour , the first time they 've named a figure in the months the minimum wage debate has taken .
but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .
germans earn an average of 2,640 euros a month , according to 2004 statistics released this week . " people should be able to live , " said franz-josef möllenberg , head of the union representing the hospitality industry . minimum wage costs jobs an unlikely group of critics is against the concept , for different reasons .
hubertus schmoldt , the head of ig bce , which represents the chemical , mining and energy industry , said a minimum wage would mean the end of collective bargaining - one the most powerful tools of germany 's unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union for germany 's chemicals industry is against the plan at the moment , there are 3.4 million people earning less than 1,500 euros , 2.6 million earning less than 1,300 euros , and 1.3 million earning less than 1,000 , said dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers association .
the rates work out to a minimum of 6.10 euros an hour .
bringing that wage down any further would endanger millions of jobs , said hundt . " we do n't know of any minimum wage or combined wage model that does n't cost jobs , or where costs get out of control , or both , " said ludolf von wartenberg , of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , in berlin 's tagesspiegel daily . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unemployment spurs debate about solutions in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .
only the left-wing alliance left party came out and directly called for a new enquiry on the basis of the report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german secret service cleared in iraq affair but doubts remain a parliamentary enquiry cleared the german secret service on wednesday of charges that it helped the united states military during its strikes on iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 24.02.2006 bundesliga respectable on international stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not bad , bundesliga : hamburg and daniel van buyten advanced germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup . a cursory glance at the schedule of international soccer competitions this week would have been enough to produce beads of sweat on the foreheads of most german soccer fans .
perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .
hertha continued its downward spiral .
the berliners had not managed a goal in the last five uefa cup matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart fought hard , but did n't come up with enough goals on thursday night , they fell quietly to rapid bucuresti , ensuring that soccer molehill , romania , will have as many representatives , two , as germany in the next round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's arrogance irks bundesliga having all but added the german championship to their trophy case , bayern munich 's domestic matches are little more than distractions in their champions league quest - it 's a situation other managers are n't happy with .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy .

" by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy .

" by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .

the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .
hertha continued its downward spiral .
the berliners had not managed a goal in the last five uefa cup matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart fought hard , but did n't come up with enough goals on thursday night , they fell quietly to rapid bucuresti , ensuring that soccer molehill , romania , will have as many representatives , two , as germany in the next round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's arrogance irks bundesliga having all but added the german championship to their trophy case , bayern munich 's domestic matches are little more than distractions in their champions league quest - it 's a situation other managers are n't happy with .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .
hertha continued its downward spiral .
the berliners had not managed a goal in the last five uefa cup matches .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2006 europe 's cia investigation lacks concrete evidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia is suspected of operating flights and prisons in europe but concrete proof is missing despite receiving requested status reports from all 46 council of europe members , european investigators have yet to find any hard evidence of cia rendition flights or secret prisons . council of europe head terry davis said " appropriate action " would be taken against member states that did not take legal steps to prevent their airports being used for cia flights of terror suspects or their territory for secret detention centers . " if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's johan micoud scores the winner a furious finale , in which bremen scored two unanswered goals between the 87th minute and the final whistle , gave bremen a 3-2 victory .
" werder proved on wednesday that it had learned from -lrb- last year 's mistakes -rrb- , " wrote frank heike in the faz .
things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .
juventus turin is strong at home , and the two goals scored in bremen give the italians a leg up .
bayern munich will have to hold milan 's impressive strike team , including ukrainian andrei schevchenko , goal-less and score one themselves in order to advance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke poured it on in the second half hertha , stuttgart fall quietly bundesliga teams hamburg sv and schalke 04 , already have that part taken care of , granted in the less gilded uefa cup tournament .
the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .
hertha continued its downward spiral .
the berliners had not managed a goal in the last five uefa cup matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart fought hard , but did n't come up with enough goals on thursday night , they fell quietly to rapid bucuresti , ensuring that soccer molehill , romania , will have as many representatives , two , as germany in the next round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's arrogance irks bundesliga having all but added the german championship to their trophy case , bayern munich 's domestic matches are little more than distractions in their champions league quest - it 's a situation other managers are n't happy with .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .
" we ca n't continue to look on , when there are entire sectors where there are wages that do n't provide a secure livelihood , " said matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats , referring to nearly 2 million germans who have full-time jobs , but nevertheless live below the poverty line .

but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .
germans earn an average of 2,640 euros a month , according to 2004 statistics released this week . " people should be able to live , " said franz-josef möllenberg , head of the union representing the hospitality industry . minimum wage costs jobs an unlikely group of critics is against the concept , for different reasons .
hubertus schmoldt , the head of ig bce , which represents the chemical , mining and energy industry , said a minimum wage would mean the end of collective bargaining - one the most powerful tools of germany 's unions .

the rates work out to a minimum of 6.10 euros an hour .
bringing that wage down any further would endanger millions of jobs , said hundt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots .

the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .
she said civilian planes would have " no reason to land at these airfields .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2006 germany 's rwe keen on prolonging life of nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in biblis should be closed down in 2008 german energy giant rwe has suggested one of its nuclear plants should stay online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2008 .
is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited . " a change of policy ? although german chancellor angela merkel is committed to phasing out the remaining nuclear power plants in germany , the pro-nuclear faction in her party is dovetailing with a reviving interest in nuclear energy . several european countries have been considering its merits .
finland started work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .
only the left-wing alliance left party came out and directly called for a new enquiry on the basis of the report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german secret service cleared in iraq affair but doubts remain a parliamentary enquiry cleared the german secret service on wednesday of charges that it helped the united states military during its strikes on iraq .

perennial bundesliga strongman bayern munich had a tough assignment playing ac milan at home in the champion 's league tournament .
bremen had the unenviable task of taking on italian serie a leader juventus turin .
in the second leg of the uefa cup matches that started last week , hertha and schalke had tough away games , while hamburg and stuttgart needed strong performances at home to continue into the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing , as oliver kahn 's replacement , played a good game the results were mostly satisfying , with bayern and bremen putting on respectable performances that will encourage them for the away leg , and hamburg and schalke winning to see themselves through to the quarterfinal of the uefa cup . bayern : 45 minutes was the difference bayern 's 1-1 decision at home against ac milan will make things difficult if they hope to advance to the tournament 's quarterfinals .
though michael ballack scored a world-class goal , and bayern attacked the venerable , if aged , milan defense in the first half , they were unable to complete the job in the second .
a hand ball gave ac milan a penalty shot and the tie game .
" on a night where 45 minutes were enough to show the difference between bayern 's domination of the bundesliga and their weakness on the international level , their shaky self-confidence was only able to find strength in their complaints about the controversial penalty shot , " wrote michael horeni , in the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . bremen 's finale furiouso compared to their german colleagues several hundred miles to the north , bayern was downright stingy .
werder bremen , which last year lost at the same stage of the champion 's league tournament by an aggregate score of 2-10 , was eager to make a good showing .
after taking a surprise early lead , they gave up two quick goals in the second half , giving sports writers fresh evidence with which to criticize their vulnerable defense .

things will be tough for both bundesliga teams in italy .

the two teams made the cut into the round of 16 on thursday night .
schalke 04 dusted off espanyol barcelona away 3-0 , while hamburg managed a 2-0 at home , to see them past swiss provincial team fc thun . the other survivors into the round of 32 , stuttgart and hertha bsc berlin were less fortunate .
stuttgart managed only a 1-0 away against fc middlesborough , not enough to advance after middlesborough won 2-1 in the first leg .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .
she said civilian planes would have " no reason to land at these airfields .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought . " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " glos said .

fifa unilaterally withdrew from the discussions . unless the row is resolved in time for kick-off in germany on june 9 , fifa will be imposing a blanket ban on the use of world cup photos on the internet , including on thousands of newspaper web sites , during matches . fifa also plans to severely limit the number of photos that can be used regardless of time limits , and to impose editorial restrictions on the way photos are used in print publications . among fifa 's internet restrictions are a limit of five photos per half of each match and two photos during each half of extra time , including any subsequent penalty shootout . additionally , the german soccer clubs will be able to demand fees from radio broadcasters reporting live matches from their stadiums following a court ruling on tuesday .
the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , representing 18,000 newspapers and 11 news agencies , wrote to fifa president sepp blatter on thursday to urge him to improve access , or risk legal action the paris-based media group claims fifa 's current position will hit soccer fans hard by making it impossible for them to receive comprehensive and up to date coverage of the tournament . media claim fifa rules breach press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's media has fifa president sepp blatter in its sights " your restrictions on our journalistic coverage of the 2006 world cup not only deprive our readers and clients of access to important information on a public event , but constitute both interference in editorial freedom and independence and a clear breach of the right to information as protected by numerous international conventions , " the letter stated . it added : " we are truly saddened and shocked that in the name of maximizing the commercial exploitation of these events , fifa should effectively turn its back on the news media which give life on a daily basis to football in all its different manifestations all over the world . " monique villa , the managing director of reuters media announced her displeasure on behalf of her agency in a separate statement : " we defend the freedom of the press to report events without any restrictions .
this is our fundamental right to report news as it happens - be it soccer , politics or war - and to disseminate it on all platforms , without any distinction . " the letter , jointly signed by wan chief executive timothy balding and pierre louette , president and chief executive of agence france presse -lrb- representing also ap , reuters , getty images , dpa and epa -rrb- told blatter they would be raising the issue with the german government , world cup sponsors , and european institutions . acceptance prequisite for accreditation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some media organizations may be locked out of the world cup fifa ’ s restrictions are imposed as a condition of access to the world cup .
news media are obliged to accept the rules before gaining accreditation , and face expulsion and legal action if the restrictions are broken .
fifa says it will hold news agencies responsible if clients break the embargo or publish too many photos .
fifa says it needs the delay to protect its commercial rights holders but critics suspect the real reason may be that the organization is hoping for additional traffic to its own web site , where there would be no restriction on photographs . wan and the news agencies contend the rules are groundless because web coverage does not threaten broadcasters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mess with fifa from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .

the allegations at the center of the affair claimed that the bnd agents were in the capital to identify these targets for the us military , which the german government continues to deny . coordinates provided " not military " the report said the bnd agents did provide intelligence to the us military but that the information was mostly limited to reports about civilian-protected or other humanitarian sites , such as " synagogues and torah rolls and the possible locations of missing us pilots . " the agents also provided us counterparts with descriptions in isolated cases of iraqi military forces along with geographic coordinates , after they were convinced the americans had the information , the report said . it also said that the two agents depended on the invading us army for their safety and ability to gather intelligence and would have been in contact to ascertain their whereabouts in relation to baghdad and the german mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early us strikes targeted government buildings in baghdad " in view of the possible need for evacuation or decontamination measures the -lrb- bnd agents -rrb- would be dependent on the willingness of us authorities to cooperate , " the report stated . media reports alleged that the german agents had given the united states coordinates that could be used for bombing but the report maintained that the bnd provided " no support for the strategic air offensive " in iraq . schröder 's anti-war stance in question the affair has become a particularly sensitive subject in germany due to former chancellor gerhard schröder 's strong criticism and opposition to the war which simultaneously alienated the united states and earned schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government a second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder won a second term on the back of his anti-war rhetoric it also reflects badly on incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who has since ruled out sending troops to iraq . german opposition politicians have rejected the government 's view and have demanded a full parliamentary investigation which would require current and former government officials to testify under oath , despite the control committee 's majority vote against such action in the bundestag on wednesday . following up his comments on wednesday , chief detractor hans-christian ströbele , the green party representative on the parliamentary control committee , said : " the federal intelligence service agents have provided building coordinates which were used purely for military action . "
he reaffirmed his belief that the agents were there to pinpoint targets for destruction . the green party postponed talks on how to progress in its campaign to force a new parliamentary enquiry , while the liberal free democrats are due to meet next week to announce their own proposals .
only the left-wing alliance left party came out and directly called for a new enquiry on the basis of the report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german secret service cleared in iraq affair but doubts remain a parliamentary enquiry cleared the german secret service on wednesday of charges that it helped the united states military during its strikes on iraq .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .

but some unions say they are n't willing to accept anything below 7.50 euros , which would give workers a monthly wage of 1,300 euros before taxes .

both business and some unions reject the idea . an announcement by germany 's labor minister , franz müntefering , that he was ready to introduce a minimum wage bill to parliament later in the year has sparked heated debate in political berlin . unions have rushed to call for a high wage , while business leaders slam the idea as another job-killing proposal by germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
unlike most european countries , including france , great britain and spain , germany does n't have a minimum wage .
each industry sector negotiates wages separately through collective bargaining , but advocates say the government needs to step in to help those earning below-average wages .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought .

is germany getting ready to play with nuclear fire again ? germany 's largest energy producer , rwe , is considering submitting an application to the german government for permission to extend the life of its biblis a nuclear power plant , which was scheduled to be shut down in 2008 . ceo harry roels said on thursday rwe would apply for an extension in the second quarter of this year .
the company is hoping to use the relatively old reactor from the biblis a power plant in the german state of hesse to make up for power shortages in its other plants . the move is considered highly controversial in view of the nuclear phase-out policy which was adopted by the previous german government .
the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of nuclear power plants in germany would be shut down by 2020 . reopening the nuclear debate roels stressed that nuclear energy can not be ignored , especially in regard to the ongoing debate in germany about securing reliable energy sources for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's koch is a supporter of nuclear energy " it is time to think about the topic again - openly and candidly , " said roels . hesse 's prime minister roland koch , who is a member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he supported the move because it was in the best interest of the state to keep the plant working as long as possible . over the next 15 years , between 40,000 and 50,000 megawatts of energy that used to come from german nuclear power plants will have to be replaced with alternative energy sources . ursula hammann , a representative of the green party in the hesse parliament , said that extending the life of the biblis power plant would be irresponsible and described koch as the " chief ideologist " of nuclear economy . " a dangerous experiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental experts are concerned about nuclear waste according to greenpeace expert thomas breuer , who criticized the initiative , the biblis plant produces 50 tons of atomic waste per year and has no emergency bunker system in place . the hesse social democrats also said it would be nonsensical to extend the life of the power plant which is the " least safe , oldest , most accident-prone and least secured against plane crashes . " by rekindling the nuclear debate in hesse , roland koch is joining his party colleague and german economics minister michael glos who recently ruffled some feathers by suggesting that the german nuclear phase-out program should be given a second thought .

" if we discover such laws are not in place , or are inadequate , or are not effectively enforced , we will take appropriate action , " davis told a united nations press conference in new york . davis warned the council 's members that possible breaches of the european convention on human rights would be dealt with but did not give details . all of the council of europe 's 46 member nations have reportedly returned questionnaires on the possible transport and interrogation of terrorism suspects by the us in europe . in november , the body asked them to provide information detailing their degree of knowledge of alleged cia flights and detention centers on european soil after allegations surfaced that the cia was spiriting terror suspects away to countries where they might face harsh interrogation methods and possibly torture . five member nations - belgium , bosnia , georgia , italy and san marino - missed the feb .
21 deadline , davis said .
the answer of at least one nation was unsatisfactory and the responses of some others were brief , he said , but he refused to name them . as many as 100 suspected cases of rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty says european governments probably knew about alleged flights according to swiss senator dick marty , who is leading the investigation into alleged renditions on behalf of the council of europe , at least 100 suspects were transferred through europe by us agents to countries where they faced torture or ill treatment in recent years and it was highly likely that european governments knew about it . marty 's preliminary report stated that there was no proof so far of the existence of clandestine detention centers in romania or poland as alleged by the new york-based human rights watch . however , joanne mariner , a terrorism and counterterrorism expert for human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , told a european parliament committee on thursday that the organization continued to believe that washington had gone to great lengths to conceal any evidence of the alleged secret prisons and flights in europe .
" the us government has taken every possible step to guard the secrecy of these activities , " mariner said and echoed terry davis ' statement that european governments must ensure their military , intelligence and law enforcement officials answer all questions and provide all requested information . human rights watch accuses washington of cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has denied involvement in supporting alleged cia activity mariner acknowledged marty 's initial statement that hard evidence on secret prisons was n't available and that concrete proof of cia activities in europe remained elusive . she added that hrw had circumstantial evidence indicating the cia transported suspected terrorists to poland and romania from afghanistan , and she identified the two countries as possible hosts of secret us-run detention facilities .
but mariner admitted there was no direct proof that detainees were held in either country .
both countries have denied any involvement . " there is circumstantial evidence they were held at one point in poland and romania ...
it 's based on flights records and other circumstantial evidence .
there is very much that is in doubt , " mariner said .
" there are daunting obstacles to carry out a meaningful investigation ...
the present investigation will investigate acts that are covert and to which few persons are privy . " flight logs raise questions of possible rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 737 registration n313p is mentioned in suspect flight logs according to hrw , there are flight records pertaining to a boeing 737 , registration number n313p , which flew from kabul , afghanistan to northeastern poland on sept .
22 , 2003 , " during a period when some prisoners were secretly transferred from kabul . " mariner also gave other examples of planes that she said flew from kabul to romania and on to morocco and guantanamo .
she said civilian planes would have " no reason to land at these airfields . " the council of europe is due to announce its response to the collected information from its 46 members at the beginning of march . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigator says us exported torture via europe a european investigator has said there 's convincing evidence that washington sent detainees to third countries to be tortured but there was no " irrefutable evidence " of the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

when she took office in january 2001 , it was hoped she could help stabilise the country 's volatile politics .
but after five years as president she has little to celebrate .
the country remains mired by periodic coup rumours and natural disasters , while her social and tax reforms have paid few dividends .
high-flier born in 1947 , mrs arroyo is the daughter of diosdado macapagal , who led the philippines during the 1960s .
she was a classmate of former us president bill clinton at georgetown university in washington , and has a doctorate in economics from the university of the philippines .
mrs arroyo 's route into politics was a conventional one .
she started her government career with the department of trade and industry , and was elected into the senate in 1992 , and again in 1995 .
gloria macapagal arroyo incumbent president aged 56 accused of lacking charisma faced army mutiny in 2003 three years later she won a landslide victory to become vice-president to mr estrada .
her style could not be more different from that of mr estrada , or his friend fernando poe junior , who ran against her in the 2004 presidential election .
her sometimes cold and businesslike manner has made it difficult for her to win the support of poorer voters .
she tried to address this problem during the run-up to the 2004 presidential campaign by injecting some glamour into her campaign .
she chose as her vice-president noli de castro , who got into politics because of his experience as a news anchor .
coup attempts as is often the norm in the philippines , mrs arroyo 's time in office has been dogged by political in-fighting and rumour .
just months after she took power in place of mr estrada , his supporters stormed the gates of the presidential palace demanding she resign .
mrs arroyo managed to ride the storm , but in 2003 there was another attempt to unseat her , when more than 300 soldiers seized a manila hotel and again demanded she step down .
the rebellion was put down peacefully , but both her defence secretary and military intelligence chief resigned in the wake of the incident .
her victory in the 10 may 2004 election - announced by a congressional committee six weeks later , following a contentious vote-count - again confronted her with tough challenges , notably grinding poverty , a restive military and spiralling debt .
in 2005 , a tape recording of a phone call - apparently between mrs arroyo and an election commissioner during the previous year 's election - looked set to weaken her position .
mrs arroyo admitted she had called an election commissioner during the election , but denied trying to influence the vote , as the opposition claimed .
she rode out calls for her to resign , an attempt to impeach her , and allegations her husband , son and son-in-law were involved in influence peddling and bribe taking .
in june 2005 , her husband jose miguel - widely known as mike - moved overseas , in a move designed to silence her critics .

dutch painter rembrandt 's work is being exhibited alongside that of his italian counterpart caravaggio for the first time .
while the two artists never met , similarities are evident in their paintings such as their theatrical use of light and shade .
both artists combined astonishing naturalism with ingenious compositions of biblical and classical subjects .
rembrandt studied caravaggio 's style with teacher pieter lastman , and all three painted the sacrifice of abraham .
however , caravaggio 's clearly-defined shadows contrast with rembrandt 's diffuse lighting and exaggerated brush strokes .
in his depiction of samson , rembrandt created space by placing him diagonally , a method often used by caravaggio .
the exhibition includes work from global collections , such as the supper at emmaus from london 's national gallery .
caravaggio died four years after rembrandt was born , but the latter 's output shows he learned much from his predecessor .
more than 25 works feature in the rembrandt-caravaggio exhibition , which runs from 24 february to 18 june .

mr clarke had given the four welsh police authorities until friday to agree to a voluntary merger - but all of them have now rejected the plans .
geraint price-thomas , who chairs the gwent authority and the all-wales authority has said the pace of reform is causing the greatest concern .
but mr clarke has said a single force is the best way to police wales .
the gwent authority was the last in wales to formally reject the voluntary merger at a meeting on thursday .
i think most people think it 's a pretty half-baked report that has been sold to the home secretary and he 's rushed in malcolm king , north wales police authority all four authorities are concerned about funding , community policing and the speed of change .
on 1 march the home secretary is expected to start the legislative procedure to force the merger through , which will start a four-month consultation period .
mr price-thomas said he would keep talking to the uk government through this period but felt the position had to be made clear .
he said : " i think from time to time one has to make a stand and i 'd be the first the first to acknowledge that in law , the home secretary does have the power of now to deliver to forced merger of the four welsh forces .
more detail " having said that , we consider that it 's important from a local democratic perspective and from the point of view of our local communities that we do put a balance in and effect a reform that will be successful .
the uk government says welsh forces are currently too small " we only want to restructure once and we only want to go through this process once . "
ray thomas , chairman of south wales police authority , said the " letter was in the post " to mr clarke explaining that organisation needed more detail about the financial implication of any change .
he said the authority was not opposed to the merger in principle , but added : " certainly we 're not going down the voluntary route at this time .
we need the financial part in place first . "
but malcolm king , a member and former chairman of north wales police authority , said his authority 's concerns were more than just financial ones .
he said the hmic report which recommended the merger had been " very heavily criticised " .
mr king added : " i think most people think it 's a pretty half-baked report that has been sold to the home secretary and he 's rushed in and reached much too early conclusions from it and now he 's stuck with it " .
mr clarke has said that a single force was the only way to police wales adequately , by creating a force that would be large enough to best deal with the threats such as terrorism , drugs and organised crime .

he said the authority was not opposed to the merger in principle , but added : " certainly we 're not going down the voluntary route at this time .
we need the financial part in place first . "
but malcolm king , a member and former chairman of north wales police authority , said his authority 's concerns were more than just financial ones .
he said the hmic report which recommended the merger had been " very heavily criticised " .
mr king added : " i think most people think it 's a pretty half-baked report that has been sold to the home secretary and he 's rushed in and reached much too early conclusions from it and now he 's stuck with it " .
mr clarke has said that a single force was the only way to police wales adequately , by creating a force that would be large enough to best deal with the threats such as terrorism , drugs and organised crime .

mr clarke had given the four welsh police authorities until friday to agree to a voluntary merger - but all of them have now rejected the plans .
geraint price-thomas , who chairs the gwent authority and the all-wales authority has said the pace of reform is causing the greatest concern .
but mr clarke has said a single force is the best way to police wales .
the gwent authority was the last in wales to formally reject the voluntary merger at a meeting on thursday . "
i think most people think it 's a pretty half-baked report that has been sold to the home secretary and he 's rushed in " malcolm king , north wales police authority all four authorities are concerned about funding , community policing and the speed of change .
on 1 march the home secretary is expected to start the legislative procedure to force the merger through , which will start a four-month consultation period .
mr price-thomas said he would keep talking to the uk government through this period but felt the position had to be made clear .
he said : " i think from time to time one has to make a stand and i 'd be the first the first to acknowledge that in law , the home secretary does have the power of now to deliver to forced merger of the four welsh forces .
more detail " having said that , we consider that it 's important from a local democratic perspective and from the point of view of our local communities that we do put a balance in and effect a reform that will be successful .
" we only want to restructure once and we only want to go through this process once . "

the men volunteered to be " guinea pigs " at the government research base porton down after being told scientists wanted to find a cure for the common cold .
but they were given the hallucinogen in mind control tests , and some volunteers had terrifying hallucinations .
the foreign office said the secret intelligence body mi6 had made the settlements after legal advice .
the out-of-court settlements are thought to be under £ 10,000 for each of the men .
in a statement issued later to the bbc news website , the ministry of defence said it did not make any admission of liability in respect of the settlements .
the statement added : " the ministry of defence is very grateful to all those whose participation in studies at porton down made possible the research to provide safe and effective protection for uk armed forces . "
a spokesman for the foreign office , which oversees mi6 , said : " the settlement offers were made to the government on behalf of the three claimants which , on legal advice , and in the particular circumstances of these cases , the government thinks it appropriate to accept . "
the men had volunteered for experiments at the government 's chemical warfare research base at porton down in wiltshire in 1953 and 1954 . "
they stick to the old maxim : never apologise , never explain " don webb following the settlement , don webb , who was a 19-year-old airman at the time , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i think they grudgingly acknowledged that they did something wrong .
" they stick to the old maxim : never apologise , never explain .
but i think in this case they have decided to pay some money .
i think that is as near to an apology or an explanation i 'll get . "
both he and fellow serviceman logan marr , a former shepherd from the scottish highlands , suffered hallucinations after they were asked to drink a clear liquid .
the third man did not wish to be named .
the research was carried out after british and american governments thought the soviet union had developed a " truth drug " which could compel spies and servicemen to yield up important secrets .
mi6 scientists decided to test lsd , the closest thing they thought they had to a truth drug , on volunteers to see how they reacted .
' volunteers programme ' alan care , a lawyer who represented the three men , said : " as far as we are aware , these are the first settlements by the secret intelligence services for a personal injury action . "
he added that a request that documents relating to the case be put into the public domain had been refused .
some volunteers at the base did not find out they had been given lsd until 50 years later .
thousands of servicemen and women have volunteered in the testing of defences against chemical and biological attacks at the wiltshire military base .
research began in 1916 using a " volunteers programme " , and up to 20,000 people took part in various trials in the 50 years up to 1989 .
last october , the government was found guilty of breaching the human rights of former soldier thomas roche , who claimed he developed health problems as a result of mustard gas and nerve agent tests in 1962 and 1963 .
