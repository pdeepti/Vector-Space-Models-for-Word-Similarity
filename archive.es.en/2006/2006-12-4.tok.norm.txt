" for the first time europe will have an agency dealing with a broad range of fundamental rights , i mean promoting and protecting rights well beyond the scope of the observatory in vienna , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told journalists .
the agreement , which is awaiting dutch approval to be finalized on tuesday , is the result of long negotiations , even though heads of state and government gave their backing to the idea in december 2003 .
agency to focus on eu issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting racism will be one concern , but the agency wo n't interfere with police duties member states refused to give the new agency , which should become operational next year , powers to intervene in police and legal cooperation due to fierce opposition from britain and germany .
as a result , the agency will focus on rights issues with an eu dimension in such matters as the bloc 's single market and transportation as well as discrimination and racism .
members also tried to avoid duplicating the activities of the strasbourg-based council of europe , which monitors the application of european human rights laws in its 46 member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 04.12.2006 assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and assad held open and direct talks but the divisions were again obvious german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .
but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

" for the first time europe will have an agency dealing with a broad range of fundamental rights , i mean promoting and protecting rights well beyond the scope of the observatory in vienna , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told journalists .
the agreement , which is awaiting dutch approval to be finalized on tuesday , is the result of long negotiations , even though heads of state and government gave their backing to the idea in december 2003 .
agency to focus on eu issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting racism will be one concern , but the agency wo n't interfere with police duties member states refused to give the new agency , which should become operational next year , powers to intervene in police and legal cooperation due to fierce opposition from britain and germany .
as a result , the agency will focus on rights issues with an eu dimension in such matters as the bloc 's single market and transportation as well as discrimination and racism .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .
it came out in german under the title " neue vahr süd " in 2006 - and will hopefully be available soon in english as well . published by vintage -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , isbn 0-09944923-4 , original title : herr lehmann check dw-world.de in the future for more reviews of good german books that have recently been translated into english . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace prize awarded for children 's book on racism dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? -lrb- 01.11.2006 -rrb- wanderlust sends german words traveling what do autobahn , fest , flugelhorn , angst and gesundheit all have in common ?
you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .
you know more german words than you think you do .
-lrb- 08.08.2006 -rrb- british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .
-lrb- 13.12.2005 -rrb- will all europeans speak english ?
as english words continue to creep into other european languages dw-world readers voice their views on whether english may one day become the first language of all europeans .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni .

" lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention .

sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today .

for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .

he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders .

at a symposium in berlin on dec .

" german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today .

he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

"
any health threat is absolutely minimal so far as we can make out , added reid , who is at a two-day meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in brussels . " british police will be going to russia to continue their inquiries , " he said .
" this investigation will proceed as normal , whatever the diplomatic or wider considerations . " publicly accused putin of death by poison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko had been investigating the unsolved murder of journalist anna politkovskaya at the time of his poisoning in early november , litvinenko had been investigating the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , a fierce critic of the kremlin 's policies in chechnya , who was shot to death in her moscow apartment building .
from his deathbed , litvinenko , a former intelligence agent of the kgb 's successor agency , the federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- had publicly fingered russian president vladimir putin , for ordering his death .
litvinenko , who acquired british citizenship this year , had lived in exile in london among some 300,000 russian emigres , many who are former defectors or wealthy tycoons . litvinenko 's father told moscow 's kommersant daily , that he was sure that president vladimir putin was involved in the death of his son .
" there was an order right from the top to kill , " said walter litvinenko , who added his son had requested a muslim burial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for his son 's death putin , who had previously served as a kgb officer in the former east germany and formerly headed the fsb , called litvenenko 's death tragic , but said in a statement on friday , " this is not a violent death , so there is no ground for speculation . " putin implicated by chechen exile a chechen exile , ahmed sakayev , who was a close friend and had taken litvenenko home on the day of the poisoning had also implicated putin and former kgb colleagues in an interview with the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . " an operation of this scale would not take place without clearance from the top authority of the russian state , " he said . an italian contact , mario scaramella a security expert and academic , has also been contaminated with polonium 210 after linking up with litvinenko in a sushi bar following the millennium hotel meeting . " i have an amount of polonium in my body which is five times higher than the dose considered deadly , " he said in a telephone interview aired by italy 's rai 1 television .
still scaramella had not ingested any food or drink at the sushi bar and the results of his pathology tests to date remain normal , according to a spokesman at london 's university college hospital . italian contact expected to make information public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian academic mario scaramella tested positive for polonium 210 after meeting with litvinenko scaramella 's lawyer , claudio rastrelli said over the weekend on italian television that his client plans to make information that litvinenko passed to him public . the kremlin has fully denied any involvement in the poisoning and has promised to cooperate with the british investigation . british home secretary reid said he was confident that moscow was cooperating with the investigation , but the sunday times reported that british foreign secretary margaret beckett had told senior ministers that putin was angered at britain 's failure to gag litvinenko after he was poisoned . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators find traces of radiation on british planes investigators examining the events surrounding the poisoning of a former russian spy found traces of radiation on two british airways planes .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 04.12.2006 assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and assad held open and direct talks but the divisions were again obvious german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .
but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .

for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .

interested in german literature ?
dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .

and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility .

it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? -lrb- 01.11.2006 -rrb- wanderlust sends german words traveling what do autobahn , fest , flugelhorn , angst and gesundheit all have in common ?
you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .
you know more german words than you think you do .
-lrb- 08.08.2006 -rrb- british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" this law can not stand , " he said in reference to the reforms .
" when more than 40 organizations from the health occupations form an alliance to protest this , then something must not be right . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " hoppe said , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals .
he urged the government to rethink the reforms before it was too late . klaus vater , the spokesperson for the federal health ministry , in turn warned doctors not to take any further action and that no amount of protest would reverse the decision over the health reforms . germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in red ink .

however , numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . protestors took to the streets on monday in several states and surgeries and pharmacists were closed as the " patients in need " day of industrial action took hold .
numerous medical practices and drugstores remained closed in north rhine-westphalia and baden-württemberg .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements .

4 , 2001 and shook germany to the core . while they had long taken pride in an excellent school system , germans suddenly had to realize that a large percentage of students had failed basic reading comprehension tests .
newspapers proclaimed an " education catastrophe " while politicians struggled to find ways to solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa 's not only giving students a headache the study led to more cooperation between germany 's federal states , which each have sovereignty when it comes to education .
but many education experts believe that the measures taken do not go far enough . a main problem that continues to exist is the division of germany 's secondary education into three different school types , which means the academic careers of many students is already decided on at age 10 .
especially children from migrant and lower class families end up in the least challenging school type . university or unemployment ? the deputy leader of germany 's teachers ' union , marianne demmer , said it was time to end this kind of discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many education experts believe that they should not be separated at a young age " that 's only possible if children at the age of 10 are no longer distributed in school types that are challenging to various degrees , " demmer told dpa news service .
" one type leads to a high school diploma , the other results in unemployment . " others , such as germany 's pisa coordinator , manfred prenzel , called on people to be more patient as reforms take effect .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements . " we are negotiating six economic partnership agreements that are basically ftas , " said fraser . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls on china to open markets the european union said tuesday accusing china of not doing enough to encourage free trade , saying trade needed to be a " two-way street " and warning of a possible backlash if trade is n't opened .

any health threat is absolutely minimal so far as we can make out , added reid , who is at a two-day meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in brussels . " british police will be going to russia to continue their inquiries , " he said .
" this investigation will proceed as normal , whatever the diplomatic or wider considerations .

from his deathbed , litvinenko , a former intelligence agent of the kgb 's successor agency , the federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- had publicly fingered russian president vladimir putin , for ordering his death .
litvinenko , who acquired british citizenship this year , had lived in exile in london among some 300,000 russian emigres , many who are former defectors or wealthy tycoons . litvinenko 's father told moscow 's kommersant daily , that he was sure that president vladimir putin was involved in the death of his son .
" there was an order right from the top to kill , " said walter litvinenko , who added his son had requested a muslim burial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for his son 's death putin , who had previously served as a kgb officer in the former east germany and formerly headed the fsb , called litvenenko 's death tragic , but said in a statement on friday , " this is not a violent death , so there is no ground for speculation . " putin implicated by chechen exile a chechen exile , ahmed sakayev , who was a close friend and had taken litvenenko home on the day of the poisoning had also implicated putin and former kgb colleagues in an interview with the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . " an operation of this scale would not take place without clearance from the top authority of the russian state , " he said . an italian contact , mario scaramella a security expert and academic , has also been contaminated with polonium 210 after linking up with litvinenko in a sushi bar following the millennium hotel meeting . " i have an amount of polonium in my body which is five times higher than the dose considered deadly , " he said in a telephone interview aired by italy 's rai 1 television .
still scaramella had not ingested any food or drink at the sushi bar and the results of his pathology tests to date remain normal , according to a spokesman at london 's university college hospital . italian contact expected to make information public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian academic mario scaramella tested positive for polonium 210 after meeting with litvinenko scaramella 's lawyer , claudio rastrelli said over the weekend on italian television that his client plans to make information that litvinenko passed to him public . the kremlin has fully denied any involvement in the poisoning and has promised to cooperate with the british investigation . british home secretary reid said he was confident that moscow was cooperating with the investigation , but the sunday times reported that british foreign secretary margaret beckett had told senior ministers that putin was angered at britain 's failure to gag litvinenko after he was poisoned . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators find traces of radiation on british planes investigators examining the events surrounding the poisoning of a former russian spy found traces of radiation on two british airways planes .

" for the first time europe will have an agency dealing with a broad range of fundamental rights , i mean promoting and protecting rights well beyond the scope of the observatory in vienna , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told journalists .
the agreement , which is awaiting dutch approval to be finalized on tuesday , is the result of long negotiations , even though heads of state and government gave their backing to the idea in december 2003 .
agency to focus on eu issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting racism will be one concern , but the agency wo n't interfere with police duties member states refused to give the new agency , which should become operational next year , powers to intervene in police and legal cooperation due to fierce opposition from britain and germany .
as a result , the agency will focus on rights issues with an eu dimension in such matters as the bloc 's single market and transportation as well as discrimination and racism .
members also tried to avoid duplicating the activities of the strasbourg-based council of europe , which monitors the application of european human rights laws in its 46 member states .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent .

dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .

" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .
it came out in german under the title " neue vahr süd " in 2006 - and will hopefully be available soon in english as well . published by vintage -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , isbn 0-09944923-4 , original title : herr lehmann check dw-world.de in the future for more reviews of good german books that have recently been translated into english . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace prize awarded for children 's book on racism dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner .

erotic readings , fashion shows and a unique type of karaoke , where participants dub a porn movie , are also on offer . " you should down a few glasses of glühwein before participating , " said olivia jones , a well-known transvestite .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements . " we are negotiating six economic partnership agreements that are basically ftas , " said fraser . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls on china to open markets the european union said tuesday accusing china of not doing enough to encourage free trade , saying trade needed to be a " two-way street " and warning of a possible backlash if trade is n't opened .

a santa claus with a whip makes sure that only adults enter this special area , where " angels " and " santa clauses " disrobe themselves .
erotic readings , fashion shows and a unique type of karaoke , where participants dub a porn movie , are also on offer . " you should down a few glasses of glühwein before participating , " said olivia jones , a well-known transvestite .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? -lrb- 01.11.2006 -rrb- wanderlust sends german words traveling what do autobahn , fest , flugelhorn , angst and gesundheit all have in common ?
you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .

didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out . anglicisms , spelling reform and falling tests scores in schools - all of these bugbears come up when germans discuss the significance of their language .
however , the german language is not only under influence but , increasingly , it is also making an impact of its own beyond the german borders . a few months ago , the online magazine berliner gazette spearheaded a new project they called mcdeutsch , or " mcgerman . "
around 50 cultural experts based both in germany and abroad hope to contribute to the national debate and create a global perspective .
at a symposium in berlin on dec .
15 , they 'll delve more deeply into the matter . " german is not only spoken in germany , austria and switzerland , " says krystian woznicki , the project 's artistic director , who called the german language an export hit on a global level . the linguistic process of globalization does not mean that the language imposes itself everywhere like mcdonalds , as some say , but that " it spreads in different ways and at the same time also takes in the world in different ways , " added woznicki . back to colonialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children try to get their heads around the new spelling reforms the language-globalization project has selected two experts from america and two from africa . the biggest german immigration waves took place in the us and germany had its most significant colonies in africa , said woznicki , and the influences can still be felt today . " for many people in the former german colonies , german is very highly-valued , " said the director of togo 's goethe institute , herwig kempf .
" many togolese or cameroonians associate the german language with nostalgia for the past , for the good old german colonial times . " actively , german tends to be used principally at universities by people who intend to study or work in germany . german roots in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steuben-parade - a german tradition in new york as for the us , some 50 million americans are of german origin .
only the english and irish have more descendents in the us . although most americans with german ancestors do n't speak or understand german , many have kept a connection with their roots . " we have many " heritage speakers , " especially here in the midwest - that is , students whose families have german roots , " says yasemin yildiz , junior professor at the university of illinois . the 37-year-old german scholar was born in turkey and grew up in bremen in northern germany .
for her , the globalization of a language simply means that it changes .
within germany itself this is a process that many still perceive as worrying . " the feeling is that the german language is being threatened and has to be rescued , instead of it being perceived as a living entity which changes and is dynamic , " she says . pragmatic means of communication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hip-hop musicians lend modernity to the language of goethe but what does it mean for a language to pick up on influences ? " these are challenges which speakers have to set themselves , " says afro-german rapper and linguist kofi yakpo .
he has often come across the prejudice that people who are not white ca n't master the german language . but in germany every sixth person is of immigrant origin , so german can no longer be linked with ethnic identity . " the german language is transforming itself from a national symbol that provides an identity to the white , non-migrant majority into a pragmatic means of communication , and thus a modern definition of nation , " says yakpo . german will never be as big of an export hit as english , but the project is not about comparing the two , rather about showing that other languages are also spreading past their national borders . " it would be unfair and boring only to have english as an example of language globalization , " said woznicki . birgit adolf -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? -lrb- 01.11.2006 -rrb- wanderlust sends german words traveling what do autobahn , fest , flugelhorn , angst and gesundheit all have in common ?
you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .

" this law can not stand , " he said in reference to the reforms .
" when more than 40 organizations from the health occupations form an alliance to protest this , then something must not be right . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " hoppe said , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals .
he urged the government to rethink the reforms before it was too late . klaus vater , the spokesperson for the federal health ministry , in turn warned doctors not to take any further action and that no amount of protest would reverse the decision over the health reforms . germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in red ink .

however , numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . protestors took to the streets on monday in several states and surgeries and pharmacists were closed as the " patients in need " day of industrial action took hold .
numerous medical practices and drugstores remained closed in north rhine-westphalia and baden-württemberg .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" for the first time europe will have an agency dealing with a broad range of fundamental rights , i mean promoting and protecting rights well beyond the scope of the observatory in vienna , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told journalists .
the agreement , which is awaiting dutch approval to be finalized on tuesday , is the result of long negotiations , even though heads of state and government gave their backing to the idea in december 2003 .
agency to focus on eu issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting racism will be one concern , but the agency wo n't interfere with police duties member states refused to give the new agency , which should become operational next year , powers to intervene in police and legal cooperation due to fierce opposition from britain and germany .
as a result , the agency will focus on rights issues with an eu dimension in such matters as the bloc 's single market and transportation as well as discrimination and racism .
members also tried to avoid duplicating the activities of the strasbourg-based council of europe , which monitors the application of european human rights laws in its 46 member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.12.2006 european commission sees huge gains in new trade deals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade commissioner peter mandelson wants europe to increase its competitiveness the european commission is due to launch plans for a " new generation " of free trade agreements this week by seeking mandates for talks with asean , south korea and india as well as andean and central american countries . with the so-called doha round of wto negotiations stalled , the mandates highlight eu trade commissioner peter mandelson 's new trade strategy , based on a " more rigorous " calculation of the possible economic gains from such deals . eu foreign ministers are to pronounce on the package on dec .
11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements . " we are negotiating six economic partnership agreements that are basically ftas , " said fraser . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls on china to open markets the european union said tuesday accusing china of not doing enough to encourage free trade , saying trade needed to be a " two-way street " and warning of a possible backlash if trade is n't opened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 04.12.2006 assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and assad held open and direct talks but the divisions were again obvious german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .
but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .

everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .

interested in german literature ?
dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .

dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .

" this law can not stand , " he said in reference to the reforms .
" when more than 40 organizations from the health occupations form an alliance to protest this , then something must not be right .

everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

it 's not that all that bad , is it ?
everybody needs a hug sometimes .
unfortunately there is n't always someone there to oblige .
but that 's what the free hugs campaign is about .
however , berlin 's free huggers got the cold shoulder from locals this weekend . the weather gets colder , the skies get greyer and the days get shorter .
winter in germany is slowly settling in and the faces are dropping faster than the temperatures .
one would think that as the year comes to an end , the german public would welcome a comforting cuddle .
not so .
a campaign intended to spread the love on an international scale has come undone on berlin 's hardened streets . seven men and women set up the berlin version of an international craze for " free hugs " on alexanderplatz , berlin 's biggest square , over the weekend . the berlin team set up the service after an internet forum , hospitality club , announced simultaneous hugging would take place on saturday in a number of european cities including düsseldorf , lyon , warsaw and helsinki . too cool for a cuddle however , the german team did n't factor in the possibility that the notoriously cool and detached berliners would avoid such random displays of public hugging like a dose of the plague .
even attempts to get the hugging ball rolling by cuddling each other did n't bring any pedestrians over to join the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " come here , you big softie ! "
eventually a few brave souls volunteered to be hugged by the berlin team , only to be exposed as tourists from outside germany .
meanwhile , berlin 's trendies went about their business by giving the huggers a wide berth . global campaign to spread the love the free hugs campaign was started by australian juan mann who , on arrival in his home town of sydney after time away in london , found that things had changed for him .
feeling alone and like a tourist in his own city , mann says on the campaign website that he just needed someone to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay .
so he started his campaign to spread a little joy around the globe . aided by the youtube video consolidating web site - on which the australian posted a film of a man wearing a " free hugs " placard as he walks up a street and hugs strangers - mann 's campaign took off round the world and became a global phenomenon .

interested in german literature ?
dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .
it came out in german under the title " neue vahr süd " in 2006 - and will hopefully be available soon in english as well . published by vintage -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , isbn 0-09944923-4 , original title : herr lehmann check dw-world.de in the future for more reviews of good german books that have recently been translated into english . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace prize awarded for children 's book on racism dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner .

read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .

interested in german literature ?
dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .
michael hofmann , who translated the poems , has been criticized for perhaps taking too much poetic and linguistic liberty in his english version , at times offering two translations for a given phrase or using idioms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein has received many awards for his work the us publication , however , is bi-lingual , offering the english and german versions face-to-face for those who read at least a bit of grünbein 's native language .
his poetry is an essential part of contemporary german literature and hofmann 's translation is - at the very least - a worthwhile compromise . critics think so too : the new york times book review called ashes for breakfast a " brilliantly layered book " with " organic sensibility . " published by farrar , straus and giroux -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , isbn 0-37426074-5 , original title : grauzone morgens -lrb- 1988 -rrb- and other collections - berlin blues by sven regener sven regener 's " berlin blues " is a highlight of recent pop literature in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regener tempers ennui with a healthy dose of comedy under its original title " herr lehmann , " regener 's comical and sympathetic tale of an ordinary guy in berlin quickly hit the german best-seller list in 2001 .
it was also made into a popular film and regener won a german film award in 2004 for the screenplay . it 's 1989 , berlin .
frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .
regener 's success lies in his ability to shape a unique and even lovable character out of an everyman and portray the banal ennui of an everyman , with the explosive political situation of the late-1980s faintly in the background . " lehmann 's world is so 36 , and nothing else , " wrote the german daily der tagesspiegel .
perhaps there 's something universal about a mid-life crisis .
german weekly die zeit called regener 's main character " a pale man in a loud world " and " a philosopher in a carp pond . " indeed , lehmann encounters one misfortune after another - a vicious dog , nagging parents , difficult girlfriends , and a depressed friend - but his post-modern sense of indifference pulls him through every time , practically unscathed . do n't expect any social commentary on former east germany or reunification from regener , who has another career as the lead singer and song-writer for the german rock band elements of crime .
it 's the effortless characterization , brilliant dialog and dry comic elements that make this book a winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author sven regener is also a rock star after the success of berlin blues , regener got to work writing two prequels .
the first of them takes place nine years prior to berlin blues .
it came out in german under the title " neue vahr süd " in 2006 - and will hopefully be available soon in english as well . published by vintage -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , isbn 0-09944923-4 , original title : herr lehmann check dw-world.de in the future for more reviews of good german books that have recently been translated into english . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace prize awarded for children 's book on racism dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner .
-lrb- 18.11.2006 -rrb- american author 's nazi novel wins france 's top literary prize american jonathan littell , won france 's top literary prize , the goncourt , for his french novel " les bienveillantes " about a fictional german ss officer 's memoirs .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- schröder 's memoirs anger some , bore many trade union leaders and conservatives may be irritated by excerpts from the former chancellor 's memoirs , but the german press says by and large there 's little to get excited about .

11 , which would allow initial negotiations to get under way in mid-2007 if they give their approval . the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm , hopes that by presenting its requests for mandates en bloc it will be more difficult for member states to nit-pick over individual countries or regions , blocking the process . the commission is eager to get to work on the accords because it estimates huge possible commercial gains , which can be reaped by cutting trade barriers with the countries . in the case of south korea , the head of mandelson 's office simon fraser recently said , " economic analysis we have done shows that there is an opportunity to increase our trade by 30 percent . " europe wants to keep up with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has already reached out to south korea with washington already in the midst of negotiations with seoul , brussels does not want to be left out in the cold . the countries and regions targeted by the free trade agreements -lrb- ftas -rrb- , all developing or medium level income countries , are equally eager to forge such deals with europe .
" india has been pushing very hard for such a deal , " said fraser . along with china , for which the eu has a separate trade strategy , asean , india and south korea make up the bulk of the emerging asia region , where european trade interests are still weak . the eu chose to focus on a multilateral approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral deals .
bilateral talks underway at the time , such as with the mercosur countries of south america and the gulf states , later stalled in part because the focus shifted to the wto negotiations . bilateral deals the way forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade rep rob portman favors bilateral deals however , since the wto talks ground to a halt in july over eu and us intransigence on cutting agriculture subsidies , brussels decided to give a new push to bilateral deals , a strategy already being pursued by the united states and japan . officially , concluding the doha round remains the eu 's main priority , but some of its main trade interests have been dropped from the negotiations , encouraging brussels to seek other means to reach its ends . " the singapore issues are exactly the issues we want to tackle with india , asean and south korea , " an eu official said in reference to wto talks within the doha round on investment , competition policy , and public procurement , which were abandoned in 2003 . easy to say , not so easy to implement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu maintains its focus on africa will not be affected despite brussels ' eagerness to get a deal with asean , the commission also recognizes that reaching an agreement with a grouping as diverse and relatively little integrated will not be easy . " the one with korea is likely to be an easier one than asean , " the official said .
as in the case with india , south korea does not have agriculture interests that will likely be a cause of concern for some of the eu 's member states . meanwhile , the commission insists that it is not turning its back on poor african , caribbean and pacific countries that were the main beneficiaries of its " old generation " of free-trade agreements . " we are negotiating six economic partnership agreements that are basically ftas , " said fraser . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu calls on china to open markets the european union said tuesday accusing china of not doing enough to encourage free trade , saying trade needed to be a " two-way street " and warning of a possible backlash if trade is n't opened .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .

frank lehmann is a chaotic , aimless bar-tender who has managed not to succumb to the expectations of his parents , landlord , neighbors and girlfriends .

dw-world.de has selected some great german books that have recently become available in english translation .
read on ! after the wall by jana hensel " i got my first pair of acid-washed jeans just after the wall fell , " wrote jana hensel in " after the wall . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jana hensel shares the struggles of assimilating after german reunification hensel was 13 years and three months old when the berlin wall came down on nov .
9 , 1989 , the day she said her childhood ended .
the book is both a memoir and an analysis of the generation that integrated into the west with apparent ease . like her peers , hensel spent her early years coveting things from the " other side " - acid-washed jeans , western chocolate , fancy cars .
at the same time , a giant portrait of karl marx hung in her school classroom and she was taught to be suspect of children who brought bananas in their lunchboxes or came from single-parent homes . when the wall fell , not just hensel 's country but everything she knew was swallowed up by the federal republic of germany .
she no longer recognized her home town of leipzig , where people started sporting top western fashions , eating at mcdonald 's and speaking western slang . the author was also among those who adapted at lightening speed , dropped her saxon accent and quickly became embarrassed by her parents , who seemed to have been left behind in an obsolete culture .
by capturing the everyday in a loose , authentic style , hensel manages to convey nostalgia for her youth without being overly sentimental .
despite the initial euphoria of reunification and the sudden abundance of everything east german children had coveted for so long , the process of assimilation that took place in the early 1990s was also accompanied by a nearly unnoticed sense of loss , which is precisely what hensel draws attention to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just 30 , hensel already has a booming career as a writer the 30-year-old author wrote the book " because there was a gap in german literature that has to be filled about how young people feel about what is happening , " she said in an interview for the goethe institute .
" our world changed from one day to the next . " the former east germany is so often painted in shades of grey , with secret service agents lurking around every corner .
but hensel 's memoir offers a refreshing and realistic perspective that is neither apologetic nor sensationalized . published by public affairs -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , isbn 1-5864826-61 , original title : zonenkinder - ashes for breakfast : selected poems by durs grünbein durs grünbein , is widely considered to be one of germany 's most remarkable contemporary poets .
using simple language and startling visual effects , the 46-year-old dresden native addresses the urgent moral concerns of his post-war generation : environmental degradation , historical reconciliation and suffering , to name a few . take the title piece from ashes for breakfast : on the daily newspapers i have breakfasted on ashes , the black dust that comes off newspapers , from the freshly printed columns .
when a coup makes no stain and a tornado sticks to half a page .
and it seems to me as though the fates licked their lips when war broke out in the sports section , reflected in the falling dow .
i have breakfasted on ashes .
my daily bread .
and clio , as ever , keeps mum … there , just as i folded them up the rustling pages sent a shiver down my spine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grünbein 's first collection in english " on daily newspapers " is exemplary of the rich layers found in grünbein 's work - from the tangible banal to critical philosophizing on global issues . speaking of banal , animals turn up frequently in the collection .
each poem in the five-part sequence called " in the province , " for example , describes an instance of road-kill or other painful form of death .
there are also four poems on zoo animals -lrb- a chimpanzee , an okapi , a penguin , and a cheetah -rrb- and " a portrait of the artist as a young border dog . "
the final piece in the collection , " arcadia for all , " " makes the old theme of man 's dream for an earthly paradise explicit , " as a reviewer from the goethe institute put it . ashes for breakfast , a collection of poems taken from five different volumes published between 1988 and 2002 , is the first to appear in english translation .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states . " but he added that germany will nonetheless face " very high expectations " at the head of the eu . the bloc in coming months has to cope with the setback in turkey 's membership bid while trying to salvage its bitterly-contested draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

" it -lrb- the warsaw government -rrb- is isolating poland within the european union , " deputy foreign minister gernot erler said . andreas maurer from the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- said the row was giving merkel an opportunity to show that she can " act as a neutral broker " between russia and poland , the biggest of the new , mainly former communist eu members . but he added that for berlin , it was " easy to negotiate on behalf of poland but difficult to negotiate with poland . " tensions between germany and poland increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski exploited anti-german feelings in poland relations between berlin and warsaw have never been warm because of lingering tension over world war ii , which kaczynski exploited to win election , but have worsened since 2003 when poland backed the us-led invasion of iraq . warsaw is also angry because it will lose transfer fees as a result of a pipeline being built in the baltic sea to pump gas directly from russia to germany and resents a drive to win recognition for the plight of germans who were expelled from former german territory , now part of poland , as the third reich collapsed . tuesday 's summit follows a failed attempt earlier this year to convene the three leaders for the traditional " weimar triangle " meeting between their countries , which was first held in 1991 . kaczynski backed out in july at the height of a row with berlin over negative coverage in the german press , and has publicly questioned the usefulness of the weimar meetings . franco-german engine running out of steam ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observer 's say the axis is losing its importance maurer said the polish president was not the only skeptic , " the french-german tandem has largely lost its importance , and it is now being called into doubt by the eastern member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 04.12.2006 assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and assad held open and direct talks but the divisions were again obvious german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .
but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

but assad held a belligerent stance , blaming israel for current tensions . " i call particularly on syria to do everything in its power to prevent the destabilisation of lebanon , directly or indirectly , " steinmeier told reporters , according to an official translation of his remarks from german to arabic . " the region is in a difficult transitional phase and is anything but stable , " the german foreign minister said .
" i was in lebanon and witnessed the fragile situation , in particular after the assassination of pierre gemayel . " he added that syria was an " important actor " in the middle east that he hoped could play a " constructive " part in the peace process and said " all parties should make every effort to prevent increased violence in lebanon . "
steinmeier held talks with syrian counterpart walid al-moallem and president bashar al-assad on the latest leg of his tour of the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with israeli counterpart tzipi livni during a two-hour discussion with assad , steinmeier urged the syrian president to use his influence on hezbollah to diffuse the current tensions in lebanon .
sources within the german delegation told associated press that the discussions had been open and direct . steinmeier and president assad also spoke about the situation between israel and the palestinians , with the german minister pressing for assad 's assistance in tempering unrest within the gaza strip through his connections with khaled maschaal , the exiled political leader of hamas in damascus . in berlin , foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reporters steinmeier would also " deliver a political message " from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora to syria , asking it to " exercise a moderating influence on hezbollah . " assad reiterates stance on israel as an " enemy " after the meeting , however , assad spoke only of the divisions within the region and laid the blame for the current tensions at the doors of israel and the united states . " the usa and israel are far away from any peace , " assad said .
" israel is our enemy and does not want peace .
peace would mean that israel would have to return the occupied territories again .
israel was built on aggression and the rejection of peace , and nothing changes . " " people always say that you need the united states for peace , to stabilize , because of its position as a military world power and its diplomatic relations with many different states , " the president continued .
" however , the united states have to answer for this war .
this is the opposite of having the will for peace . " assad 's comments monday echoed those made in august shortly before steinmeier and he were supposed to meet . five months ago , steinmeier cancelled a visit to damascus hours before his planned arrival after assad described israel as " an enemy , " said it was an honor for syria to support shiite militia hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier meets with livni in jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah supporters want the lebanese cabinet to resign steinmeier left for damascus after talks in israel , which has occupied the syrian golan heights since 1967 , with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . " a trip like this only makes sense if one uses it to leave clear messages behind , " he told reporters at a brief news conference with livni in jerusalem on sunday . " lebanon must have a chance to develop based on its own domestic forces and that can only happen when outside interference is ruled out , " steinmeier added . the german minister 's middle east tour has come at a time of heightened tensions in the region , despite the continuing adherence to two ceasefires between the israelis and the palestinians in gaza , and the hezbollah militia in lebanon . the trip , which started in jordan on friday and took steinmeier through the west bank , gaza , beirut and cyprus , almost unraveled when it came to beirut due to the continued protests of thousands of pro-syrian protesters installed outside government buildings calling for the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . critics see syria 's hand in current unrest western critics claim that assad 's syria is responsible for stirring the current discontent and allege that the hand of damascus continues to push for hezbollah 's increased , if not total , presence in the lebanese government . steinmeier 's visit is the first to syria by a senior german government official in more than two years and it is expected that he will make the most of it by taking a tough stance . on saturday in beirut , steinmeier met lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and pledged that germany would support " lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " however , while steinmeier talked frankly about lebanon while in syria , his discussions did not contain any measure of threat . germany pursues constructive dialogue with damascus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political killings in beirut have been blamed on syria berlin has frequently indicated that it is prepared to offer economic incentives to damascus in exchange for " constructive " cooperation in middle east peace efforts and steinmeier himself has repeatedly said during his tour that syria 's positive involvement in the region is integral to finding a lasting settlement . other leading western powers have sought to isolate damascus over its alleged role in last year 's assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri in beirut while critics also accuse it of assassinating anti-syrian cabinet minister pierre gemayel 12 days ago .
the syrian government denies involvement in the killings . syrian foreign minister al-moallem slammed what he said were efforts to isolate syria . " there are parties in the world who have isolated syria , but we want solid relations with every country in the world , especially germany , based on common understanding and non-interference in -lrb- syrian -rrb- internal affairs , " he said . still , syria is increasingly seen in europe as a key to solving the myriad inter-woven conflicts in the region and , as germany takes over the rotating presidency of the european union less than a month from now , steinmeier is looking to lay the foundations of potential progress in the coming months . berlin will be involved in the middle east quartet of peace mediators , comprising the united states , russia , the united nations and the eu . steinmeier has vowed to revive the ailing quartet 's plans and assured israeli foreign minister livni on sunday that germany would actively support efforts to forge peace in the region , saying the fragile ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip offered a " glimmer of hope " for the whole region . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to visit damascus for talks with assad four months after abruptly axing a trip to damascus , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to syria monday to hold talks with president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid muallem .

this week we look at how much has changed since then .
five years ago , on a cold winter 's day in kabul , news broke that a new afghan leader had been chosen thousands of miles away in the german city of bonn .
i reached for a satellite telephone to call hamid karzai , still battling against taleban forces in their last redoubt in the south .
" am i the new chairman ? " he shouted on a crackling line .
on a morning when he had come under fire from misguided american aircraft , hamid karzai still had not been told officially .
" that 's nice , " was his unassuming reply .
afghans have , in some ways , made an impressive journey since a hastily assembled group of afghans and foreign envoys forged what became known as the bonn process .
with some difficulty and delay all the ambitious targets were met : a traditional assembly , or loya jirga , approved a new government in 2002 ; a second loya jirga came up with a constitution ; and presidential and parliamentary elections were held for the first time in decades .
we are too late , too bureaucratic , and frankly we spend too much money on ourselves rather than developing the skills of afghan lakhdar brahmini , former un envoy listen to lyse doucet here but for many afghans it is a job half done .
" we reached the quantity of targets , but the quality is still missing , " says nader nadery , an observer at the bonn conference who is now a commissioner at afghanistan 's independent human rights commission .
afghanistan is still a place awash with guns , where commanders and local officials can impose their will with impunity , where many afghans say their lives have changed little .
most startling of all , the taleban have made a comeback in the south , fighting with unexpected ferocity and firepower .
there is no doubting some progress , but why did billions of dollars in aid and thousands of foreign troops not make more of a difference ?
fighting in afghanistan continues to attract international criticism i have put this question in recent weeks to many of the players who helped shape afghanistan over the past five years .
former afghan finance minister ashraf ghani insists the world 's aid agencies simply were not equipped for state building in an impoverished country emerging from a quarter century of war .
even lakhdar brahimi , who presided over much of this process as the un 's senior envoy , offers a scathing verdict on the performance of the un and donors .
" the way we are doing it is really lousy .
we are too late , too bureaucratic , and frankly we spend too much money on ourselves rather than developing the skills of afghans , " he says .
most critically for mr brahimi and many others , countries who vowed to " stand by afghanistan for the long run " did n't send enough troops in 2002 to start rebuilding , including disarmament , across the country .
only 5,000 soldiers were sent to kabul while 8,000 us troops concentrated on rooting out remnants of the taleban and al-qaeda .
mr brahimi speaks of a " great deal of bitterness " that resources were then suddenly found for a war in iraq .
' police reform is now on top of us military agenda ' " in 2002 , the warlords and commanders were shaking in their boots fearing they were going to be disarmed or cast aside , " recalls francesc vendrell , the former un envoy who is the now the eu 's man in kabul .
" now it 's much more difficult . "
five years on , afghanistan 's powerful regional leaders no longer command private armies but in province after province , men with guns now have access to state resources and positions of power .
huge cracks have been exposed in this state building exercise. including the failure to focus enough attention on rebuilding institutions like the judiciary and police .
" ten good police are better than 100 corrupt police and 10 corrupt police can do more damage to our success than one taleban extremist , " explains lt general karl eikenberry , the senior us commander .
he has now put police reform at the top of the us military 's agenda after years of a german-led effort which concentrated mainly on training .
government failings also fuel the rise of taleban and other opposition forces .
president karzai is often blamed for making poor choices when it comes to appointing provincial governors and police chiefs .
' big tent ' in an interview at his heavily guarded presidential palace , he admits " there are things i would have done differently " .
but he rejects criticism that he still relies too heavily on advice from former mujahideen factional leaders blamed for the destruction of kabul during the civil war of the 1990s .
his political signature has been " the big tent " approach .
but what mr karzai views as a wise strategy to bring everyone on board , others see as a sign of weakness .
many express regret over other missed opportunities .
lakhdar brahimi worries that he and others were wrong not to bring the taleban into the political process as early as 2002 .
many say afghanistan did not get enough aid former us envoy to afghanistan zalmay khalilzad told me he wished more attention had been paid to taleban " sanctuaries " across the border in pakistan .
five years on , there is consensus on an urgent need to get a grip on the situation .
it is more difficult now with the emergence of a new " mafia " : a nexus of drug smugglers , criminals , and in some provinces taleban , filling a vacuum left by the government .
nato forces are now acutely aware their fight is also about jobs and reconstruction .
as general eikenberry puts it : " where the road ends , the taleban begins " .
as another harsh winter closes in , long cold nights without electricity , even in kabul , concentrate afghan minds .
spring must bring not just a reprieve from winter 's icy blast , but clear signs that their government , backed by nato forces and major donors , is heading in the right direction .

five years on , there is consensus on an urgent need to get a grip on the situation .
it is more difficult now with the emergence of a new " mafia " : a nexus of drug smugglers , criminals , and in some provinces taleban , filling a vacuum left by the government .
nato forces are now acutely aware their fight is also about jobs and reconstruction .
as general eikenberry puts it : " where the road ends , the taleban begins " .
as another harsh winter closes in , long cold nights without electricity , even in kabul , concentrate afghan minds .
spring must bring not just a reprieve from winter 's icy blast , but clear signs that their government , backed by nato forces and major donors , is heading in the right direction .

health correspondent eleanor bradford explains the background to her investigation and why disturbing evidence is emerging that all is not well in scotland 's newest hospitals . "
it 's the million dollar question : how do we improve the nhs ?
it 's an institution held dear by millions of us , some of us owe our lives to it , but yet we often see it as a cumbersome bureaucratic nightmare which leaks our cash and lags behind sparkling health care systems available elsewhere .
when labour came to power in 1997 , the most obvious sign of years of under-investment was the very fabric of the nhs .
staff were struggling to deliver 20th century medicine in victorian buildings and post-war pre-fabs .
ironically , the solution came in the form of a policy first dreamt up by the conservatives - private finance initiatives .
the idea was simple : private companies would shoulder the burden of building a new hospital , but then the nhs would move in and lease it from them .
if construction companies , banks , cleaning and waste disposal companies got together they could not only build the building but run the logistics as well , all for a set fee .
there were other opportunities to involve the private sector in providing other kinds of care too , such as elderly care beds .
a selection of ppp projects nhs grampian : kincardine community hospital nhs lanarkshire : hairmyres and wishaw hospitals nhs forth valley : new larbert hospital -lrb- 2009 -rrb- nhs dumfries and galloway : daycase and maternity services nhs lothian : edinburgh royal infirmary new labour renamed them public private partnerships , and set about encouraging them with gusto .
but for health boards the reality of commissioning a hospital fit for the next 30 years , which they did not own , was a minefield .
all details of the way the hospital would be used and operated had to be set down and signed off before the nhs could move in .
yet who could predict how a hospital would be used in 2030 ?
medical advances happen all the time - keyhole surgery has dramatically changed how some conditions are treated and reduced the amount of time patients spend in hospital .
but with pfi , any change to the use of a hospital would have to be approved by the private operators , and could incur costly charges . "
pfi is vastly more expensive now than if we 'd gone down the public procurement route " professor allyson pollock edinburgh university there are no rebates if a pfi hospital outlives its usefulness and is left empty .
on wednesday , frontline scotland will reveal more about how some say pfi deals have forced one health board into making decisions that some say run contrary to the best interests of patients .
health authorities also quickly discovered that they had tied themselves into very expensive contracts .
once the hospital was up and running , the companies who built and operated it could look forward to very healthy returns .
the government argues that publicly-funded building projects often run over-budget and also have running costs -lrb- who needs reminding about the scottish parliament ! -rrb- .
but if we take a look at the biggest pfi project so far in the health sector - edinburgh 's royal infirmary - it cost £ 184m to build .
however , lothian health board is committed to repayments of £ 40m every year .
it will have repaid more than £ 1bn by the time the contract ends in 30 years .
in fact , the final bill will be three times the cost of the parliament at holyrood .
let 's return to the question i posed at the very beginning - how do we improve the nhs ?
new labour has turned to the private sector to help it do that .
pfis are just one way in which private companies are taking over aspects of our healthcare .
the argument is that they provide better value for money .
political interference however , professor allyson pollock from edinburgh university 's centre for international public health policy said that under pfi , the nhs would pay up to 10 times more for a hospital than it should have done .
" of course pfi is vastly more expensive now than if we 'd gone down the public procurement route , " she said .
others argue that much of the money that has been wasted in the nhs is directly connected with decades of political interference , and that the core services of the nhs actually already provide excellent value .
even if the nhs is n't as efficient as it could be , the consequence of using private contractors is that taxpayers ' money is spent not only on running a health service , but also on increasing dividends to shareholders . "
you can see the full story on frontline : in sickness and in wealth , on bbc one scotland at 1900 gmt on wednesday , 6 december .

it 's an institution held dear by millions of us , some of us owe our lives to it , but yet we often see it as a cumbersome bureaucratic nightmare which leaks our cash and lags behind sparkling health care systems available elsewhere .
when labour came to power in 1997 , the most obvious sign of years of under-investment was the very fabric of the nhs .
glasgow 's victoria infirmary was opened in 1890 staff were struggling to deliver 20th century medicine in victorian buildings and post-war pre-fabs .
ironically , the solution came in the form of a policy first dreamt up by the conservatives - private finance initiatives .
the idea was simple : private companies would shoulder the burden of building a new hospital , but then the nhs would move in and lease it from them .
if construction companies , banks , cleaning and waste disposal companies got together they could not only build the building but run the logistics as well , all for a set fee .
there were other opportunities to involve the private sector in providing other kinds of care too , such as elderly care beds .
a selection of ppp projects nhs grampian : kincardine community hospital nhs lanarkshire : hairmyres and wishaw hospitals nhs forth valley : new larbert hospital -lrb- 2009 -rrb- nhs dumfries and galloway : daycase and maternity services nhs lothian : edinburgh royal infirmary new labour renamed them public private partnerships , and set about encouraging them with gusto .
but for health boards the reality of commissioning a hospital fit for the next 30 years , which they did not own , was a minefield .
all details of the way the hospital would be used and operated had to be set down and signed off before the nhs could move in .
yet who could predict how a hospital would be used in 2030 ?
medical advances happen all the time - keyhole surgery has dramatically changed how some conditions are treated and reduced the amount of time patients spend in hospital .
but with pfi , any change to the use of a hospital would have to be approved by the private operators , and could incur costly charges .
pfi is vastly more expensive now than if we 'd gone down the public procurement route professor allyson pollock edinburgh university prof pollock 's views there are no rebates if a pfi hospital outlives its usefulness and is left empty .
on wednesday , frontline scotland will reveal more about how some say pfi deals have forced one health board into making decisions that some say run contrary to the best interests of patients .
health authorities also quickly discovered that they had tied themselves into very expensive contracts .
once the hospital was up and running , the companies who built and operated it could look forward to very healthy returns .
the government argues that publicly-funded building projects often run over-budget and also have running costs -lrb- who needs reminding about the scottish parliament ! -rrb- .
but if we take a look at the biggest pfi project so far in the health sector - edinburgh 's royal infirmary - it cost £ 184m to build .
edinburgh royal infirmary will cost £ 1bn by the time the contract ends however , lothian health board is committed to repayments of £ 40m every year .
it will have repaid more than £ 1bn by the time the contract ends in 30 years .
in fact , the final bill will be three times the cost of the parliament at holyrood .
let 's return to the question i posed at the very beginning - how do we improve the nhs ?
new labour has turned to the private sector to help it do that .
pfis are just one way in which private companies are taking over aspects of our healthcare .
the argument is that they provide better value for money .
political interference however , professor allyson pollock from edinburgh university 's centre for international public health policy said that under pfi , the nhs would pay up to 10 times more for a hospital than it should have done .
" of course pfi is vastly more expensive now than if we 'd gone down the public procurement route , " she said .
others argue that much of the money that has been wasted in the nhs is directly connected with decades of political interference , and that the core services of the nhs actually already provide excellent value .
even if the nhs is n't as efficient as it could be , the consequence of using private contractors is that taxpayers ' money is spent not only on running a health service , but also on increasing dividends to shareholders .

it said figures show regional variations in recruitment officers ' visits and has asked the welsh assembly government to ban them from schools .
the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- said army visits were by invitation only and were not to recruit but to raise awareness .
the assembly government said it was up to each school to decide on career opportunities offered .
plaid said it had used the freedom of information act to obtain figures on visits from the army recruitment division for 2005-06 .
the party said the figures showed that schools in the most deprived areas were visited 50 % more often than those in affluent areas and that there were big regional variations . "
the army does not recruit in schools but seeks to raise awareness of the army and its place in a democratic society " ministry of defence schoolchildren in swansea were visited more than 10 times on average during that period while children in the vale of glamorgan had no visits at all .
the mod said the status of the school was " not an issue " and the same opportunities were offered to all .
plaid am leanne wood is writing to welsh education minister jane davidson asking for a ban on army recruitment in schools .
" the army is clearly targeting the most deprived areas in wales , " she said .
" i believe that young people in wales should not be subjected to armed forces propaganda .
" if pupils want to join the army they can visit any number of recruitment centres around wales . "
a mod spokesman said the army visited schools " on specific invitation only " .
he said : " the status of a school is not an issue - the same opportunities are offered to all .
" the army does not recruit in schools , but seeks to raise awareness of the army and its place in a democratic society while building interest in the army and its careers . "
an assembly government spokesperson said it was " up to individual schools to take decisions on career opportunities for their pupils and how those opportunities are offered " .
anna brychan , director of the national association of head teachers -lrb- naht -rrb- cymru , said careers in the armed forces were one of many choices put before children .
she added : " i can understand why these figures might cause concern if it appears that members of the armed forces are disproportionately coming from some backgrounds , especially given the content of the daily news at the moment .
" but ultimately what head teachers are doing is giving pupils the widest possible range of career options backed up by specialist advice from school staff .
" that , i think , is the best way of giving our youngsters the best range of choices possible . "

two-thirds also say that they would emigrate to secure a better future , and one in seven said they would risk their life to reach another country .
the results come from a survey of 3,000 teenagers in 10 cities as part of the bbc 's generation next series .
the young people were quizzed on a range of contemporary political issues .
the key areas of questioning were immigration , climate change , terrorism and war , crime , religion , education , global population and honesty .
the 10 key cities involved in the poll were new york , nairobi , cairo , lagos , rio de janeiro , baghdad , delhi , jakarta , moscow and london - though due to their sensitive nature , not all questions could be asked in all areas .
on the question of immigration , 79 % thought that people should be able to live in whichever country they chose and 64 % said that they would emigrate to secure a better future .
the proportion of respondents that would emigrate to secure a better future was highest in nairobi -lrb- 81 % -rrb- and delhi -lrb- 81 % -rrb- . "
an overwhelming majority said the so-called us war on terror was not making the world a safer place " survey in graphs poll offers contradictions in baghdad , 50 % of the sample said they would not emigrate - the biggest negative response of all 10 cities .

in new york , 61 % thought immigrants should integrate , with only 11 % saying they should keep apart .
in delhi , the figures were just 11 % for integration and 81 % for keeping apart .
when asked which was the most important issue globally right now , 36 % of the respondents listed terrorism .
the issue caused most concern in new delhi -lrb- 66 % -rrb- , new york -lrb- 63 % -rrb- and baghdad -lrb- 59 % -rrb- .

ninety-eight percent of baghdadi respondents said the war on terror was not making the world a safer place .
this negative attitude was echoed in rio de janeiro where 92 % felt the same .

critics , including virgin boss sir richard branson , claimed the purchase was designed to block a proposed takeover of itv by cable firm ntl .
but bskyb boss james murdoch said the deal was based on " long-term value " .
he also said it was " premature " to know what michael grade , who left the bbc to join itv recently , would do in the job .
' strong leadership ' mr grade 's appointment as executive chairman came after itv had been without a chief executive for several months and was suffering falling advertising revenues .
when asked whether mr grade would " fix " itv 's programming and business , mr murdoch told the bbc that it was too early to say what he would do but that he was keen for strong leadership at the top of itv .
sir richard branson , who became ntl 's largest shareholder after its merger with virgin mobile , claimed bskyb 's interest in itv was a " threat to democracy " .
but mr murdoch stressed his firm had long been looking at itv as an investment opportunity .

dina lohan said it was a " positive " step for her daughter , who was scolded by a film studio boss earlier this year for " unprofessional " conduct .
" she 's been attending some meetings and it 's going to be a slow process , " she told people magazine .
lohan , 20 , is best known for roles in children 's movies such as mean girls , the parent trap and freaky friday .

in july , morgan creek productions chief executive james g robinson sent a letter to lohan rebuking her for arriving late on set for the film georgia rule .
" you have acted like a spoiled child , alienated many of your co-workers and endangered the quality of this picture , " he was quoted as saying in the letter .
he is also alleged to have accused the star of blaming her absence on heat exhaustion when he claims it was caused by " all-night heavy partying " .
lohan 's mother said mr robinson was " way out of line " and insisted her daughter 's claims were genuine .
the actress has most recently been seen in bobby , which centres on the assassination of senator robert kennedy in los angeles in june 1968 .

about one in 10 women affected by the disease develop in the cells that line the milk glands , called lobular cancers .
a team from breakthrough breast cancer found high levels of the fgfr1 receptor , the journal clinical cancer research reported .
they said it was the " first step to tailored treatments " for this kind of breast cancer .
treating lobular breast cancers is difficult .
they are generally treated with anti-hormone drugs , like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors , as they have the oestrogen receptor but not all respond well , neither do they respond to chemotherapy before surgery .
poor prognosis the researchers from the breakthrough toby robins breast cancer research centre at the institute of cancer research in london screened the human genome using a new technology called array-cgh -lrb- comparative genomic hybridisation -rrb- to screen the genome for changes .
the discovery of fgfr1 is the first step on the road to tailoring treatment for the 10-15 % of women diagnosed with lobular breast cancer dr jorge reis-filho , breakthrough breast cancer research centre the fgfr1 gene gives instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor .
it has a similar structure to the her2 protein which herceptin is targeted at .
the researchers found that almost half of the breast cancers had levels of the receptor which were too high .
other studies have shown that too much fgfr1 is associated with a poor prognosis and an increased chance of the breast cancer recurring .
the researchers suggest blocking fgfr1 may be a way of treating these breast cancers with abnormally high amounts of fgfr1 .
the also removed the fgfr1 gene from cells that mimicked the genetic features of this group of breast cancers , and showed the cells were " addicted " to the fgfr1 - and so relied on the gene to be present for the tumour to grow .
when fgfr1 was removed , the rate of cell growth was reduced .
new targets the researchers then identified a chemical called su5402 targeted at the receptor which stops fgfr1 working and could therefore reduce the growth of these cells .
it is hoped human trials of this treatment could take place in the next few years .
further research is underway .
it is hoped that , if initial findings are confirmed , drugs which can stop fgfr1 from working could be in clinical trials within two years .
this finding could also be applied to other cancers in which similarly high levels of fgfr1 could be found .
dr jorge reis-filho , team leader of the molecular pathology laboratory at the breakthrough breast cancer research centre , says : " breast cancer is a complex disease made up of many subtypes .
" currently , most breast cancers are treated similarly but we 'd like to be able to tailor treatment for each type .
" to do this , it is important that we find new targets for drug development .
" the discovery of fgfr1 is the first step on the road to tailoring treatment for the 10-15 % of women diagnosed with lobular breast cancer .
" the identification of fgfr1 in this sub-group of breast cancers is a very promising finding and although we are a few years away from clinical trials we are moving closer towards our vision of a future free from the fear of breast cancer . "
dr norman freshney , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said : " although this research is at an early stage , it identifies a promising new target on which to base the development of potential new treatments .
" the application of such treatments , alone or in combination with other treatments , offers future patients better prospects of a full recovery from this disease . "

troops disarmed the police and ministerial bodyguards and set up roadblocks around suva .
military chief cmdr frank bainimarama refused to say if a coup was under way but said the moves were aimed at preventing any outbreak of violence .
he has repeatedly threatened to unseat pm laisenia qarase over plans to grant amnesty to those behind a coup in 2000 .
disarmed truckloads of heavily-armed soldiers were seen leaving the army 's barracks in suva .
they were putting up roadblocks around the capital during the night , and had reportedly cut off several roads into the city .
fiji tensions timeline 2000 brief coup put down by army chief bainimarama 12 july 2005 cmdr bainimarama warns he will topple government if it pardons jailed coup plotters 13 july 2005 pm laisenia qarase says he will review law pardoning plotters 17 may 2006 mr qarase wins re-election 31 oct mr qarase tries - and fails - to replace cmdr bainimarama as army chief 4 november mr qarase says he will change law offering clemency to coup plotters 7 november military calls for police chief to quit 30 november mr qarase offers " concessions " after meeting cmdr bainimarama 30 november cmdr bainimarama warns of coup if demands not met 1 december deadline set for possible coup passes without incident in pictures : coup countdown earlier , troops arrived at the headquarters of the country 's only armed police unit , the tactical response unit , outside suva .
they loaded weapons belonging to police on to army trucks and took them away .
troops also went to a police armoury in the city to remove more weapons .
bodyguards for the prime minister and other ministers were also disarmed .
cmdr bainimarama told reporters his troops had taken weapons off the police " to ensure that police weapons are not used against the military " .
but he insisted the police still had a role to play .
" the police and the -lrb- military -rrb- will work together to ensure the security and safety of all the people of fiji , " he said in a brief statement .
the move was called " unlawful and unnecessary " by acting police commissioner moses driver .
cmdr bainimarama gave no indication whether a coup was under way during his statement to reporters , despite local media reports that he has drawn up a 13-member interim cabinet .
when asked who was running the country , he replied : " i do n't have any comments right now " .
he originally gave the government until last friday to resign or face fiji 's fourth army takeover in two decades .
in a tv interview at the weekend , he said he expected the prime minister to " give in peacefully " and leave office on monday .
prime minister qarase remained defiant on monday , insisting he was still in charge .
he said he had called a special cabinet meeting on tuesday to consider cmdr bainimarama 's " latest and ever-changing demands " .
ongoing feud australia and new zealand have warned of dire economic and social consequences if the military deposes fiji 's elected government .
" it is clear fiji is on the brink of a coup , " australian foreign minister alexander downer told his parliament .
the army chief and pm have been at loggerheads for months new zealand prime minister helen clark warned cmdr bainimarama that sanctions would follow any coup , including a possible travel ban to new zealand where he has family .
the feud between the prime minister and the army chief goes back several months .
it relates to legislation that mr qarase is seeking to pass , which offers a pardon to people involved in the 2000 racially-motivated coup and allocates the ownership of coastal land to ethnic fijians .
cmdr bainimarama played a key role in putting down the uprising and was at one point forced to flee for his life .
he has made it clear that he does not feel the government has done enough to bring its perpetrators to justice .

troops disarmed the police and ministerial bodyguards and set up roadblocks around suva .
military chief cmdr frank bainimarama refused to say if a coup was under way but said the moves were aimed at preventing any outbreak of violence .
he has repeatedly threatened to unseat pm laisenia qarase over plans to grant amnesty to those behind a coup in 2000 .
disarmed truckloads of heavily-armed soldiers were seen leaving the army 's barracks in suva .
they were putting up roadblocks around the capital during the night , and had reportedly cut off several roads into the city .

they loaded weapons belonging to police on to army trucks and took them away .
troops also went to a police armoury in the city to remove more weapons .
bodyguards for the prime minister and other ministers were also disarmed .
cmdr bainimarama told reporters his troops had taken weapons off the police " to ensure that police weapons are not used against the military " .
but he insisted the police still had a role to play .
" the police and the -lrb- military -rrb- will work together to ensure the security and safety of all the people of fiji , " he said in a brief statement .
the move was called " unlawful and unnecessary " by acting police commissioner moses driver .
cmdr bainimarama gave no indication whether a coup was under way during his statement to reporters , despite local media reports that he has drawn up a 13-member interim cabinet .
when asked who was running the country , he replied : " i do n't have any comments right now " .
he originally gave the government until last friday to resign or face fiji 's fourth army takeover in two decades .

it relates to legislation that mr qarase is seeking to pass , which offers a pardon to people involved in the 2000 racially-motivated coup and allocates the ownership of coastal land to ethnic fijians .
cmdr bainimarama played a key role in putting down the uprising and was at one point forced to flee for his life .
he has made it clear that he does not feel the government has done enough to bring its perpetrators to justice .

annual spending on plant and equipment rose 12 % between july and september , compared to the previous quarter 's 16.6 % growth , official data showed .
economists fear the numbers could bring down revised third quarter economic growth data , to be released on friday .
initial figures showed japan 's economy recovering after years of contraction , expanding 2 % over the period .
' solid trend ' despite the fall in factory spending , analysts were keen to point out that the figure still marked an annual rise for the world 's second largest economy .
" corporate capital spending , even if it may see some moderation in the growth pace , will maintain its solid trend going forward , " said yasuo yamamoto , an economist with mizuho research institute .
preliminary gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- figures issued in november were above expectations , showing japan 's economy expanding 2 % on a yearly basis .
with signs that japan 's economy is expanding strongly after many years of stuttering growth , some economists expect an interest rate rise in the not too distant future .
but the government is keen not to raise rates too fast , which could hamper growth .
the bank of japan raised its interest rates to 0.25 % in july , bringing to an end its five-year policy of keeping base rates at zero .
the factory spending figures are based on the actions of 25,000 large firms .

the authority wants public comments on four options to save the sea defences between rhos-on-sea and old colwyn .
one businessman said he wanted the council to use the opportunity to create a marina as a combination of sea-defence and job creation .
an exhibition was held on sunday , but emailed comments are still invited .
according to the council the sea wall is in poor condition and at risk of being undermined by falling beach levels .
" in some places beach levels have dropped by up to three metres in the last 50 years , " said a spokesperson .
" this causes problems such as occurred at old colwyn recently , where emergency repairs cost in the region of £ 100,000 and closed the promenade for three weeks .
" if allowed to deteriorate further , the promenade road , coastal properties and eventually the railway are at risk of being lost to the sea . "
the council is looking at four options .
the cheapest is to place rocks at the toe of the existing wall , while the most expensive is to reconstruct the sea wall .
neil formstone , who runs three businesses near the seaside , said water sports were vital to the colwyn bay area .
" i want the council to use this opportunity for expansion in the town , to turn it around and create a marina , " said mr formstone .
" people should not jump in and think ' let 's stop the sea ' - we should be asking what advantages can we get from it , even if it means to have to wait 12 months to get the right plan . "
