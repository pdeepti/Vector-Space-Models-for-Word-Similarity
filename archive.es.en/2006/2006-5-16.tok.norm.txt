a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .

in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .

good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .

teddy bears are so 20th century .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .
especially the number of unreported cases must be much higher than in previous years , union officials said , blaming cutbacks in manpower and equipment . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees strong rise in politically-motivated crime the number of criminal offenses from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is growing in germany .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action .

1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

it 's raining knickers in hamburg what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .

" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2006 eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to come to slovenia , but not lithuania the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania . the eu executive 's recommendation opens the way for slovenia to become the first former communist country to join the currently 12-nation currency club on jan.1 , 2007 . eu member states and the european parliament also have to approve of slovenia joining the euro zone next year for the ex-yugoslav republic 's euro debut to go ahead next year . but the commission told lithuania , which also wanted to join the eurozone next year , that the baltic country 's inflation was not in line with a euro zone limit of 2 percent .
lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them . " these are truly stasi methods like in east germany where colleagues spied on colleagues and friends on friends , " barth said .
" i believe an apology by the bnd is not enough here .
it must clearly have personnel and political consequences .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .

aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd .

the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them . " these are truly stasi methods like in east germany where colleagues spied on colleagues and friends on friends , " barth said .
" i believe an apology by the bnd is not enough here .
it must clearly have personnel and political consequences .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .
especially the number of unreported cases must be much higher than in previous years , union officials said , blaming cutbacks in manpower and equipment . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees strong rise in politically-motivated crime the number of criminal offenses from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is growing in germany .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

" these amendments will permit the rich documentation preserved at headquarters of the its -lrb- international tracing service -rrb- in bad arolsen to be opened to researchers and historians , " the countries ' representatives said in a statement after a meeting in luxembourg . the world 's largest archive of its kind based in the central german town of bad arolsen covers the fates of 17.5 million forced laborers and concentration camp inmates and has until now been open only to them and their relatives . this fact had led us academics to accuse germany of trying to cover up its past . but in april , german justice minister brigitte zypries said berlin was now prepared to give the go-ahead for broader access to the 47 million often macabre documents . the decision required the approval of all 11 countries that have held control of the files in the post-war period . germa n y relucta n t at first germany in particular had been reluctant to give researchers access to the archives , which offer a chilling , detailed account of nazi wartime atrocities for fear that it would compromise the victims ' privacy . at the meeting , representatives said that provisions would be taken to ensure the dignity of individuals covered in the files .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .

perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball .

while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .

while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .

" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2006 eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu membership is within reach for romania and bulgaria eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 . speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg , barroso said that both countries could become eu members if they managed to resolve remaining problems , especially in the areas of justice and domestic policies . barroso said he and eu enlargement commissioner would travel to sofia and bucharest to deliver a " message of encouragement . " should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : offsides from the fringe germany 's mascots play the shame game could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? world cup host city residents told to behave beate uhse loses its world cup buzz news -pipe- 16.05.2006 when baring it all is not enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dude , where are your pants ?
a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2006 eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to come to slovenia , but not lithuania the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania . the eu executive 's recommendation opens the way for slovenia to become the first former communist country to join the currently 12-nation currency club on jan.1 , 2007 . eu member states and the european parliament also have to approve of slovenia joining the euro zone next year for the ex-yugoslav republic 's euro debut to go ahead next year . but the commission told lithuania , which also wanted to join the eurozone next year , that the baltic country 's inflation was not in line with a euro zone limit of 2 percent .
lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2006 eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu membership is within reach for romania and bulgaria eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 . speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg , barroso said that both countries could become eu members if they managed to resolve remaining problems , especially in the areas of justice and domestic policies . barroso said he and eu enlargement commissioner would travel to sofia and bucharest to deliver a " message of encouragement . " should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .

teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study .

in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .

in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them . " these are truly stasi methods like in east germany where colleagues spied on colleagues and friends on friends , " barth said .
" i believe an apology by the bnd is not enough here .
it must clearly have personnel and political consequences .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .

while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them .

" what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them . " these are truly stasi methods like in east germany where colleagues spied on colleagues and friends on friends , " barth said .
" i believe an apology by the bnd is not enough here .
it must clearly have personnel and political consequences .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .
especially the number of unreported cases must be much higher than in previous years , union officials said , blaming cutbacks in manpower and equipment . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees strong rise in politically-motivated crime the number of criminal offenses from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is growing in germany .

police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .

they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .

while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .
" the technology can develop dramatically , so it 's difficult to predict what is going to happen .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?
-lrb- feb .
9 , 2006 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-worlds series " from the fringe " hallelujah !
it 's raining knickers in hamburg what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity .
-lrb- march 20 , 2006 -rrb- feedback is goleo not wearing pants for a reason ?

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 .

the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .

german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .
human scouting can start this june in bremen . even without shin pads , a bruise would be more likely than a broken leg if " robotinho " were to slide tackle a person .
in fact , the move would probably do more damage to the lightweight metal frame and electronics that fill the five-kilo , 60-cm -lrb- 11-pound , 23-inch -rrb- robot than the opposing player - if it was capable of sliding . " moving forward on two legs is not so reliable , " said sven behnke of some of the humanoid robots he has created at the albert-ludwigs university in freiburg , home to " robotinho " as well as " sepp " and " jupp , " two other robots that won an april robocup event in holland .
" they often end up pushing each other over when they get close to each other and fight for the ball . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sepp " and " jupp " are among the 2006 robocup favorites how far behnke and his team have come with their robots will be put to the test next month in bremen , where robots on some 350 teams from 40 countries play in four size-based leagues and one computer-based simulation league at the 10th robot world cup , an international initiative designed to research and development of robotics and artificial intelligence . no remote co n trols allowed just like the players on soccer 's more traditional pitches , the robots make their own decisions when it comes to shooting or passing .
while a human defender 's umpteenth clearance into the upper-deck may look robotic to fans hoping for a goal , getting robots to decide they need more time to defend is just one of the problems facing programmers . each robot has to recognize objects on the field , know where it is in relation to other players , dribble the ball and follow a set of simplified , fifa-based rules independent of outside influence . ideally , they should also show some team spirit by cooperating with each other . " everything humans can do naturally has to be programmed in the robots , " mainz university 's peter dauscher said of the machines , which can cost upwards of 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,851 -rrb- .
" they need to be able to analyze the situation and decide what they should do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much competition for humans at the moment robocup organizers - the sport has two international robot soccer federations , similar to world soccer governing body fifa , as well as numerous national clubs - have set an ambitious goal of fielding a team capable of beating a human world cup team by 2050 . " it 's a very ambitious goal , " dauscher said .
" right now the robots have a hard time playing against three-year-olds . " co n fere n ces drive scie n tific developme n t to help speed up development , the competitions are accompanied by scientific conferences where researchers are able to share information and detail how their droids process the thousands of decisions involved in a soccer game . a detailed set of rules exists to help the robots play autonomously .
the white sidelines and the orange ball look familiar , but different colored goals - one blue and one yellow - are intended purely to help the robots calculate where they are on the field . " what is taking place in the humanoid league does not really have very much in common with a soccer game , " said dauscher , describing robot soccer 's lack of end-to-end action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect him to celebrate , researchers are pleased when he does n't fall over despite the slower pace and fewer players on the field , two-on-two matches started in the humanoid league last year , and fans are still willing to watch robots battle to become robocup champions . there were 180,000 at the 2005 osaka robocup , and hubert borgmann of messe bremen , one of the 2006 robocup organizers , said he expects about 30,000 visitors in addition to the 2,500 researchers at the june 14 to june 18 event in the northern german city .
he said the attendance difference is due to a greater acceptance of robots in japan . probi n g o n a level playi n g field , literally the soccer and robotics fans who do attend should n't expect to see robots dancing in celebration with the corner flag after scoring a goal - that 's far from the researchers ' main goal .
instead the competition is used to put the robots in a standardized situation , which keeps different research groups from using different criteria to measure their performance while testing the robot 's ability to perceive its surroundings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the pitch , tomorrow the living room ?
" the soccer tournament is a good test area for many aspects of what is being developed , " dauscher said , adding that advanced mechanics , photo recognition and artificial intelligence are among the many skills researchers are still trying to teach robots .
" in the game the robots see the ball , their opponents and the goalposts , in a daily situation it could be the cat , a chair and the oven . " the scientists admit their research is n't far enough along that robots are going to start taking over household duties or the soccer field soon , however , they also agreed robotics and artificial intelligence continues to develop quickly , making it extremely difficult to predict how the robots could be used in the future . " computers 50 years ago were dinosaurs compared to today 's pocket computers and mobile phones , " behnke said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .

in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .
especially the number of unreported cases must be much higher than in previous years , union officials said , blaming cutbacks in manpower and equipment . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees strong rise in politically-motivated crime the number of criminal offenses from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is growing in germany .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .

" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?
he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german schools trail significantly in immigrant education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of immigrants receive little support in german schools a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state . the results of the latest study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , which were published on monday , show that germany is by far and large failing to help children of immigrant families integrate into society through education . the study " where immigrant children succeed " drew evidence from the 2003 tests conducted with 15-year-old students in 41 countries , which covered mathematics , reading comprehension , science and problem-solving skills .
it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .
language programs , starting with kindergarten , are expected to perform an important role in the new government strategy . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ?

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

a new scandal is rocking the fifa world cup .
goleo vi , the official championship mascot , is turning out to be a flop .
perhaps he will have to become a male stripper after all . german toy maker nici said on monday it was facing financial ruin because of the disappointing sales of the official world cup mascot , goleo vi . somebody should have seen it coming .
we live in a superficial age , in which joan collins and linda evans , who recently got together for a dynasty reunion , look exactly the same as they did 20 years ago at the peak of the international shoulder-pad mania .
good looks are important .
good looks will get you anywhere . goleo , on the other hand , is not exactly what you 'd call an attractive fellow .
he could easily pass for an out-of-wedlock child of mumbling star wars monster chewbacca and us 1980s sitcom teddy-bear starlet alf .
and now , it turns out , nobody wants to hold him , hug him , and call him george . the fine gentlemen of fifa probably could n't care less .
for all their declared love of sport and international understanding - which sometimes makes them sound as if they were running a charity founded by mother theresa and not an international money-making machine with a surplus of 138 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- in 2005 alone - fifa officials were clever enough to diversify into the obsessive-compulsive world of computer games .
teddy bears are so 20th century .
but the german company that licensed the european rights to goleo filed for bankruptcy on tuesday . naked fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nudism has by now become an integral part of german culture goleo vi will go down in history as a failed attempt at creating a market for teddy-bear erotica .
why would he otherwise be wearing a t-shirt but stay stark naked down below ? admittedly , germany is known - especially to those who grew up with the puritan tradition of anglo-saxon emotional dysfunction which treats the naked body as a proven source of evil - as a weird place where hippies prance around naked in parks and on tv .
maybe goleo was simply trying to spread the liberating , nudist message : kick back , get naked and relax ! according to the official goleo biography on the fifa web site , goleo was cast from a talented group of wannabe-superstars - ranging from a giant berlin currywurst sausage to a mammoth bavarian pretzel .
it should have been obvious form the start , however , that mr. no-pants was a troubled individual . childhood traumas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo is terrified of nets and fishnets - even as a fashion statement according to fifa , goleo was born in botswana in 1985 .
he experienced serious trauma as a child when he was discovered by poachers who caught him with a net .
he was freed later on but , to this day , he is petrified by all sorts of nets and - above all - fishnet stockings . fishnet stockings ?
hello , fifa !
anybody home ?
everybody knows that the oldest trade in the world is legal in germany and that sex worker ladies often expose their skyscraper legs only dimly veiled by fishnets .
goleo would only need to take a walk down oranienburger strasse in berlin late at night and he 'd have a nervous breakdown .
exposing him to his worst nightmares is simply mean . and what exactly can goleo do other than constantly kick his talking ball sidekick pille in the face ? " anything you need him to , " says the fifa web site .
" -lrb- he can -rrb- play the drums , draw figures without trousers , laze around and relax .
if he 's in a really good mood , goleo vi also likes to sing , much to pille 's disgust , as he finds the racket truly appalling . " now one should n't be too nitpicky , but goleo really sounds like a weird combination of a male whore -lrb- he 'll do anything you want him to -rrb- , a cartoon pornographer -lrb- he draws figures without trousers -rrb- and sidekick-molester -lrb- he makes his best friend feel disgusted -rrb- .
admittedly goleo 's sidekick is a scary creature in his own right , but how much abuse does a talking ball have to take these days - even from a best friend ? there are still kind people in this world who realized that the last thing goleo needed was to become a superstar à la robbie williams .
so they decided not to spend money on him .
he really has two options now : rehab or professional striptease .
hopefully he will make the right decision . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2006 german mps vote to release secret report in spying scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents spy on journalists ?
a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .

a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks . norbert röttgen , chairman of the parliamentary oversight committee that commissioned the report confirmed on tuesday that it would be published .
a final decision is expected to be taken in the coming week . a few details of the report , which were published by several german newspapers last week , have whipped up a political storm in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the postwar period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel at the 50th anniversary of the bnd last week on monday , the german government weighed in , calling on the bnd to stop spying on journalists or use them as sources .
under german law , the bnd has no mandate to operate on german soil unless it is protecting its own work . according to the secret report , the bnd spied on far more journalists than previously known as well as hired some as informants in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press .
the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . new allegatio n s of pho n e tappi n g on tuesday , the widening scandal took a new twist after the berli n er zeitu n g newspaper reported that the bnd had also tapped the telephones of journalists to find out their sources .
the paper however said that no blanket bugging of media offices had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd is believed to have spied on journalists for years the hamburg-based news magazine ster n reported in its edition due out on thursday that a bugging device had been found in the apartment of one of its journalists , peter schütz , who often covered arms deals and bnd activities .
the magazine said that although the complete bugging mechanism could not be found , experts concluded it " bore all the hallmarks of the secret services . " the bnd however has vehemently denied allegations that it tapped journalists ' phones . " a bugging operation can definitely be ruled out , " former bnd head august hanning said .
" the bnd has never tapped telephones . " röttgen of the parliamentary oversight committee has said that " the way things stand now " there 's nothing to indicate that the bnd tapped telephones of journalists . bnd already bei n g probed for role i n iraq though many details of the affair still remain sketchy , there are increasing calls for a full investigation of the affair by politicians and media representatives . " if the bnd president was aware of the activities or even approved of them , he must draw personnel consequences .
at the moment however it 's still too early to call on anyone to resign , " said hans-peter uhl of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of the parliamentary oversight committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of two bnd agents in iraq is already under scrutiny some members of parliament have threatened to widen an ongoing probe into the bnd 's activities abroad .
the federal intelligence service is already subject to an inquiry over the role two of its agents played in helping the us in the invasion of iraq . media co n siders legal steps on tuesday , both news magazines ster n and der spiegel were said to be considering taking legal steps against the bnd . the federal intelligence service is also said to have acquired private photographs of the editor-in-chief of der spiegel , stefan aust .
aust said he had been hitherto unaware of the photographs showing him at his riding stables , which were kept in the files of the bnd . " what has been done here is quite something , " aust told tuesday 's hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper , saying it was illegal that journalists were being spied upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are said to have been spied on by the bnd the fact that much of the spying appears to have been carried out by journalists against their colleagues has led some commentators to compare the practice to the activities of the infamous east german secret police , the stasi . journalist karl-günther barth , editor-in-chief of the daily hamburger abe n dblatt , one of the alleged victims of the practice , is one of them . " these are truly stasi methods like in east germany where colleagues spied on colleagues and friends on friends , " barth said .
" i believe an apology by the bnd is not enough here .
it must clearly have personnel and political consequences .

" should either country fail to meet the requirements , membership could be postponed by a year . a final decision on the matter wo n't be taken until october , however , giving both countries a chance for last minute fixes . diplomats said that the declining pace of reform in the two countries was the reason for the delay in giving the final go-ahead to sofia and bucharest .
by increasing the pressure on bulgaria and romania , eu leaders , including commission chief jose manuel barroso , hope that a postponement of membership to 2008 wo n't be necessary . " no later than early october we will review the situation on those outstanding issues , " barroso said , adding that " the possibility of being ready in 2007 is doable . " the ca n didates face three possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief barroso would like membership " as soon as possible " a no-string attached invitation , however , is only one of three possibilities that bulgaria and romania could face in rehn 's report .
if he finds that all the criteria have been met then some 30 million bulgarians and romanians can prepare to celebrate their acceptance into the eu club on jan .
1 . another possibility which they may have to accept is a postponement of membership until 2008 .
based on the findings of the last report rehn presented last october , serious problems had to be addressed .
in the october report , corruption was high on the list , and the commission said it had to be tackled with " urgent and forceful action . " " if it remains at current levels , corruption threatens the internal market , the proper functioning of eu policies and eu-funded programs , " the commission said in its october monitoring report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering continues to be a problem in the candidate countries progress in the fight against organized crime , fraud and money-laundering also belonged to the conditions set by the eu .
bulgaria must also clean up the improper use of eu agricultural funds and address veterinary issues . a third possibility would be an invitation to join in january 2007 but the two countries would not be able to take part in certain activities - for example at the judicial level if eu concerns about corruption have not been allayed - until all the requirements have been met . eu leaders have fi n al say eu leaders must give the final stamp of approval for bulgaria 's and romania 's ascendancy on jan .
1 , 2007 .
it would take a unanimous vote to postpone bulgaria 's membership until 2008 .
for romania , a two-thirds majority would suffice .
the disparity lies in the fact that bulgaria had long proved it was battling corruption more successfully than romania . in the meantime , bucharest has overtaken sofia in the fight against graft , but that will not change the voting procedure when it occurs . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

it focused , however , on 17 countries with large immigrant populations , including australia , canada , france , germany , russia , hong kong and the us . according to barbara ischinger , director for education at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the difference in school performance between immigrant children and native german students was more pronounced in germany than in almost any other country covered by the study . " something needs to be done about this urgently , " ischinger said . from bad to worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of immigrant students is failing in germany while in some countries , second-generation immigrant children stayed on the same level of their first-generation counterparts , or , in some cases , recognizably improved their performance , germany and , to a much lesser extent , denmark and the flemish part of belgium , were an exception in this respect . on average , 15-year-olds with an immigrant background trailed behind their native counterparts by 48 score points , an educational deficit worth about one whole year of study .
in germany , the gap between second-generation immigrant children and native students was twice as big : 90 score points . forty-seven percent of immigrant children born in germany failed to achieve the minimum proficiency in mathematics , whereas in the case of first-generation immigrant children , who spent one part of their schooling in their country of origin , the deficiency in the knowledge of mathematics was shown by only 25 percent of students . not their fault the report spotlights the enormous challenge facing the german educational system as it grapples with the problem of integrating immigration children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant children show more interest in school than their german counterparts , the study said the mere fact that germany has a large immigrant population can not adequately account for the fact that immigrant children underperform in german schools .
traditional immigrant societies like canada , australia and new zealand , for example , show significantly better results than germany .
second-generation 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in canada , for example , have scored 111 points more on average than their counterparts in germany .
that amounts to almost three years of study . language and the geographical origin of immigrant children may present additional factors , according to the report .
but this is not sufficient to explain variations in performance between the countries .
for example , immigrant students whose families come from turkey tend to perform poorly in many countries , but they do significantly worse in germany -lrb- 405 score points -rrb- than they do in switzerland -lrb- 436 score points -rrb- . the performance of immigrant children in germany ca n't be blamed on their lack of interest in school , either . on the pisa index of interest in and enjoyment of mathematics , for example , german immigrant students score significantly higher than native students .
this also holds for the pisa index of instrumental motivation . missing language skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister of education annette schavan in the countries which have well-established and well-structured language support programs for immigrant children , especially in early childhood , the performance of second-generation immigrant children tends to be much closer , if not equal , to that of native children .
in canada and australia , for example , immigrant children perform as well as native canadians and australians . in germany , the gap between native and immigrant children is particularly pronounced in those cases in which immigrant families do not speak german . additionally , the problem lies in german primary schools , which are ill-equipped to deal with socio-economic and cultural problems facing immigrant children .
immigrant children tend to be directed to schools with lower performance expectations and dominated by disadvantaged student population . according to german education minister annette schavan , german schools addressed the problem of integration " too late . "
schavan announced that a general integration strategy was currently under development by the german government .
german chancellor angela merkel is planning to host a summit dedicated to the topic at the end of june .

that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree . the overall number of crimes in germany has dropped slightly and the police have been able to improve their rate of success in solving cases , making germany one of the safest countries in the world , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said at the presentation of this country 's latest criminal statistics . a representative of the german police union , however , attributes the decrease in figures to other factors , including a rise in the number of cases not reported to police . but judging solely by the official figures on crimes committed in germany , schäuble said that 2005 could again be described as a successful year for police here . apart from 2004 , when there was a slight increase in the number of cases , 2005 saw the fourth drop in the crime rate in the past 5 years .
according to statistics 6.39 million cases were reported in 2005 - more than 240,000 or 3.6 percent less than in the previous year .
german police was also able to improve their clear-up rate from 54.2 percent to 55 , which testified to rising police efficiency , the interior minister said . crime fighti n g i n germa n y very efficie n t , says mi n ister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-crime initiatives are keeping levels down , ministers say " this shows that crime fighting in this country is very efficient and that police are doing an excellent job , " schäuble said .
" this has also become possible because the german police are highly respected and trusted as public opinion polls have shown .
they have made germany one of the safest places in the world . " according to the 2005 statistics , capital crimes such as murder and manslaughter again dropped markedly by 3.4 percent , with a clear-up rate reaching almost 100 percent .
officials attributed this primarily to improved dna-testing made available to police in recent years .
there were also drops in cases of theft , break-ins , robbery and drug-related offenses . schäuble was relieved to announce that a rise in juvenile delinquency cases recorded in 2004 had been stopped .
the number of foreigners involved in crime also showed a greater drop than other sectors of the population . card fraud a n d i n ter n et crime o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plastic fraud is on the increase on the rise was credit card and internet-related fraud , reflecting the increased use of the net for purchasing goods .
cases of assault and severe bodily harm also rose by about 5 percent . " this increase is due to greater awareness and subsequently more cases being reported for example at schools , " said günther beckstein , the interior minister of bavaria .
" but it is first and foremost an indication that society as a whole shows a greater willingness to use violence .
campaigns to curb violence have n't achieved much which should be reason for concern to all of us . " germany 's police union , however , has criticized the report as being substantially flawed .
especially the number of unreported cases must be much higher than in previous years , union officials said , blaming cutbacks in manpower and equipment . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees strong rise in politically-motivated crime the number of criminal offenses from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum is growing in germany .

lithuania has been frustrated with the european commission and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- - which sets euro zone monetary policy - for insisting that the baltic state bring down inflation running at an annual average of 2.6 percent . slower process tha n expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the road to the euro looks increasingly potholed in may 2004 , economists and political leaders held broadly that the new eu members would become part of the euro zone by 2010 , with the first wave of three to four countries by 2007 .
that view has since changed . while slovenia seems ready to adopt the common currency , for the other hopefuls , the date for joining the current 12-nation euro zone continues to be pushed back . the governor of the hungarian central bank -lrb- hnb -rrb- , zsigmond jarai , said last week that hungary might be ready to adopt the euro in 2013 . " if we 're lucky , " he added . except for poland , the new eu members , mostly ex-communist states of north and east europe , want to join the euro zone as soon as possible as indicated when they signed the eu accession treaty . however qualification to join the euro zone depends on applicants satisfying a range of measures and notably five criteria for economic convergence .
the criteria set targets for inflation , interest rates , the exchange rate , the public deficit and debt . major stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital , budapest those are major barriers blocking the euro roadway .
in hungary , previous governments avoided tackling the spiraling public deficit which would have called for unpopular measures to cut state spending . last year , hungary 's deficit was equal to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while the eu has set a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp .
hungary 's leadership has decided to apply tough remedies .
last week , socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany announced major overhauls of the public and health sectors , including massive job cuts among the 100,000-strong civil service , to try to qualify for the euro zone by 2010 . differe n t set of sta n dards for euro hopefuls ? another paradox is that the euro hopefuls are being held to the letter of the common currency criteria , while certain members already in the euro zone , such as france and germany , have missed some marks , such as the deficit ceiling , for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro hopefuls are n't very enamored of the common currency up against that strict attitude , estonia has pushed back its euro target date by one year to january 2008 even though it was one of the rare european states for the past five year to post a budget surplus : 1.6 percent of gdp in 2005 . estonia , like lithuania , faces a hurdle of inflation , a product of economic growth exceeding 10 percent per year . strong economic growth can be expected to cause appreciation of a country 's currency .
but owing to concerns about stability , the baltic states have chosen to shadow the euro .
the only possible adjustment is to slow down inflation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche mark lives on it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .

the front page boldly declares " no news today " but below says " just 6,500 africans died today as a result of a preventable , treatable disease " .
the campaign involves brands such as american express , gap and motorola , which have pledged to donate part of their profits to the health crisis plaguing africa .
the paper says half its revenue from the day will go towards the campaign .
' voice of africa ' bono has interviewed tony blair and gordon brown on their " shared vision for africa " in the independent .
both politicians agree the " voice of africa " needs to be heard at international meetings on trade deals .
in the one-off edition bono also attempts to inject his own style of humour , perhaps self-indulgently , by chatting to comedian eddie izzard .
u2 guitarist the edge also gives an interview on how musicians of new orleans are rebuilding their culture .
meanwhile on the sport pages bono shows an interest in the turf and tips several horses from the emerald isle , including aidan o 'brien-trained septimus for next month 's derby at epsom .
drought warning water shortages across the uk have dominated tuesday 's headlines .
most papers warn that millions of people could face queues for water at stand pipes and supply rationing .
the daily telegraph says the drought has the potential to be the worst in 30 years .
the daily express adds a burst main flooded part of west london on the same day the environmental agency issued advice on water restrictions .
sat-nav misdirects ambulance the story of how an ambulance took almost two hours to get an injured girl to hospital , after satellite navigation misdirected it , features in two papers .
chloe banks , 10 , waited almost an hour after she was hit by a car in the village of greenside , near gateshead .
once the emergency crew arrived the sat-nav sent the ambulance back along country lanes instead of the main road , taking another 40 minutes , the daily mail reported .
the times said their reporter completed the same journey in just 22 minutes .

phan van khai said it was time to make way for a younger generation to lead the country , and nominated deputy pm nguyen tan dung , 56 , as his successor .
he was the first vietnamese prime minister to visit the us since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 .
the appointment is expected to be confirmed at the national assembly meeting which began on tuesday .
" i have asked to retire ... we should let the younger generation lead , " mr khai , who is 72 , told reporters before the opening of the national assembly , the six-week long meeting of the country 's parliament .
the bbc 's bill hayton in hanoi says nguyen tan dung is seen as an economic liberal .
in his opening address to the assembly , mr dung acknowledged the country 's impressive economic growth but also spoke of the country 's difficulties , such as inequality .
the national assembly is also likely to approve other changes to several top leadership positions , including the announcement of a new foreign minister and president .
mr khai had let it be known that he intended to give up his post at last month 's congress of vietnam 's ruling communist party .
the congress responded by dropping him from the party 's leading body , the politburo .
corruption focus apart from the cabinet reshuffle , the national assembly may come under pressure to tackle several multi-million dollar corruption scandals which have rocked the communist party .
in particular , it is expected to report on what has become known as the " pmu 18 " affair , in which some party members are accused of misusing millions of dollars of public funds on european football matches .
general-secretary nong duc manh described the accusations as a major threat to the ruling party 's existence .
mr manh told the national assembly the country needed to " accelerate the concerted fight against corruption , wastefulness and bureaucracy ... this is the fight against one of the major dangers that do harm to our regime . "
mr dung promised to do more to tackle corruption by improving the transparency of government and pledging to compensate people who suffer because of illegal decisions taken by officials .

screen sirens on the beach , hollywood 's leading men on the croisette and thousands of wannabe martin scorseses hawking their films across town - it can only be cannes .
for 10 days , anyone who is anyone in the film business , as well as thousands of no-ones-quite-yet , descend on the french resort for the annual film showcase .
blockbuster-in-waiting the da vinci code opens the festival on wednesday but after the film 's stars tom hanks and audrey tatou have departed the red carpet , the rest of the festival 's visitors get down to the brass tacks of film promotion and sales .
" cannes is important because it is the most important film festival and most important film market at the same time , " says john woodward , the chief executive of the uk 's film promotion body , the film council .
" for 10 days everyone involved in film production in the world is in the same place . "
charles mcdonald , of pr giants mcdonald and rutter , will be in cannes for the 21st time , helping to promote some of the biggest names in the competition , including pedro almodovar 's volver and richard kelly 's southland tales .
" much as i love berlin and venice , cannes in the key festival because it combines a massive market as well as the festival , " he says .
" cannes maintains a balance between high-profile american films and the art house . "
' fresh talent ' the british film industry is celebrating two entrants in the official competition for the palme d 'or and uk involvement in two other films shown in competition at cannes .
ken loach 's the wind that shakes the barley and andrea arnold 's red road are both in competition for the palme d 'or .
" it 's incredibly important that two british films are in the competition .
their appearance is symbolic of the health of a particular section of british film production , " says mr woodward .
neither film has blockbuster success written all over them - both are slices of social history , with loach 's film examining the struggle by workers in ireland in the 1920s to achieve independence from britain while arnold , who won a short film oscar in 2005 , looks at contemporary life in glasgow .
" andrea arnold is a very interesting , fresh young talent , " says mr mcdonald , whose company is representing both loach and arnold at the festival .
" the important thing is not to get too excited about the fact there are two films in competition so that in years when we get nothing at all we do n't slit our wrists , " he adds .
in years past when britain had not a single representation at cannes the death of the british film industry was signalled .
but mr woodward says : " when you have two films in competition at cannes it says something very powerful about the strength of british film-making .
" there are about 100 british movies in the market this year being bought and sold internationally .
" it 's a good time to step back - especially after the hiatus over tax uncertainty - and take stock of what is a healthy picture .
" it is healthy culturally but also the number of films in the market shows a sign of confidence also . "
growing impact the uk also has involvement in a third film in competition , richard linklater 's fast food nation .
the film council gave script development money to the project and the us film is co-produced by bbc films , which also made red road .
" this is the first time we 've had two films in the main competition at cannes and we 're obviously delighted , " said david m thompson , head of bbc films .
" this is a testament to our films ' continued impact on the international stage . "
with cannes heavyweights such as almodovar and nanni morretti in the running for the palme d 'or the british talent is in great company .
film-makers such as richard linklater , richard kelly and sofia coppola have also received the recognition of cannes this year .
and with a jury which mixes art house luminaries such as hong kong director wong kar-wai with us and british actors such as samuel l jackson and helena bonham carter perhaps a new talent will receive the ultimate palme d 'or accolade this year .

on bbc wales ' week in week out , road safety minister stephen ladyman admits the government has failed to change the attitude of many young drivers .
but he said judges could help by handing out tougher sentences .
on average each week one 17-25-year-old is killed in a road crash , and another seven are seriously injured .
mr ladyman told bbc wales : " i do believe that they -lsb- judges -rsb- are too lenient at times .
" but i do believe , especially with the new powers in the road safety bill , that they have the range of severe sentences available to them that they can use if they think its appropriate - and they should use them more often . "
police have also admitted that they are dealing with a growing problem with drivers in the 17 to 25-year-old age group .
the case of kieran knight highlights the particular problem .
witnesses said knight was impatient to pull out of the junction on monday , the 20-year-old was given four years ' detention for killing geraint flynn , 19 , in swansea last year .
the teenager was fatally injured as he crossed the road in front of knight 's car in swansea .
knight was waiting to pull out of a junction on the evening of the england-wales rugby international last february .
the streets were busy with revellers following the match and knight seemed impatient to pull out , witnesses at the trial said .
a judge described his driving as " reckless " and " extremely dangerous " .
he hit mr flynn before driving over his head and body .
geraint flynn 's parents geoff and sally call for more traffic controls geraint 's mother sally flynn said : " our 19-year-old son was making the transition from a boy to man , he was so beautiful , has been killed by a dangerous driver who is going to spend not long enough in prison . "

the scottish executive said it was making cash available to buy 1,000 hand-held " wand " metal detectors to frisk youngsters for knives .
the wands will be used to check people in the streets or at pubs and clubs , especially in the west of scotland .
the move comes in the run-up to a national knife amnesty , which begins on 24 may and lasts for one month .
hand-held wands have already been used to a limited extent in the strathclyde force area .
justice minister cathy jamieson said : " i have decided that we want to see more use of these .
" we have therefore decided to put more money , about £ 100,000 , into ensuring that we can get 1,000 of these hand-held metal detectors for police to use when they are out and about in the kind of areas where knives are a problem . "
the detectors are expected to come into use in the summer .

more than four out of five police officers on the beat wants to see greater numbers of firearms officers .
a higher proportion want to see stun guns used more widely but support for becoming armed themselves remains low .

extrapolating from these statistics to police forces as a whole , the federation said around 7,000 police officers had been threatened with a gun in the last two years .
the figures also show 40,000 have faced a knife and 50,000 have contended with threats related to another type of weapon .
the federation , which represents frontline police officers , commissioned researchers to poll its 141,000 members , of whom 47,000 replied .

it comes after a report revealed 25 % of reservists who had fought in iraq experienced a mental health disorder , compared with 19 % of regular soldiers .
researchers at kings college in london said territorial army -lrb- ta -rrb- members had less support than the other soldiers .
but they added that overall , veterans suffered lower levels of illness than their 1991 gulf war counterparts .
this , they said , suggested there was no " syndrome " .
however the team added it was too early to conclude that more symptoms in soldiers would not develop in the future . "
it is premature to conclude that there has been no effect of deployment to iraq " professor matthew hotopf , king 's college london stress of returning soldiers ' i had no support at home ' over 10,000 regular and ta soldiers completed a questionnaire asking if they had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder , common mental disorders , general wellbeing , alcohol consumption , physical symptoms or fatigue .
in addition to the difference in common mental disorders , such as anxiety and depression , the survey found ta soldiers had higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder , fatigue and physical symptoms such as chest pain , shaking bowel problems and sexual performance problems .
scott garthley , a former reservist who was injured while serving with 3 military intelligence battalion in iraq , says he was not given fast enough access to medical help after returning to the uk .
he told bbc news : " according to my spinal surgeon , had i waited for the timeframe that the mod were working to there was a less than 25 % chance that i may walk again .
lack of support " as far as psychiatrics are concerned , i developed quite bad post-traumatic stress and that was n't actually diagnosed and treatment started until 12 to 14 months after the event , " he added .
professor matthew hotopf , who led the study , said : " these findings are clearly important , because reservists are being used increasingly in iraq .
" we think the explanation centres on what happens before and after deployment , rather than while you are out there .
" reservists feel less prepared , and are not deployed in units in the same way as regulars . "
professor hotopf added that reserve soldiers may not be getting adequate support , from families and employers or from their regular army colleagues .
in addition , their health is looked after by the nhs , while full-time soldiers are looked after by the ministry of defence medical services .
the mod , which funded the kings college studies , said that in future , part-time soldiers diagnosed with ptsd or related problems would be offered outpatient treatment by the defence medical services .
defence minister tom watson said : " my department is carefully considering the recommendation that additional follow-up research is required . "
but shadow defence secretary liam fox said the report confirms that " the mod is using reserves as a substitute army , but without adequate training to deal with the sort of enemy action they face in iraq .
" this raises serious concerns with the levels of care being provided to our reservists who have taken part in operations in iraq , " he said .
' no new syndrome ' a second study by king 's college researchers looked at data on the health of 3,642 men who had served in iraq in 2003 was compared with 4,295 who were in service at that time but who were not deployed .
the researchers found small slight rises in irritability , forgetfulness , feeling distant or cut off , chest pain and night sweats among those who served in iraq in 2003 , compared with peers who did not go .
but the striking differences seen between those who served in the 1991 war and military personnel who were serving then but did not go to the gulf were not evident , the researchers said .
they suggest the difference may be explained by changes in how immunisations were administered - and an awareness that more interest was being taken in the health of serving personnel .
but professor hotopf said that , as ptsd was reported many years after soldiers returned after the 1991 war , longer-term research was warranted .
consideration charlie plumridge , of the national gulf war veterans and families association , welcomed the indication further research was needed .
" the position that the issue warrants continued investigation supports the veterans ' claims . "
and professor malcolm hooper , who advises veterans ' groups , said : " there is a real ill-health problem for some 2003 veterans .
" these papers seek to avoid it and ill-serve the sick veterans returning from this conflict . "

it comes after a report revealed 25 % of reservists who had fought in iraq experienced a mental health disorder , compared with 19 % of regular soldiers .
researchers at kings college in london said territorial army -lrb- ta -rrb- members had less support than the other soldiers .
but they added that overall , veterans suffered lower levels of illness than their 1991 gulf war counterparts .
this , they said , suggested there was no " syndrome " .
however the team added it was too early to conclude that more symptoms in soldiers would not develop in the future .
it is premature to conclude that there has been no effect of deployment to iraq professor matthew hotopf , king 's college london stress of returning soldiers ' i had no support at home ' over 10,000 regular and ta soldiers completed a questionnaire asking if they had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder , common mental disorders , general wellbeing , alcohol consumption , physical symptoms or fatigue .
in addition to the difference in common mental disorders , such as anxiety and depression , the survey found ta soldiers had higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder , fatigue and physical symptoms such as chest pain , shaking bowel problems and sexual performance problems .
scott garthley , a former reservist who was injured while serving with 3 military intelligence battalion in iraq , says he was not given fast enough access to medical help after returning to the uk .
he told bbc news : " according to my spinal surgeon , had i waited for the timeframe that the mod were working to there was a less than 25 % chance that i may walk again .

professor matthew hotopf , who led the study , said : " these findings are clearly important , because reservists are being used increasingly in iraq .
" we think the explanation centres on what happens before and after deployment , rather than while you are out there .
" reservists feel less prepared , and are not deployed in units in the same way as regulars . "
professor hotopf added that reserve soldiers may not be getting adequate support , from families and employers or from their regular army colleagues .
in addition , their health is looked after by the nhs , while full-time soldiers are looked after by the ministry of defence medical services .
the mod , which funded the kings college studies , said that in future , part-time soldiers diagnosed with ptsd or related problems would be offered outpatient treatment by the defence medical services .

dutch media say she will move to washington to work for the conservative american enterprise institute .
a tv documentary about her , shown last week , triggered calls for her to be stripped of her dutch passport .
ms hirsi ali , a fierce critic of conservative islam , is under 24-hour police protection .
she has received death threats since the murder of film-maker theo van gogh , who was stabbed by a radical islamist , mohammed bouyeri , in november 2004 .
she wrote the script for van gogh 's tv film submission , which angered many muslims .
ms hirsi ali did not deny that she had lied in her 1992 asylum application , her spokeswoman ingrid pouw told the bbc news website .
false data " everybody knew she lied about her asylum , " she said , explaining that ms hirsi ali had changed her name and birth date in her application .
she had also concealed the fact that she had arrived from kenya via germany , ms pouw said .
" she told them she came from somalia - that 's why she got a status asylum in just five weeks , " ms pouw said .
radio netherlands reports that ms hirsi ali had revealed the truth about her background in interviews and again in 2003 when the liberal-conservative vvd party asked her to stand as a parliamentary candidate .
ms hirsi ali will give a news conference at 1330 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- in the hague on tuesday , her spokeswoman said .
dutch immigration minister rita verdonk initially announced that ms hirsi ali would not be sanctioned over the asylum falsification .

dutch media say she will move to washington to work for the conservative american enterprise institute .
a tv documentary about her , shown last week , triggered calls for her to be stripped of her dutch passport .
ms hirsi ali , a fierce critic of conservative islam , is under 24-hour police protection .
she has received death threats since the murder of film-maker theo van gogh , who was stabbed by a radical islamist , mohammed bouyeri , in november 2004 .
she wrote the script for van gogh 's tv film submission , which angered many muslims .
ms hirsi ali did not deny that she had lied in her 1992 asylum application , her spokeswoman ingrid pouw told the bbc news website .
false data " everybody knew she lied about her asylum , " she said , explaining that ms hirsi ali had changed her name and birth date in her application .
she had also concealed the fact that she had arrived from kenya via germany , ms pouw said .
" she told them she came from somalia - that 's why she got a status asylum in just five weeks , " ms pouw said .
radio netherlands reports that ms hirsi ali had revealed the truth about her background in interviews and again in 2003 when the liberal-conservative vvd party asked her to stand as a parliamentary candidate .
ms hirsi ali will give a news conference at 1330 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- in the hague on tuesday , her spokeswoman said .
dutch immigration minister rita verdonk initially announced that ms hirsi ali would not be sanctioned over the asylum falsification .

people watched as the twister tore off roof tiles and picked up and carried rubbish across the sleaford area .
eyewitness paul golthorpe , from finch hatton close in ruskington , said he had never heard the wind make such an horrendous sound .
a trampoline was also seen by some eyewitnesses flying down the street after it was picked up by the tornado .
perfect conditions mr golthorpe said at first he had no idea what was causing the noise outside .
" we thought it was some low-flying jets but then the house started to shake a bit and i looked out of the window and saw lots of debris in the road , " he said .
bbc weather presenter jim gould said the tornado was small-scale but significant .
" on monday night the air destabilised and heavy showers developed with a large quantity of air in vertical motion .
" some of the air was moving upwards and some downwards at which point various physical forces take over and adds a certain amount of spin - creating the rotational characteristics that were seen in ruskington . "

the set - shown to the press ahead of thursday 's launch - was " a lot less well behaved " than previous years , the changing rooms host told the guardian .
the house is dominated by glass and an " inside out " theme , with a carpeted garden and grass in the kitchen .
meanwhile , the sun says there will not be enough beds for all 12 contestants .
the newspaper claims there will be three double beds , one more than last year .
' more twisted ' producers of channel 4 's reality show have promised big brother 7 will be " more twisted than ever " during its 13-week run .
producers say the contestants will be more exposed than ever they have deliberately included several glass walls and mirrors so contestants feel exposed and insecure while they are together .
llewelyn-bowen described the interior as resembling " glass-fronted , boudoir-inspired , flock-printed panic rooms " .
he said a dining table and stools - placed outside in keeping with the back-to-front theme - were " exquisite , absolutely beautiful , really refined , terribly elegant " .
overall , the look was " about wit and irony " , he said , and people would be " enormously interested " in it .
a member of the public will be admitted to the house as a competition winner .

the group 's latest survey reports that house prices in april rose for the sixth month in a row .
enquiries from buyers also rose , for a record 11th month in a row , and sales were 17 % up on a year ago .
" the rise of house prices suggests a return of confidence to the market boosted by a healthy economic climate , " said rics spokesman jeremy leaf .
to compile its data , the institution asks its members who work as estate agents if prices in their area are higher or lower than a year ago .
a positive balance between those answering yes or no suggests prices are generally rising , while a negative balance suggests they are falling .
in the latest survey , 15 % more surveyors reported that prices were rising than falling - up from the 12 % positive balance reported in april .
the figures tie in with those from other property market surveys , such as those from the nationwide , halifax , odpm and the land registry , which have all pointed to a brisk pick-up in prices in the early months of this year .
the rics says that the market is busiest in london and scotland but prices are still falling in the midlands .

the group 's latest survey reports that house prices in april rose for the sixth month in a row .
enquiries from buyers also rose , for a record 11th month in a row , and sales were 17 % up on a year ago .
" the rise of house prices suggests a return of confidence to the market boosted by a healthy economic climate , " said rics spokesman jeremy leaf .
to compile its data , the institution asks its members who work as estate agents if prices in their area are higher or lower than a year ago .
a positive balance between those answering yes or no suggests prices are generally rising , while a negative balance suggests they are falling .
in the latest survey , 15 % more surveyors reported that prices were rising than falling - up from the 12 % positive balance reported in april .
the figures tie in with those from other property market surveys , such as those from the nationwide , halifax , odpm and the land registry , which have all pointed to a brisk pick-up in prices in the early months of this year .
the rics says that the market is busiest in london and scotland but prices are still falling in the midlands .

figures from cancer research uk suggest a major reason may be that many men fail to check their moles .
fewer men than women are diagnosed with melanoma but more die of the illness because it is usually detected later , when it is more difficult to treat .
skin cancer is caused by over-exposure to the ultraviolet light from the sun .
men seem to be generally less aware of mole changes than women dr catherine harwood dr catherine harwood , of cancer research uk , said : " the thickness of a melanoma , at diagnosis , is very important in determining the outcome of the cancer .
" men seem to be generally less aware of mole changes than women and as a result they often present when the melanoma is already quite thick . "
the latest figures show 1,777 people , including 1,002 men , die from melanoma each year in the uk .
it is the second-fastest rising cancer in men after prostate .
cases of melanoma overall have risen 42 % in the last decade while prostate cancer has increased 48 % .
world-wide , the incidence of melanoma is roughly doubling every 10-20 years in countries with white populations .
melanomas in men are found most frequently on the trunk , followed by the head , neck , arm and leg .
complacency but a survey of 2,000 men conducted by cancer research uk showed almost 60 % never check their back for new moles or changes in existing moles .
almost 70 % of men questioned in the survey said they did not think they were at risk of skin cancer although one third of them admitted they had suffered from sunburn .
the poll also revealed that men under 24 years old and over 65 were the least likely to visit a doctor if they discovered changes or a new mole .
dr harwood said : " detecting a melanoma in its early stages means earlier treatment with a much better chance of survival . "
she urged people to be aware of changes in the skin including a new growth or a spot or mole that itches , hurts , bleeds or will not heal .
malignant melanoma is the most dangerous of the three forms and also the rarest .
it accounts for about 10 % of reported cases of skin cancer and can spread throughout the body to form secondary tumours .
basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of the disease but is rarely life-threatening .
squamous cell carcinoma spreads less rapidly and causes fewer deaths than melanoma .

figures from cancer research uk suggest a major reason may be that many men fail to check their moles .
fewer men than women are diagnosed with melanoma but more die of the illness because it is usually detected later , when it is more difficult to treat .
skin cancer is caused by over-exposure to the ultraviolet light from the sun .
men seem to be generally less aware of mole changes than women dr catherine harwood dr catherine harwood , of cancer research uk , said : " the thickness of a melanoma , at diagnosis , is very important in determining the outcome of the cancer .
" men seem to be generally less aware of mole changes than women and as a result they often present when the melanoma is already quite thick . "
the latest figures show 1,777 people , including 1,002 men , die from melanoma each year in the uk .
it is the second-fastest rising cancer in men after prostate .
cases of melanoma overall have risen 42 % in the last decade while prostate cancer has increased 48 % .
world-wide , the incidence of melanoma is roughly doubling every 10-20 years in countries with white populations .
melanomas in men are found most frequently on the trunk , followed by the head , neck , arm and leg .
complacency but a survey of 2,000 men conducted by cancer research uk showed almost 60 % never check their back for new moles or changes in existing moles .
almost 70 % of men questioned in the survey said they did not think they were at risk of skin cancer although one third of them admitted they had suffered from sunburn .
the poll also revealed that men under 24 years old and over 65 were the least likely to visit a doctor if they discovered changes or a new mole .

she urged people to be aware of changes in the skin including a new growth or a spot or mole that itches , hurts , bleeds or will not heal .

the european court of justice said the nhs must refund costs if patients waited longer than clinicians advised , even if waiting time targets were met .
the court was ruling in the case of yvonne watts , 75 , of bedford , who paid £ 3,900 for a hip operation in france .
but it said in her case uk courts would have to decide if she got a refund .
mrs watts said the news was " wonderful " and that if she got the money back she would donate it to a medical charity .
the case , which centres on the definition of " undue delay " , could have a significant impact on the nhs .
yvonne watts paid £ 3,900 for a hip operation in france it will allow any patient facing an unacceptable delay who has the funds to pay for an operation upfront to seek treatment abroad and recoup the costs from the nhs .
the department of health said it did not expect the judgment to make a big difference to the numbers travelling abroad to receive hospital treatment .
but it has already said it would be issuing new guidance on the issue in june .
mrs watts said : " i welcome it for what it means for other nhs patients .
that 's why i did it .
" if other people have to have hips done and have to go abroad , they 'll be encouraged . "
her solicitor , richard stein , said their victory would now act to regulate possible cutbacks in the nhs and increases in waiting times caused by financial constraints .
it should also help to make sure that the concept of " undue delay " was based on a medical decision , not just an arbitrary timeframe .

that 's why i did it mrs watts reaction to ruling q & a : nhs treatment abroad the european court of justice in luxembourg was asked to rule on the case after the english court of appeal sought its guidance .
the ecj said the uk government wrongly interpreted patients ' rights to access services in other eu countries .
it said just because waiting list targets had been met did not necessarily mean that a patient had not had to wait for an undue length of time for treatment .
instead primary care trusts must ensure a patient 's waiting time " does not exceed the period which is acceptable in the light of an objective medical assessment " of clinical need .
' flexible targets ' the court added the degree of pain the person is in and the nature of his or her disability must be taken into account .
also waiting time targets must be set " flexibly and dynamically " and reassessed if there is a deterioration in condition .
we need to understand the full implications of the court 's judgment before we make any changes department of health spokeswoman as authorisation for reimbursements of costs was usually sought before treatment was obtained , the primary care trust would be the body to decide on whether the patient was facing an undue delay .
however , the court found that it was for the british courts to decide whether mrs watts faced an undue delay and thus whether she should recoup her costs .
high court battle mrs watts , who is severely disabled , was told in september 2002 that she needed a double hip replacement and that she would have to wait around a year for the treatment .
but by the end of january 2003 , her condition had worsened and a consultant said she should be operated on within three or four months .
the primary care trust again then refused authorisation for treatment abroad saying she could receive it on the nhs within the " appropriate time " .
this was upheld in the high court .
but she decided to go ahead with an operation in the french town of abbeville in march 2003 nonetheless .

both mrs watts and the department of health then appealed to the court of appeal , which referred the matter to the european court of justice .
a department of health spokeswoman said : " we expect to continue with a system that requires any patient who wants to travel abroad for elective hospital treatment , paid for by the nhs , to be authorised to do this by their local healthcare commissioner before they receive treatment .
" however , we need to understand the full implications of the court 's judgment before we make any changes to the systems operated by the nhs . "
bedford primary care trust said it had applied " sound clinical judgement " at all times in the case of mrs watts and stressed the ruling did not decide whether she was eligible for a refund .
the court of appeal will decide whether mrs watts has her costs refunded .

a department of health spokeswoman said : " we expect to continue with a system that requires any patient who wants to travel abroad for elective hospital treatment , paid for by the nhs , to be authorised to do this by their local healthcare commissioner before they receive treatment .
" however , we need to understand the full implications of the court 's judgment before we make any changes to the systems operated by the nhs . "
bedford primary care trust said it had applied " sound clinical judgement " at all times in the case of mrs watts and stressed the ruling did not decide whether she was eligible for a refund .
the court of appeal will decide whether mrs watts has her costs refunded .

the court 's ruling was triggered by the case of yvonne watts , 75 , of bedford , who paid £ 3,900 for a hip operation in france .
richard stein , yvonne watts ' solicitor " the european court of justice has said , without a doubt , that people from the uk will now be able to go abroad for treatment if they face undue delay .
" the important thing is that the ecj has said the decision about whether a patient faces undue delay is a clinical one , rather than an administrative one .
" traditionally in the nhs , you tend to go to the end of the queue unless you 've got a particularly urgent case .
" now , when deciding what a reasonable waiting period is , the clinician has to decide with reference to you the patient , looking at the pain you are in and how debilitated you are . "
dr ed borman , chairman of the british medical association international committee " the bma welcomes the court 's view that government targets alone should not determine how long people have to wait for treatment .
" when patients seek treatment overseas , doctors should be free to make a decision based on their clinical need .
" what we need now is clear guidance from the government about the way patient mobility will work in practice .
" gps need to know how a patient should be referred to another member state for treatment , and the nhs needs to set out regulations for the reimbursement of cross-border care .
" it is important that the european commission is now ready to address the wider issues of doctors ' liability and patient safety .
" the ruling also highlights the need for continued investment in the nhs so we can treat patients as close to home as possible . "
dr scott greer , university college london dr greer , an expert on the influence of europe on uk health policy , said the court ruling was both " inevitable " and extremely serious because it now means we really have a european health system .
" standards of care are not going to be uniform .
" but what is going to be uniform is a regulatory framework which is extremely patchy , because it 's based on a few court cases , instead of legislation or a coherent framework . "
watts has made traditional rationing by waiting much more difficult he added : " not many british patients will use this ruling .
where we do have patient mobility in continental europe , the numbers are very small . "
" but every part of the nhs will have to ensure it is compliant with regulations which are still very vague .
" the previous court decisions were about countries in which you had to pay part of your health costs .
" in the uk , the nhs is free and universal at the point of treatment which means it rations by waiting .
" and there 's got to be some financial way to ration if there 's to be any control over the nhs budget .
" watts has made traditional rationing by waiting much more difficult . "
katherine murphy , patients association " we must ask ourselves why are people opting to go abroad ?
why do n't they want to stay with the nhs in this country ?
" what this case highlights is that we should be looking at improving our nhs here and making it a service that patients are proud of and want to use .
" i do n't think we should always be focused on meeting targets .
" mrs watts was obviously in a lot of pain and her quality of life was obviously affected .
" in this case , her gp should have researched and seen if there was anywhere else in the uk that would have performed this without her having to wait . "
ms murphy said the issue of patients going abroad for treatment raised the issue of cost and the possibility of feeling isolated from friends and family and who provides aftercare .
geoff martin , health emergency " today 's court ruling comes at a time when nhs services in the uk are under the heaviest financial pressure for more than a decade .
" we have no doubt that the current round of cutbacks will increase waiting times and that will see a wave of patients heading to europe for immediate treatment following today 's ruling .
" more money will bleed away from the nhs as the cash follows the patient overseas and that will store up even worse financial problems for the future . "
dr gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation " this is a sensible judgement .
it is absolutely right that people are treated on the basis of clinical need .
" as the nhs moves towards treating every patient within 18 weeks , problems like this should cease to be an issue .
" if patients do need to wait , then trusts will ensure that those patients are kept under review in case their situation should deteriorate .
" the service is striving to become more patient-led .
she added : " it seems unfair that patients who can afford to pay for treatment abroad and then claim back costs from their pct take advantage of this situation .
" this could potentially have a negative impact on those patients who can not afford to do this when the services in this country are n't as accessible .
" it must be wrong and completely inequitable to have a system where it is more affluent patients who receive treatment quicker as opposed to those with the highest clinical need . "
karen jennings , unison " this is the third time the european courts have said that people should be reimbursed for medical treatment if they have had to seek that treatment in a neighbouring eu country .
" this is no way to develop health policy .
health care priorities will end up skewed if the nhs has to reimburse those who are prepared to travel abroad for what may be less urgent operations .
" the eu needs to be more strategic about health policy because you can not rely on the courts to develop it in a way that is in the best interests of all .
" surely the answer has to be to build up capacity in our own nhs , so that people do n't have to wait in pain for too long and be forced to go abroad to seek treatment . "
dr michael dixon , nhs alliance " what this seems to do is to take the decision-making from on these difficult issues away from local nhs teams and they can be made elsewhere . "
he said most patients would want to be treated sooner than the date nhs could give them .
" most of my patients waiting for operations and other treatments would say they are having to wait unduly .
" in an ideal world , patients would be treated immediately and 100 % of operations would be successful .
" but this is the real world .
and if someone is treated early , someone else will have to be treated late . "
terrence o 'dwyer , stockholm network -lrb- european think-tank -rrb- " the ecj ruling is a victory for patients .
" it is an encouraging sign that europeans are becoming consumers with real legal rights of choice .
" the option of publicly funded treatment abroad will encourage efficiency and greater quality of care for patients . "
