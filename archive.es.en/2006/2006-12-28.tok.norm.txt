program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgarian 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

" it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .

germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency .

the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered .

plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

authorities did not disclose further information on the letter-writers , saying they did n't want to give the group any publicity . shadow of genoa ? the crime appears to be one of a growing number of violent acts attributable to militant opponents of the group of eight wealthiest industrial nations . the german office for the protection of the constitution warned in early december of possible attacks from left-wing extremist groups opposed to the policies of the g8 , a grouping of industrialised nations that comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . the annual g8 summits are often the focus of anti-globalization movement protests .
the most notable of these was at the 27th g8 summit in genoa , in 2001 , which was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police and the death of a 23-year-old protestor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical seaside resort heiligendamm will host g8 leaders in june growing number of attacks a spokesperson for the police group responsible for next year 's summit security said this was the 37th attack so far by miltant g8 opponents .
thirteen of the 37 attacks were arson attempts . germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- has voiced concern over the rise in left-extremist violence .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgarian 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .
-lrb- 24.07.2006 -rrb- germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

1 .
the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes .

" it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .

as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .

she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached .

further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .

and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.12.2006 " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz 's comments about the muslim headscarf have led to death threats ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .
dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .

the vandals also threw rocks and paint at his home .
mirow was economy minister in hamburg from 1997 to 2001 and has been deputy finance minister since 2005 . on wednesday , hamburg state police said a letter claiming responsibility for the attack led them to believe it was an act of protest against the g8 summit which is scheduled to take place in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm in june . the letter was sent to the hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
police said it claimed mirow 's position as deputy finance minister put him " at the controls of various strategic levers of power . "
authorities did not disclose further information on the letter-writers , saying they did n't want to give the group any publicity . shadow of genoa ? the crime appears to be one of a growing number of violent acts attributable to militant opponents of the group of eight wealthiest industrial nations . the german office for the protection of the constitution warned in early december of possible attacks from left-wing extremist groups opposed to the policies of the g8 , a grouping of industrialised nations that comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . the annual g8 summits are often the focus of anti-globalization movement protests .
the most notable of these was at the 27th g8 summit in genoa , in 2001 , which was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police and the death of a 23-year-old protestor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical seaside resort heiligendamm will host g8 leaders in june growing number of attacks a spokesperson for the police group responsible for next year 's summit security said this was the 37th attack so far by miltant g8 opponents .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency .

" it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .

the vandals also threw rocks and paint at his home .
mirow was economy minister in hamburg from 1997 to 2001 and has been deputy finance minister since 2005 . on wednesday , hamburg state police said a letter claiming responsibility for the attack led them to believe it was an act of protest against the g8 summit which is scheduled to take place in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm in june . the letter was sent to the hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
police said it claimed mirow 's position as deputy finance minister put him " at the controls of various strategic levers of power . "
authorities did not disclose further information on the letter-writers , saying they did n't want to give the group any publicity . shadow of genoa ? the crime appears to be one of a growing number of violent acts attributable to militant opponents of the group of eight wealthiest industrial nations . the german office for the protection of the constitution warned in early december of possible attacks from left-wing extremist groups opposed to the policies of the g8 , a grouping of industrialised nations that comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . the annual g8 summits are often the focus of anti-globalization movement protests .
the most notable of these was at the 27th g8 summit in genoa , in 2001 , which was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police and the death of a 23-year-old protestor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical seaside resort heiligendamm will host g8 leaders in june growing number of attacks a spokesperson for the police group responsible for next year 's summit security said this was the 37th attack so far by miltant g8 opponents .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

1 .
the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .

germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency .

" it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

1 .
the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.12.2006 " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz 's comments about the muslim headscarf have led to death threats ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .
dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.12.2006 patent protest erupts over human stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german scientists go abroad to be able to do their research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are some of the most restrictive in the world .
this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .

she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes .

1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .

but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .

it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached .

they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .

mirow was economy minister in hamburg from 1997 to 2001 and has been deputy finance minister since 2005 . on wednesday , hamburg state police said a letter claiming responsibility for the attack led them to believe it was an act of protest against the g8 summit which is scheduled to take place in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm in june . the letter was sent to the hamburger morgenpost newspaper .

1 .
the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.12.2006 " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz 's comments about the muslim headscarf have led to death threats ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .
dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .
she became a german citizen in 1997 .
she is married and has a child . jabeen bhatti interviewed ekin deligöz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hip-hop with a headscarf sahira is currently one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .
after finishing gymnasium , she studied public administration in constance and in vienna .
she joined the green party in 1989 and became a member of the bundestag in 1998 , where she has served as a spokesperson for child and family policy for her parliamentary group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.12.2006 bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the kozloduy reactors are likely to fall prey to the eu entry accords as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .
1 .
but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached . "
further oversight of bulgaria was deemed unnecessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite extensive rehabbing , the plants must still close the electricity produced in bulgararia plays a significant role in providing energy for the balkans , according to the european parliament .
they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .
“ but having a first-generation reactor is really like having an old car .
whatever you do , you ca n't change it over entirely to modern technologies . " the same goes for for western models as well as russian-built reactors , kastchiev clarified . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany .
-lrb- 26.12.2006 -rrb- german government plans new nuclear waste dump the german government , in its ongoing search for final storage locations for its nuclear waste , is considering constructing an atomic dump in the north-eastern state of saxony-anhalt , according to a german newspaper .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgarian 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .

she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.12.2006 " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz 's comments about the muslim headscarf have led to death threats ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .
dw-world.de spoke with the green party parliamentarian about her life as an immigrant and how she sees the future of integration . dw.world.de : how did you come to live in germany ? ekin deligöz : i was living in a small town in the middle of turkey with my grandparents when my mother , a teacher in istanbul , was invited by the german government to teach turkish children living in germany .
i moved with my mother to southern bavaria when i was eight . did you integrate into the turkish community in germany ? at the beginning , yes .
because my mother was a teacher , she had a really high status in the community .
there were always people coming into our house when they had some problems or needed help because she spoke german .
she was something between a translator and social worker .
still , when i went to high school , to gymnasium - as you know , the german system separates children at this age into three school tracks - i was the only foreigner in my class and there were only about two or three in the whole school .
as a result , i did not have a choice but to integrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has banned headscarves in schools why were you one of the few turkish children to attend gymnasium ? i think it was because of my mother .
she did all the small things that parents need to do , checking homework , talking with my teachers , working with me .
she was always telling me i do not have any other chance as a woman in a foreign country other than to go and study , learn something . my mother learned that from her parents .
my grandmother was the one that really pushed her , telling her , ‘ you have to go to school , it is very important for you .
we are not very rich and the only way for you to get something out of your life is to be educated . ’ in turkey , parents really pay a lot to get their children into private schools and make an effort to ensure their children get an education .
the turkish people in turkey are really doing a lot for their children ’ s education , more than the turkish people in germany . why did you want to be a politician ? i wanted to change the world .
i grew up with people and with books about people who didn ’ t have any chances in life .
i didn ’ t understand why i had such opportunities .
for example , all my turkish girlfriends were getting married at a time when i was still studying .
one told me that she was getting married and that it was the end of her life .
i asked her , ‘ why , you love your husband . ’
she told me to not be so naïve .
i wanted to change the world for such girls and for others without a chance . how do you see yourself ?
as german ?
as turkish ?
as something in between ?
how do germans see you ? i see myself as a turkish-german .
as for germans , well i can do anything but i am still turkish to them .
if questions , for example , about turkish politics come up , i am always asked as an expert .
i say , look , i have studied in germany , i have studied public administration here , the german system .
ask me about germany , not about turkey , it is not my chief issue .
sure i talk about the immigration stuff , but it is the immigration policy of germany , not turkey .
people will actually talk to me about social policy , sometimes really complex stuff then the last question will inevitably be , what about the people from your homeland .
and i reply , ' you are from my homeland . '
but they never forget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than eight million turks live in germany we all have to find our identity on our own .
i don ’ t have any problem to say i am an immigrant in germany .
a part of me is , and will always be turkish .
and a huge part of myself , my thinking , is german .
and it is okay to both .
there is a richness in this .
but the thing is , a lot of people think negatively about this .
for example , german parents are doing a lot to ensure their children are bilingual .
it is valued when it is german-english , or german-french but when it comes to turkish , it becomes something very negative .
it is the same with russian . do you think that attitude will ever disappear ?
if not , how can true integration occur ? people coming to germany as foreigners remain foreigners .
and when they get the right to live here and work here , they are still not allowed to be a german . it took until 1999 before germans admitted that we are a country of immigrants .
before , germans always looked at immigrants as guests and guests have to go back .
they didn ’ t realize that these people are not machines but people with families , with children who are growing up in germany .
for example , every fourth child in berlin is of a foreign background .
still , in germany , we give immigrants a lot but we don ’ t tell them that they are part of this country . what about the turkish community ?
do they have a responsibility to try harder to integrate ? yes but the thing is , they always have these negative experiences and are searching for an identity .
in turkey , we are not considered turkish anymore but are the ones from germany .
in germany , we are the ones from turkey .
and if the country you are living in doesn ’ t give you any signs of welcome , it is hard .
some decide to take responsibility and learn to fit in but some find other ways to create an identity , such as in religion for example .
that gets dangerous when religion is used as an instrument to build a parallel society , an ethnic colony , a unit looking for separation .
there is a responsibility in the communities themselves to say , our goal is not to be separated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of islamic extremism have risen since the failed bomb attacks in germany also , turkish parents have to change .
they are caring in the wrong way .
they are giving their children material security and doing their best but not pushing the most important thing , education .
many of the turkish people living in germany come from small towns in turkey and are not educated themselves ; some are even illiterate .
as a result , they are not really capable of knowing how important education is for the future of their children .
they don ’ t know how important it is to do the small things , to talk with children ’ s teachers , do homework together , even have a designated desk and books in the house . how do you see the future of germany in terms integration ?
do you think things will improve ? i hope so .
the most important thing will be to give young immigrants a chance , to give them an education a job , a future and optimism about the future .
if we are not able to do that , we don ’ t have a chance .
and we have to talk about immigrants as part of this country .
but there also has to be greater investment in education for immigrants , for their children .
for example , it is only the second year of our integration courses and we already have 50,000 more applications than courses .
if you give people the opportunity , they use it .
and we have to catch the children early .
ultimately , we are not in the position to lose even one of these children - these are the future of germany .
we have to take responsibility for them . how are you seen in the turkish community ? there are a lot of people standing behind me , saying that it is important what i am saying .
at the same time , there are also those who are against me and are very aggressive - because what i say threatens their conservative positions . you have taken a controversial position on headscarves that has led to death threats against you .
why take on such an explosive topic ? it hasn ’ t been easy , even within my own party .
there is this tendency towards tolerance - to accept and not ask questions .
but if you are not asking questions , what about the girls ?
you have to ask questions and look behind doors because tolerance means not looking away .
we live in germany and what kind of chance do these girls have if we say it is okay to stay separate ?
still , when you take such a position , you can be used by political conservatives who see the reaction and say , ‘ see , all immigrants are like this and the only thing to do is send them home . ’
but they are not able to see that there is no back to turkey anymore . ekin deligöz was born in tokat , turkey in 1971 and moved to senden , germany in 1979 .

1 .
the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency . " its -lrb- germany 's -rrb- position as a long-time partner for palestinians and at the same time a close friend of israel places germany in a strong position , " the diplomat said . the pro-israel american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- has also urged germany to use its presidency to push the eu to clearly voice its support for israel against ongoing threats from syria and iran . " it 's important for eu countries in various international bodies to be united in supporting israel against terrorist threats , " deidre berger , the berlin ajc director , told reuters .
" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .
" we hope that the momentum it created will not be endangered . " germany committed to peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian militants show their weapons germany will continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis during its eu presidency , plötner added . steinmeier received a call from lebanese prime minister fuad siniora tuesday to inform him about attempts by arab league chief amr mussa to mediate between lebanon 's pro-western government and syrian-backed opposition .
plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany holds the command of the naval component of the un force in lebanon , in its first military deployment in the middle east since world war ii . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olmert cautions berlin against including syria in peace process israeli prime minister ehud olmert has warned germany against drawing syria into the middle east peace process the day before he metwith german chancellor angela merkel in berlin .

but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say . to date , bulgaria has been the biggest electricity exporter in the balkans .
the kozloduy nuclear power plant , 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of sofia on the donau river , puts out energy for albania , greece , macadonia , romania , serbia , kosovo , and turkey . but this situation will end when bulgaria joins the eu .
even though the plants at kozloduy have been deemed safe by eu experts , under the terms of the country 's accession accord , the reactors must be shut down . the result is likely to be costly all around .
bulgaria will not only lose bilions of euros in export revenues , but electricity may become scarce , and costs are likely to soar . ' like a funeral ' greece and macedonia have already complained about the future of their resources . “ i feel like i 'm at a funeral , " said the acting director of the kozloduy plants . “ the units are in perfect condition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at work in number 3 : soon to close ?
in its heyday , the atomic power plant at kozloduy had six soviet-built reactors in its network , including four older , 440 megawatt ones , and two newer ones that produce 1000 megawatts .
a precondition for eu membership in the postcommunist era was turning off reactors 1 and 2 in 2002 . this came about after the seven leading industrial countries , the g7 , decided to shut down all first-generation reactors .
the question of whether to shut down reactors 3 and 4 was open for a while .
then bulgaria and the european commission agreed upon the 2006 shut-down date . recent survey have showed three quarters of bulgarians opposed to shutting down the reactors .
a citizens ' committee to save the atomic power plant estimated losses of up to 10 billion euros , due to missing revenue , higher costs for possible energy imports , and the cost associated with shutting down the reactors . ' legal obligation ' bulgarian president georgi parvanov told a radio interviewer he was worried about securing energy sources for the balkans , and fostered hopes for an extension of the shut-down deadline for kozloduy . he appears likely to be disappointed , according to roland kobia , who is responsible for nuclear policy in the european commission energy department . “ the situation is very clear , " kobia said .
" bulgaria has a legal obligation to shut down the plants , according to the terms of the eu entry agreement .
there is nothing to debate about . " yet it seems that bulgaria has indeed held out hope for a reprieve – or at least the possibility to put off the shut down .
it spent hundreds of millions of euros to invest in a system to bring up the reactors ' security systems to levels meeting eu recommendations .
a report by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- attested that the reactors , rehabbed in 1980 and 1982 were as secure as others that were just as old – and still allowed to operate in other eu countries . danger for the balkans in 2003 , bulgarian regulators issued operating licenses for kozloduy 3 and 4 until 2010 and 2012 , and according to eu controllers , all recommendations were " adequately approached .

they also said that " closing koslodui blocks 3 and 4 would destroy the delicate energy balance in a region that continues to be economically and politically unstable . " but the european commission insists on sticking to the eu entry accords , which state that all reactors of that generation must be shut down .
for its part , the bulgarian government has put up very little resistance , since opening up energy talks again would delay eu entry for the country by at least a year . safety warning yet there are those , even in bulgaria , who agree in principle with the eu .
georgi kastchiev , who was the head of the bulgarian atomic energy agency between 1997 and 2001 , welcomed the shut-down .
the move to close first-generation plants is " very good for safety . " the expert reports on kozloduy 3 and 4 may have been very diplomatically formulated , katschiev said , but he urged a closer look at the details : the security calculations were made under " realistic assumptions . "
but for the best possible security , the calculations should be made under what is called " conservative assumptions " – which means assuming that all possible security-system errors occur at the same time . “ the reconstruction improved the situation in many ways , " said kastchiev .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .
-lrb- 24.07.2006 -rrb- germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- 21.07.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods . german scientist oliver brüstle was elated when he discovered a way to create nerve cells from embryonic stem cells .
in 1999 , he gained approval for a patent for the method .
since then , however , the environmental organization greenpeace has fought that decision , afraid the patent could lead to commercial cloning . this month , the german federal patent court agreed with greenpeace and partially reversed their 1999 decision on brüstle 's patent , saying that anything made from human tissue can not be patented . brüstle believes the restriction will have devastating effects on terminally ill patients and the biotech industry as a whole . " here we are talking about the development of medical therapies , " brüstle said .
" academic research does n't have the capacity to thoroughly investigate this field ; we need to get the biotechnology industry involved . " " that will only happen when sufficient patent protection exists , " he added . for the greater good ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells greenpeace said that such patents are n't intended to help research , but only to help make research profitable . " even if research on embryos is to be allowed , it 's not right to commercialize the process , " said greenpeace 's christoph then .
" we believe there should be a clear separation between research and patenting products .
and the court decision affirmed this . " physicians also question whether patents in medicine are for the greater good . " when medical treatments can be patented , there is a chance that treatments will be delayed or will cost more , " said otmar kloiber , chairman of the world medical association . he cited a case a few years ago when a breast cancer-suppressing gene was patented . " as soon as the patent went through , the price for the treatment skyrocketed so that some insurance companies in the us were no longer able to cover the cost of treatment . " contested issues daniel besser , a stem cell researcher at the max delbrück center in berlin , takes a different approach . " it also costs a lot to develop this technology , " said besser .
" which branch of the industry can be expected to invest billions in their research and then make the information available for everyone to use for free ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell cultivation methods besser wants things to go a step further than patent protection , however , and other german scientists agree . current laws in germany ban the production of stem cell lines from embryonic cells .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 . the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . in november , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- - an influential research institute - said german researchers should be allowed access to newer stem cells produced overseas and that germany should permit the introduction of cell lines for diagnostic , preventative and therapeutic purposes . " serious problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say mice stem cells resemble those of humans stem cells can develop into different cell types and researchers say they offer the potential to treat serious conditions such as diabetes and parkinson 's disease and repair damaged organs or tissue . but otmar kloiber of the world medical association questions the hype around potential stem cell therapy . " it 's been said so many times that this would be a watershed for medical therapy , " he said .
" embryonic stem cell research started about 10 years ago and we have seen no therapeutic benefits for patients since then . " " in addition , the research on animals has shown that there are problems , serious problems , when you use this kind of therapy , " he added . brüstle , for his part , said he will appeal the german federal patent court verdict and take the case to the german constitutional court . axel rowohlt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the recent violence in the gaza strip has berlin concerned the fragile ceasefire could collapse . nudging middle east leaders and international mediators in the simmering conflict back on the path to peace will top germany 's agenda when it takes over the six-month european union presidency on jan.1. both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the mideast quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kickstart the peace process between israel and the palestinians . steinmeier said last week during a visit to moscow that the aim was for the group to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in light of the deadly conflict between palestinian factions and tentative hopes for peace talks .
" the carefully established lines of communications between israel and the palestinians can not be allowed to break , " he said , two days before israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas met for the first time in six months . german leadership seen as essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is committed to the mideast peace process germany occupies a unique position in the middle east due to its friendly ties to both palestine and israel . supporters of both sides have called on the country to use its eu presidency to focus on middle east issues . palestinian diplomat hael al-fahum said the german government can play a substantial role in the middle east .
germany has the chance and ability to propose a fair settlement to the middle east conflict , al-fahum told the reuters news agency .

" germany takes a clearer position on this question than some other eu states . " berlin worried by violence in gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis at the scene where a rocket hurt two teenaged boys .
the german government said wednesday it was deeply worried by the latest eruption of violence in the gaza strip and warned against allowing the fragile ceasefire to collapse . this week violence returned to the gaza strip as palestinian militants and israel exchanged rocket fire .
israel said it was not ending a month-long truce , but was forced to respond after a rocket attack wounded two israeli teenagers . " the situation in the gaza strip continues to fill us with great concern , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said at a news conference .
" it threatens the hard-won ceasefire for the gaza strip . " last week 's meeting between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas provided an " important and positive step , " plötner said .

plötner said siniora had received assurances that germany would continue its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the crisis under its eu presidency . steinmeier also spoke with mussa and thanked him for his efforts in lebanon .
" both agreed that the current crisis in lebanon can only be resolved with a solution supported by all the interest groups in the interest of national unity , " plötner said of wednesday 's telephone call .
steinmeier made a controversial visit to damascus this month in which he urged syria to do " everything in its power " to prevent the destabilization of lebanon . the trip was called " a mistake " by israeli prime minister ehud olmert .

organisers of the country 's largest street party , which will take place in edinburgh on sunday night , said they were keeping an eye on the predictions .
three years ago the event was cancelled at the last minute due to bad weather .
a spokesman said steps had been taken to deal with bad weather and that there would need to be " severe " gales before this year 's event would be halted .
organisers in glasgow , where 25,000 people are expected to attend celebrations in george square , also expect their event to go ahead .
a spokesman for the city council said it was aware that bad weather was being forecast .
' not fantastic ' but he said : " there are no anticipated problems at this stage .
" we are fortunate in george square to be right in the city centre - the fact that it 's a square provides a natural barrier .
" our main priority is the safety of those attending and we will continue to monitor the situation closely . "
forecasters have predicted that there could be gusts of up to 70mph as " very , very strong " wind and rain sweep across the central belt on 31 december .
a spokesman for edinburgh 's hogmanay 2007 said : " we are aware that the forecast is not fantastic .
we get the long-range forecast and are keeping an eye on the weather edinburgh hogmanay spokesman " however , the last few years has seen increased equipment put in place to cope with bad weather .
" there would have to be severe gales on the night for the event to be cancelled . "
more than 100,000 people are expected to attend the event , which is being headlined by pet shop boys and paolo nutini .
a huge firework display and series of outdoor events are also planned in the scottish capital .

it told another company , lianhuan pharmaceutical co , to stop making the pills and pay pfizer 300,000 yuan in damages .
new york-based pfizer recorded viagra sales of $ 1.65bn -lrb- £ 0.87bn -rrb- in 2005 .
the beijing court 's ruling is the latest episode in a lengthy legal battle by the firm to establish its patent rights in china .
in 2004 , china 's patent review board sided with chinese generic drug makers challenging pfizer 's exclusive right to make sildenafil citrate , the main active ingredient in viagra .
pfizer had appealed to china 's state intellectual property office -lrb- sipo -rrb- over the 2004 decision by the patent review board permitting more than a dozen chinese drug firms to use sildenafil citrate .
viagra was introduced in china six years ago and after six months on the market , state media said 90 % of the blue pills sold in shanghai were fake .
viagra is known locally as " weige " or " great brother " in chinese .

ex-minister stephen byers wrote to sir hayden phillips , who is reviewing party funding , warning that even arch labour modernisers would not agree to capping .
in the letter , seen by bbc news , he says a proposed £ 50,000 cap would wreck any chance of cross-party consensus .
sir hayden is due to publish his government-backed review in january .
labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party , which can reflect historic links .
draft proposal however , sir hayden emerged from two meetings with tony blair and downing street officials late last month with the impression that the labour leadership would accept a £ 50,000 limit on donations .
his draft proposal prompted an angry reaction from within the labour party , which fears it would endanger their funding - and historic links with - trade unions .
furious labour mps accused senior officials of directly contradicting official party policy .
mr byers , a blairite , has stepped in to draw the fire .
in the letter to sir hayden he says that even to a moderniser like him the proposals are unworkable .
pm 's position and he warned that without labour agreement the proposed reforms would fail .
the bbc understands the prime minister is aware of the letter 's contents which are said to reflect his " current thinking " .
the letter appears to be an attempt to shore up mr blair 's position inside his own party in the dying days of his premiership , says bbc political correspondent james hardy .
sir hayden , meanwhile , is believed to be looking at suggesting a voluntary approach to donations and spending .
the tories have called for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions , and tax relief for donations .
secret loans the funding review was ordered at the height of the " cash for honours " probe , initially prompted by the discovery that a number of people nominated for peerages had secretly lent money to the labour party .
it then emerged that ahead of the last election labour was secretly lent nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
until these revelations prompted a rule change , large loans on a commercial basis to political parties did not have to be publicly disclosed .
large donations already had to be declared .

ex-minister stephen byers wrote to sir hayden phillips , who is reviewing party funding , warning that even arch labour modernisers would not agree to capping .
in the letter , seen by bbc news , he says a proposed £ 50,000 cap would wreck any chance of cross-party consensus .
sir hayden is due to publish his government-backed review in january .
labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party , which can reflect historic links .
draft proposal however , sir hayden emerged from two meetings with tony blair and downing street officials late last month with the impression that the labour leadership would accept a £ 50,000 limit on donations .
his draft proposal prompted an angry reaction from within the labour party , which fears it would endanger their funding - and historic links with - trade unions .
furious labour mps accused senior officials of directly contradicting official party policy .
mr byers , a blairite , has stepped in to draw the fire .
in the letter to sir hayden he says that even to a moderniser like him the proposals are unworkable .
pm 's position and he warned that without labour agreement the proposed reforms would fail .
the bbc understands the prime minister is aware of the letter 's contents which are said to reflect his " current thinking " .
the letter appears to be an attempt to shore up mr blair 's position inside his own party in the dying days of his premiership , says bbc political correspondent james hardy .
sir hayden , meanwhile , is believed to be looking at suggesting a voluntary approach to donations and spending .
the tories have called for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions , and tax relief for donations .
secret loans the funding review was ordered at the height of the " cash for honours " probe , initially prompted by the discovery that a number of people nominated for peerages had secretly lent money to the labour party .
it then emerged that ahead of the last election labour was secretly lent nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
until these revelations prompted a rule change , large loans on a commercial basis to political parties did not have to be publicly disclosed .
large donations already had to be declared .
police are continuing to investigate whether peerages have been offered in exchange for cash .
all concerned in the inquiry deny wrongdoing .

ex-minister stephen byers wrote to sir hayden phillips , who is reviewing party funding , warning that even arch labour modernisers would not agree to capping .
in the letter , seen by bbc news , he says a proposed £ 50,000 cap would wreck any chance of cross-party consensus .
sir hayden is due to publish his government-backed review in january .
labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party , which can reflect historic links .
draft proposal however , sir hayden emerged from two meetings with tony blair and downing street officials late last month with the impression that the labour leadership would accept a £ 50,000 limit on donations .
his draft proposal prompted an angry reaction from within the labour party , which fears it would endanger their funding - and historic links with - trade unions .
furious labour mps accused senior officials of directly contradicting official party policy .
mr byers , a blairite , has stepped in to draw the fire .
in the letter to sir hayden he says that even to a moderniser like him the proposals are unworkable .
pm 's position and he warned that without labour agreement the proposed reforms would fail .
the bbc understands the prime minister is aware of the letter 's contents which are said to reflect his " current thinking " .
the letter appears to be an attempt to shore up mr blair 's position inside his own party in the dying days of his premiership , says bbc political correspondent james hardy .
sir hayden , meanwhile , is believed to be looking at suggesting a voluntary approach to donations and spending .
the tories have called for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions , and tax relief for donations .
secret loans the funding review was ordered at the height of the " cash for honours " probe , initially prompted by the discovery that a number of people nominated for peerages had secretly lent money to the labour party .
it then emerged that ahead of the last election labour was secretly lent nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
until these revelations prompted a rule change , large loans on a commercial basis to political parties did not have to be publicly disclosed .
large donations already had to be declared .
police are continuing to investigate whether peerages have been offered in exchange for cash .
all concerned in the inquiry deny wrongdoing .

the undertakers , known as nima tapu , meaning sacred hands , are forbidden from using their hands after preparing king tupou iv 's body for burial .
the nima tapu have spent the last three months confined in a special house where they are fed by other people .
after an end-of-mourning ceremony , the undertakers are allowed to return home .
royal taboo having touched the late king 's body during the funeral preparations , the royal undertakers are strictly forbidden from using their hands for any other purpose until the period of mourning is over .
the current generation of nima tapu are more fortunate than their predecessors .
until 300 years ago they would have been strangled or had their hands cut off following the king 's funeral .
tonga 's royal end-of-mourning ceremony , or pongipongi tuku , is characterised by gift-giving .
however , the new king tupou v has decreed that , in a change of protocol , the traditional gifts of food , pigs and the root drink kava should be presented to his mother queen halaevalu mata 'aho rather than to himself .
correspondents say the break with tradition may indicate king tupou v 's willingness to reshape tonga 's semi-feudal monarchy .
king tupou v has already promised more democratic reforms following pro-democracy rioting in november .
