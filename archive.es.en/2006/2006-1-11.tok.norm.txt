" british foreign secretary jack straw said referring iran to the un security council would " top the agenda " at the eu-3 talks . he said it would likely take place thursday , and a german foreign ministry spokesman said berlin would " very probably " be the venue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw straw -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced " profound concern " at iran 's move , a sentiment echoed in paris and berlin , where chancellor angela merkel said tehran was sending " worrisome signals . " " crossing the line " heightening the feeling of a rupture , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said iran had " crossed a line where the iranians knew that it would not remain without consequences . " europe and the united states fear that iran 's nuclear program could be a cover for developing atomic weapons , a charge tehran strongly refutes , saying is it for civilian purposes only . amid growing concerns , iran signed an agreement with the european union in paris in november 2003 to suspend all activities linked to enrichment . but formal talks ceased last august when tehran resumed uranium conversion , a final step before enrichment .
enriched uranium can be used to produce electricity as well as provide the basis for nuclear weapons . seal removal on tuesday , iran went a step further , announcing it was removing seals from nuclear facilities . " as of today , these centres resume their activities , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei a report by elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors confirmed the removal of seals from the natanz plant and said that the process would be completed wednesday at two other sites . iran will likely " begin low-scale enrichment testing " at natanz , said mark fitzgerald , a non-proliferation expert with london 's international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- . that " crosses a red line the europeans and americans have said , if crossed , would trigger other action , " he told afp . he said natanz has 164 centrifuges for uranium enrichment . even if these centrifuges can not produce enough uranium to make a bomb , " by mastering that technology " iran " would pass a point of no return in as much as it could then replicate this kind of -lrb- centrifuge -rrb- cascade ... in a clandestine , non-reported facility . " security council involvement ? the white house , warning of a " serious escalation " , threatened referral to the security council if iran failed to keep its international obligations and did not show a willingness to negotiate with the eu-3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators demanding the referral of iran 's nuclear file to the u.n. security council gregory schulte , the us ambassador to the iaea , said tehran " continues to choose confrontation " and " shows its disdain for international concern and its rejection of international diplomacy , " with this " deliberate step towards ... creating nuclear bomb material . " russia has also appealed to iran to " maintain the moratorium " on enrichment activities , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . tehran has up to now rejected a russian compromise deal to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran has broken nuclear commitments , says steinmeier german foreign minister steinmeier sharply criticized iran on monday after the islamic republic decided to resume its nuclear fuel research .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .

" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .

" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .

the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .

" british foreign secretary jack straw said referring iran to the un security council would " top the agenda " at the eu-3 talks . he said it would likely take place thursday , and a german foreign ministry spokesman said berlin would " very probably " be the venue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw straw -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced " profound concern " at iran 's move , a sentiment echoed in paris and berlin , where chancellor angela merkel said tehran was sending " worrisome signals . " " crossing the line " heightening the feeling of a rupture , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said iran had " crossed a line where the iranians knew that it would not remain without consequences . " europe and the united states fear that iran 's nuclear program could be a cover for developing atomic weapons , a charge tehran strongly refutes , saying is it for civilian purposes only . amid growing concerns , iran signed an agreement with the european union in paris in november 2003 to suspend all activities linked to enrichment . but formal talks ceased last august when tehran resumed uranium conversion , a final step before enrichment .
enriched uranium can be used to produce electricity as well as provide the basis for nuclear weapons . seal removal on tuesday , iran went a step further , announcing it was removing seals from nuclear facilities . " as of today , these centres resume their activities , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei a report by elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors confirmed the removal of seals from the natanz plant and said that the process would be completed wednesday at two other sites . iran will likely " begin low-scale enrichment testing " at natanz , said mark fitzgerald , a non-proliferation expert with london 's international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- . that " crosses a red line the europeans and americans have said , if crossed , would trigger other action , " he told afp . he said natanz has 164 centrifuges for uranium enrichment . even if these centrifuges can not produce enough uranium to make a bomb , " by mastering that technology " iran " would pass a point of no return in as much as it could then replicate this kind of -lrb- centrifuge -rrb- cascade ... in a clandestine , non-reported facility . " security council involvement ? the white house , warning of a " serious escalation " , threatened referral to the security council if iran failed to keep its international obligations and did not show a willingness to negotiate with the eu-3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators demanding the referral of iran 's nuclear file to the u.n. security council gregory schulte , the us ambassador to the iaea , said tehran " continues to choose confrontation " and " shows its disdain for international concern and its rejection of international diplomacy , " with this " deliberate step towards ... creating nuclear bomb material . " russia has also appealed to iran to " maintain the moratorium " on enrichment activities , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . tehran has up to now rejected a russian compromise deal to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran has broken nuclear commitments , says steinmeier german foreign minister steinmeier sharply criticized iran on monday after the islamic republic decided to resume its nuclear fuel research .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .

but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all .

" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .

theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .

" if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.01.2006 alternative climate alliance meets in sydney großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global warming threat has been recognized .
but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

" british foreign secretary jack straw said referring iran to the un security council would " top the agenda " at the eu-3 talks . he said it would likely take place thursday , and a german foreign ministry spokesman said berlin would " very probably " be the venue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw straw -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced " profound concern " at iran 's move , a sentiment echoed in paris and berlin , where chancellor angela merkel said tehran was sending " worrisome signals . " " crossing the line " heightening the feeling of a rupture , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said iran had " crossed a line where the iranians knew that it would not remain without consequences . " europe and the united states fear that iran 's nuclear program could be a cover for developing atomic weapons , a charge tehran strongly refutes , saying is it for civilian purposes only . amid growing concerns , iran signed an agreement with the european union in paris in november 2003 to suspend all activities linked to enrichment . but formal talks ceased last august when tehran resumed uranium conversion , a final step before enrichment .
enriched uranium can be used to produce electricity as well as provide the basis for nuclear weapons . seal removal on tuesday , iran went a step further , announcing it was removing seals from nuclear facilities . " as of today , these centres resume their activities , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei a report by elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors confirmed the removal of seals from the natanz plant and said that the process would be completed wednesday at two other sites . iran will likely " begin low-scale enrichment testing " at natanz , said mark fitzgerald , a non-proliferation expert with london 's international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- . that " crosses a red line the europeans and americans have said , if crossed , would trigger other action , " he told afp . he said natanz has 164 centrifuges for uranium enrichment . even if these centrifuges can not produce enough uranium to make a bomb , " by mastering that technology " iran " would pass a point of no return in as much as it could then replicate this kind of -lrb- centrifuge -rrb- cascade ... in a clandestine , non-reported facility . " security council involvement ? the white house , warning of a " serious escalation " , threatened referral to the security council if iran failed to keep its international obligations and did not show a willingness to negotiate with the eu-3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators demanding the referral of iran 's nuclear file to the u.n. security council gregory schulte , the us ambassador to the iaea , said tehran " continues to choose confrontation " and " shows its disdain for international concern and its rejection of international diplomacy , " with this " deliberate step towards ... creating nuclear bomb material .

handbags at dawn ?
or just a big yawn ?
europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .
the row did n't even show up on the radar of the french and polish papers which didn ’ t print a relevant word . organizing committee 's nerves fraying , say swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kasier lost his cool over the stiftung warentest report .
in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .
" we trust authorities like the police and fire brigade 100 percent , " said federation secretary general sune hellströmer on wednesday . british " shadenfreude " over stadium furor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new wembley stadium will look like this ... if it ever opens .
as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .

eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously . " at the same time , energy prices have risen , " she said .
" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year .

" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .
now they are building massive liquefaction plants there . " it will still take years for liquid gas and the nabucco pipeline to become viable alternatives .
the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.01.2006 europe searches for alternatives to russian gas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will ships soon become a viable alternative transportation method for gas ?
following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

29 , 2005 -rrb- rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

" when there 's criticism from abroad - whether from germany or elsewhere - it does n't necessarily have to mean a worst case scenario in relations , " janes said . janes said that while german-american relations were " somewhat difficult " , there were " more positive than negative " aspects involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall was a central element of german-us relations during the cold war the end of the cold war and the fall of the wall had significantly changed this relationship .

" i would n't stress the word ' new ' too much , though , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at john hopkins university in washington . janes said in an interview with dw-world that merkel 's visit would usher in a change in mood .
both sides were eager to improve ties and were set for something positive to come out of the trip . " this explains the great efforts by the white house to organize the visit and the gesture that merkel resides in the official guest house , " said janes .
" these are signals which say : we are very delighted that she is coming to washington .

these included russia , the middle east and iran . " there are plenty of problems , which we have to tackle together , " janes said . german criticism not a worst case scenario merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo was " absolutely acceptable " , said janes , in particular considering the increasing condemnation of the prison camp in the united states . " when there 's criticism from abroad - whether from germany or elsewhere - it does n't necessarily have to mean a worst case scenario in relations , " janes said . janes said that while german-american relations were " somewhat difficult " , there were " more positive than negative " aspects involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall was a central element of german-us relations during the cold war the end of the cold war and the fall of the wall had significantly changed this relationship .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .

handbags at dawn ?
or just a big yawn ?
europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .
the row did n't even show up on the radar of the french and polish papers which didn ’ t print a relevant word . organizing committee 's nerves fraying , say swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kasier lost his cool over the stiftung warentest report .
in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .
" we trust authorities like the police and fire brigade 100 percent , " said federation secretary general sune hellströmer on wednesday . british " shadenfreude " over stadium furor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new wembley stadium will look like this ... if it ever opens .
as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

" if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .

" we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .

" if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.01.2006 the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an detention camp in kosovo was allegedly run by the cia so far , there has been no concrete proof of secret cia prisons in europe .
but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ?

it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .

" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously . " at the same time , energy prices have risen , " she said .
" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year . " we 're also in talks with potential providers , " she added . viable alternatives ? as liquid gas is becoming cheaper , gas producers such as algeria , iran , central america or qatar are becoming more attractive for western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar is banking on liquid gas " a country such as qatar was simply unable to compete , " energy business professor schmitt said .
" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .
now they are building massive liquefaction plants there . " it will still take years for liquid gas and the nabucco pipeline to become viable alternatives .
the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas .

but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .

europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous .

europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .

" british foreign secretary jack straw said referring iran to the un security council would " top the agenda " at the eu-3 talks . he said it would likely take place thursday , and a german foreign ministry spokesman said berlin would " very probably " be the venue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw straw -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced " profound concern " at iran 's move , a sentiment echoed in paris and berlin , where chancellor angela merkel said tehran was sending " worrisome signals . " " crossing the line " heightening the feeling of a rupture , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said iran had " crossed a line where the iranians knew that it would not remain without consequences . " europe and the united states fear that iran 's nuclear program could be a cover for developing atomic weapons , a charge tehran strongly refutes , saying is it for civilian purposes only . amid growing concerns , iran signed an agreement with the european union in paris in november 2003 to suspend all activities linked to enrichment . but formal talks ceased last august when tehran resumed uranium conversion , a final step before enrichment .
enriched uranium can be used to produce electricity as well as provide the basis for nuclear weapons . seal removal on tuesday , iran went a step further , announcing it was removing seals from nuclear facilities . " as of today , these centres resume their activities , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei a report by elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors confirmed the removal of seals from the natanz plant and said that the process would be completed wednesday at two other sites . iran will likely " begin low-scale enrichment testing " at natanz , said mark fitzgerald , a non-proliferation expert with london 's international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- . that " crosses a red line the europeans and americans have said , if crossed , would trigger other action , " he told afp . he said natanz has 164 centrifuges for uranium enrichment . even if these centrifuges can not produce enough uranium to make a bomb , " by mastering that technology " iran " would pass a point of no return in as much as it could then replicate this kind of -lrb- centrifuge -rrb- cascade ... in a clandestine , non-reported facility . " security council involvement ? the white house , warning of a " serious escalation " , threatened referral to the security council if iran failed to keep its international obligations and did not show a willingness to negotiate with the eu-3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators demanding the referral of iran 's nuclear file to the u.n. security council gregory schulte , the us ambassador to the iaea , said tehran " continues to choose confrontation " and " shows its disdain for international concern and its rejection of international diplomacy , " with this " deliberate step towards ... creating nuclear bomb material . " russia has also appealed to iran to " maintain the moratorium " on enrichment activities , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . tehran has up to now rejected a russian compromise deal to enrich iranian uranium on russian soil . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran has broken nuclear commitments , says steinmeier german foreign minister steinmeier sharply criticized iran on monday after the islamic republic decided to resume its nuclear fuel research .

" i would n't stress the word ' new ' too much , though , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at john hopkins university in washington . janes said in an interview with dw-world that merkel 's visit would usher in a change in mood .
both sides were eager to improve ties and were set for something positive to come out of the trip . " this explains the great efforts by the white house to organize the visit and the gesture that merkel resides in the official guest house , " said janes .
" these are signals which say : we are very delighted that she is coming to washington .

these included russia , the middle east and iran . " there are plenty of problems , which we have to tackle together , " janes said . german criticism not a worst case scenario merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo was " absolutely acceptable " , said janes , in particular considering the increasing condemnation of the prison camp in the united states . " when there 's criticism from abroad - whether from germany or elsewhere - it does n't necessarily have to mean a worst case scenario in relations , " janes said . janes said that while german-american relations were " somewhat difficult " , there were " more positive than negative " aspects involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall was a central element of german-us relations during the cold war the end of the cold war and the fall of the wall had significantly changed this relationship .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .

" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .

" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .

" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .

the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously . " at the same time , energy prices have risen , " she said .
" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year . " we 're also in talks with potential providers , " she added . viable alternatives ? as liquid gas is becoming cheaper , gas producers such as algeria , iran , central america or qatar are becoming more attractive for western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar is banking on liquid gas " a country such as qatar was simply unable to compete , " energy business professor schmitt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.01.2006 the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an detention camp in kosovo was allegedly run by the cia so far , there has been no concrete proof of secret cia prisons in europe .
but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .

handbags at dawn ?
or just a big yawn ?
europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .
the row did n't even show up on the radar of the french and polish papers which didn ’ t print a relevant word . organizing committee 's nerves fraying , say swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kasier lost his cool over the stiftung warentest report .
in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .
" we trust authorities like the police and fire brigade 100 percent , " said federation secretary general sune hellströmer on wednesday . british " shadenfreude " over stadium furor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new wembley stadium will look like this ... if it ever opens .
as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously . " at the same time , energy prices have risen , " she said .
" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year . " we 're also in talks with potential providers , " she added . viable alternatives ? as liquid gas is becoming cheaper , gas producers such as algeria , iran , central america or qatar are becoming more attractive for western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar is banking on liquid gas " a country such as qatar was simply unable to compete , " energy business professor schmitt said .
" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .
now they are building massive liquefaction plants there . " it will still take years for liquid gas and the nabucco pipeline to become viable alternatives .
the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas . " the project of a european liquid gas terminal must swiftly move forward , " piebalgs recently said in an interview with dw-radio 's russian service . steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas read more about the europe 's dependency on russian gas in this dw-world dossier .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .

this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .
the pipes are meant to cross turkey and balkan countries , bypassing russia .
construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously . " at the same time , energy prices have risen , " she said .
" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year . " we 're also in talks with potential providers , " she added . viable alternatives ? as liquid gas is becoming cheaper , gas producers such as algeria , iran , central america or qatar are becoming more attractive for western europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar is banking on liquid gas " a country such as qatar was simply unable to compete , " energy business professor schmitt said .
" the costs for liquefaction and transportation were too high .
now they are building massive liquefaction plants there . " it will still take years for liquid gas and the nabucco pipeline to become viable alternatives .
the pipeline will start operations in 2011 at the earliest , and liquid gas is not a significant factor in germany - unlike in spain or italy . but the eu has made it clear that it plans to bank on liquid gas .

following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia . gas is moving again from russia to ukraine , but trust in the russian energy giant gasprom has been hurt .
what remains is an uncomfortable feeling of too much dependency on russian gas - and the fear that russia could abuse its energy reserves as a political instrument . as a result , the austrian eu presidency has been pushing for a discussion of energy policy during the bloc 's spring meeting .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs has called for a common european energy policy . energy experts said the eu should definitely act after the gas dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas is an important energy source for europe " the danger of a high dependency on imports has become clear , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , adding that the dependency could get even worse if european states do n't start diversifying their gas delivery methods . the fact that gas consumption is expected to rise by a third by 2020 is n't helping . at the same time , german and dutch gas deliveries - currently 16 and 19 percent respectively - will drop significantly , according to dieter schmitt , an energy business professor at essen university .
he added that the norwegian gas delivery potential has been maxed out as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's hold on europe few doubt that russia will remain the most important gas provider for germany - a fact manifested in the new baltic sea pipeline , which is meant to connect western europe with siberia 's gas fields and which was backed by former german chancellor gerhard schröder . circumventing russia nevertheless , commissioner piebalgs and other eu officials are now starting to talk about alternative pipelines such as the so-called nabucco project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has the world 's second-largest gas reserves nabucco is the name for the plans of austria 's omv energy company to tap iranian and central asian gas reserves .

construction of the 4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8-billion -rrb- pipeline is expected to commence this year . " if you believe the prognoses , the need for gas will rise tremendously in europe , " otto musilek , the head of omv 's gas division , told dw-world .
" we 've started the nabucco project knowing that we need new sources and alternative transport routes to deal with this enormous need . " but the plan to use central asian reserves has irked moscow , which currently forces these countries to deliver their gas to russia in order to resell it to european customers . " russia has a massive interest to prevent the pipeline , " said diw 's kemfert . experts and gas industry officials also see great potential in liquefying gas .
during this process , the raw material gets chilled to minus 163 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 261.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before it is loaded onto huge tanker ships .
until now , this procedure has been extremely expensive and , therefore , uneconomical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is still not a common fuel for cars but astrid zimmermann , a spokeswoman for german energy company eon , said that costs for ships and liquefaction plants have been lowered tremendously .

" that 's why liquid gas is becoming another option next to pipeline gas . " eon plans to build the first liquid gas terminal in germany in wilhelmshaven in order to import gas from the middle east and north africa .
zimmermann said that a feasibility study will probably be completed this year .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .

in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .
" we trust authorities like the police and fire brigade 100 percent , " said federation secretary general sune hellströmer on wednesday . british " shadenfreude " over stadium furor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new wembley stadium will look like this ... if it ever opens .
as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .

as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

" british foreign secretary jack straw said referring iran to the un security council would " top the agenda " at the eu-3 talks . he said it would likely take place thursday , and a german foreign ministry spokesman said berlin would " very probably " be the venue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw straw -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced " profound concern " at iran 's move , a sentiment echoed in paris and berlin , where chancellor angela merkel said tehran was sending " worrisome signals . " " crossing the line " heightening the feeling of a rupture , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said iran had " crossed a line where the iranians knew that it would not remain without consequences . " europe and the united states fear that iran 's nuclear program could be a cover for developing atomic weapons , a charge tehran strongly refutes , saying is it for civilian purposes only . amid growing concerns , iran signed an agreement with the european union in paris in november 2003 to suspend all activities linked to enrichment . but formal talks ceased last august when tehran resumed uranium conversion , a final step before enrichment .
enriched uranium can be used to produce electricity as well as provide the basis for nuclear weapons . seal removal on tuesday , iran went a step further , announcing it was removing seals from nuclear facilities .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

" i would n't stress the word ' new ' too much , though , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at john hopkins university in washington . janes said in an interview with dw-world that merkel 's visit would usher in a change in mood .
both sides were eager to improve ties and were set for something positive to come out of the trip . " this explains the great efforts by the white house to organize the visit and the gesture that merkel resides in the official guest house , " said janes .
" these are signals which say : we are very delighted that she is coming to washington .

these included russia , the middle east and iran . " there are plenty of problems , which we have to tackle together , " janes said . german criticism not a worst case scenario merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo was " absolutely acceptable " , said janes , in particular considering the increasing condemnation of the prison camp in the united states . " when there 's criticism from abroad - whether from germany or elsewhere - it does n't necessarily have to mean a worst case scenario in relations , " janes said . janes said that while german-american relations were " somewhat difficult " , there were " more positive than negative " aspects involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall was a central element of german-us relations during the cold war the end of the cold war and the fall of the wall had significantly changed this relationship .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing .

or just a big yawn ?
europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .
the row did n't even show up on the radar of the french and polish papers which didn ’ t print a relevant word . organizing committee 's nerves fraying , say swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kasier lost his cool over the stiftung warentest report .
in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .
" we trust authorities like the police and fire brigade 100 percent , " said federation secretary general sune hellströmer on wednesday . british " shadenfreude " over stadium furor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new wembley stadium will look like this ... if it ever opens .
as could be expected , the british took the opportunity to divert their own shortcomings in the stadium stakes by commenting on the germans .
" forget the little thing about the opening date of the new wembley stadium , " the times wrote , " germany has some proper stadium problems . "
the new national stadium in london has been beset with constructional problems and the official opening date is far from certain . the daily mirror , however , took a more somber tone , recounting britain 's experiences of tragedy at soccer stadiums .
with the disasters at heysel , hillsborough and bradford in mind , the mirror warned : " the masses at this year 's world cup in germany could be in danger , as there seems to have been nothing learnt from past disasters .

davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.01.2006 alternative climate alliance meets in sydney großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global warming threat has been recognized .
but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .

europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous .

the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics . " the swiss tabloid blick commented that the blast from the ok will certainly not be the last to be heard on the subject and it foresaw a rumbling disagreement that will last until the beginning of the world cup on june 9 and beyond . much of the scandinavian press offered a sensible take on the whole row by putting its faith in the german organizers and the emergency services . the view was supported by the swedish soccer federation which was widely quoted in the press as saying that the massive criticism of german stadiums was no reason for restlessness .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .

iran 's nuclear facility in natanz iran has resumed its nuclear power program .
but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .

handbags at dawn ?
or just a big yawn ?
europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .
the row did n't even show up on the radar of the french and polish papers which didn ’ t print a relevant word . organizing committee 's nerves fraying , say swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der kasier lost his cool over the stiftung warentest report .
in switzerland , the neue züricher zeitung wrote about the " fraying nerves of the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . "
the paper commented on the apparent over reaction of the ok to the report by consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's into stadium safety , saying that it took barely a word to stir the ok into a round of " accusations and polemics .

europe 's papers are n't fussed while the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- blows its top over the consumer watchdog stiftung warentest 's report on stadium safety , the row has barely registered with the european press . some might have described it as a storm in a tea cup or handbags at dawn but some european newspapers were taking an altogether more cautious look at the row developing in germany over the reported deficiencies in standards at the country 's world cup stadiums . the italians barely covered the story in the press but a radio report on tuesday stated that while the stadiums in germany were " nice " , it could not be ruled out that some could be " nicely dangerous . " spanish papers also steered clear of the touchy subject with only el mundo offering more than a few lines on the world cup - and even then the article made no mention of the stadium furor .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .
the former us ambassador to germany , daniel coats informed former interior minister otto schily over the matter . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de evidence allegedly found of secret cia prisons in europe swiss intelligence services are allegedly in possession of proof that the us has detained terror suspects in secret prisons in various european countries .

but the commotion about it by politicians in the european union and the united states is unjustified , according to deutsche welle 's peter philipp . european politicians who are currently worked up about iran resuming its nuclear research should add something substantiated - which goes beyond the hitherto general knowledge - to their cassandra calls of impending disaster . only when the interested public is better informed can it follow the arguments of those who are threatening with the un security council and sanctions - even though , just a few months ago , they thought they could incorporate iran by diplomatic means into a system that is , in itself , unique . it is unique because the e-3 - britain , france and germany - believed they could demand of iran something that would n't be asked of anyone else . although tehran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and accepted the auxiliary protocol , it should abstain from every form of uranium enrichment and now , even nuclear research .
these are things which every other country in a similar situation would be allowed to do ; and countries who have n't even signed the npt , such as india , pakistan or israel , are not even concerned about . distrust of the iranian leadership the sole possible reason for such behavior towards iran might be the deep distrust that the europeans ultimately bear against the leaders of the " islamic republic . "
it is a distrust that indeed appears justified against the background of the outrageous statements by mahmoud ahmadinejad , but is much older than the iranian president 's term in office . after all , the nuclear crisis with iran began during the term of president mohammed khatami , who was well-liked in the west .
iranian nuclear policies are even much older . but in all these years , europe has craved the grace of iran as an economic partner .
it has , in favor of its own economic interests , turned a blind eye to human rights violations , the lack of civic freedom , as well as the oppression and persecution of political opponents in iran . all of a sudden now , iran is supposed to apparently develop into the greatest threat in the region .
because no one wants to believe that it wants to use nuclear energy for power generation despite its immense oil and gas deposits ?
or maybe because no one " trusts those mullahs an inch " ? openness instead of sanctions the europeans actually wanted to negotiate with iran , in order to demonstrate to washington that something can be achieved by diplomatic means .
it appears there 's nothing left of these ambitions . the white house can be proud of the european support .
but the transatlantic anti-iran coalition is nothing more than a paper tiger .
everyone knows that in the security council , sanctions would be met with china 's opposition and probably also its veto . sanctions have never brought about anything anywhere anyway .
but openness and sincerity have .
it is an invitation not only to tehran , but also even more so to the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran risks rupturing international talks over nuclear program iran , by resuming sensitive nuclear research activities despite stinging western criticism , risks finally rupturing fragile ties with the european union and now faces un referral , officials and experts warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.01.2006 alternative climate alliance meets in sydney großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global warming threat has been recognized .
but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .

but now , a swiss newspaper says it has evidence .
what is the next step ? the latest clue of alleged secret cia interrogation centers in europe comes from egyptian sources .
and of course , eu justice minister franco frattini found out about it exactly the way the european public did : through the media .
and while there remains little concrete proof of the existence of these prisons , the problem is , is that the eu has little legal room to maneuver begin searching for such evidence - to settle the issue once and for all . " we have no clear provision in eu law to handle something like this , " said friso abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" the compliance with human rights is left to the member states .
and when they breach the human rights conventions , then it is the province of the council of europe to investigate . " the strasbourg-based organization is not an organ of the eu but an independent body of states whose chief mission is to monitor compliance to the european conventions on human rights and prohibiting torture . the organization has 46 members including romania , bulgaria , macedonia , ukraine , poland and serbia-montenegro , the states in which the alleged prisons were being operated . report on prisons due in january the council of europe has already appointed its own investigator , dick marty of switzerland , who is to present his report at the end of january .
theoretically , all member states have a duty to cooperate with the investigation .
still , the general secretary of the council of europe , terry davis , has already criticized , for example , kosovo , for denying the council 's committee against torture access to its detention centers .
davis has hinted that the peacekeepers in kosovo may have to become involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were allegedly more than 400 cia " rendition " flights in germany alone and should the council find proof that poland , romania and bulgaria cooperated with illegal cia operations , then the eu would have to react with strong penalties , said frattini already in november , after the allegations first surfaced . " if there comes proof that a member of candidate state allows or allowed such detention centers on their territory , and by doing so did not meet the standards for the treatment of prisoners , then we will have the duty to decide on how to handle the serious breach in eu law , " frattini said . until now , the official stance of the eu was to believe the denials emanating from poland , bulgaria and romania , said abbing . " but we have to find out the true facts , " he said .
" we are just not there yet . " finding an explanation toward clearing up the issue , the european parliament could play a role .
eu legislators want in the coming weeks to create a special committee to deal with the issue of secret prisons , secret transfers and torture or suspected terrorists in the eu . still , an official committee with investigative powers can not be established because there is no provision in the law providing the parliament such jurisdiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : how did german officials react to the el masri kidnapping , and when independent from the efforts of the eu and the council of europe , prosecutors in italy and in germany are exploring what legal avenues they can take regarding the alleged secret cia flights transporting suspected terrorists through european countries . in germany in particular , the question remains when and how the previous red-green coalition government had reacted upon being informed of the cia abduction of german citizen , khaled el-masri .
he was captured by the cia in macedonia and brought to afghanistan .

but how best to fight it ?
this week , australia is hosting the first climate-change conference for a new asia-pacific environmental alliance that includes the us , china and india .
critics are warning of an end-run around the kyoto accords . for years now , the us has been criticized by the environmental community for its refusal to sign the kyoto agreement , which calls for certain countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
us president george w. bush only recently admitted a connection between greenhouse gases and global warming , and has said washington needs to set goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's great barrier reef : the country did not sign the kyoto accord along with the us , australia , japan and south korea , both of the world 's most populous countries - china and india , with their burgeoning economies - are taking part as well .
together , these six countries are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas production .
focus on storage technologies one of the focal points of the group 's first conference will be the development of climate-protection technologies .
in september , the us developed a strategic plan as part of its four-year-old climate change technology program -lrb- cctp -rrb- . the plan stresses the need to research carbon dioxide storage technologies to use in connection with used oil and gas storage stations , called carbon capture and storage technologies , or ccs .
at a climate change conference last month in montreal , participants who did sign the kyoto protocol agreed to support the development of ccs technologies . moreover , the sydney attendees will be looking for possibilities to reduce greenhouse gases during aluminum production , which is very energy intensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog in beijing .
china is the second-largest co2 producer at the heart of the new alliance is an attempt to expand energy consumption while at the same time reducing greenhouse gases .
in contrast to the kyoto signatories - who are pinning hopes on a system of trading in emissions licenses - they want to achieve change via new technology .
in this way , washington in particular hopes to avoid possible negative economic effects from climate protection measures . an attempt to avoid kyoto ? critics , such as the european union , have accused the asia-pacific partners of trying to undermine the kyoto agreements . but ottmar edenhofer , of the potsdam institute for climate research , says a power struggle between the opposing climate alliances is nothing but a mock debate , at least in terms of economic impact . success without sanctions ? " it is clear that we need a world wide certificate-trading system as well as a technology accord and technological cooperation .
it is the only reasonable way to take the edge off the conflict between economic growth and climate protection . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial pollution in brazil there is another reason the eu has been skeptical toward the new asia-pacific meeting ; in contrast to the kyoto protocol , which threatens to sanction states that fail to meet their goals , the asia-pacific group 's agreements are purely voluntary in nature .
there are no set goals to meet for reducing greenhouse gases .
in 1997 , the kyoto accords stated that by 2012 , 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels .
only the us and australia refused to ratify the accord . for climate expert edenhofer , there are no workable alternatives to setting definitive emissions goals , and not only because china is now the second-largest carbon dioxide producing nation . " these ambitious technologies that the asian-pacific partnership want to promote will only be successful in the international marketplace when carbon dioxide -lrb- emission -rrb- comes at a cost .
and there can only be a reasonable cost when there is a possibility of sanctions .
i think there will be a learning process in the usa , and in the other nations . " cause for hope the potsdam based researcher is skeptical that the asian-pacific partnership and the kyoto signatories will pull together any time soon in the fight against climate change . nonetheless , he said , the recent past gives cause for hope : " two years ago , most people were skeptical that there would even be emissions trading .
today this system is working on the eu level .
that 's why i am not completely without hope when it comes to international processes .

china is increasingly looking to africa for oil and gas as its economy booms .
but the chinese are looking too at other african resources - particularly its timber reserves .
in the meantime , there is western concern that some of beijing 's partnerships are providing a shield for undemocratic and corrupt practices .
booming economy there are also fears they could also damage the continent 's environment through over-exploitation .
this latest trip to africa by the chinese foreign minister is concentrated mainly on west africa where beijing 's portfolio of activities is growing exponentially .
li zhaoxing will be going to senegal , cape verde , liberia , mali and nigeria .
the relationship between china and africa has obvious mutual benefits - china is growing fast and needs resources , africa has them and needs investment to exploit them .
just this week , one of china 's biggest state-run oil corporations confirmed a two billion dollar stake into the akpo oil and gas field , off the nigerian coast .
this deal , once signed , will rival china 's substantial involvement in sudan 's oil industry .
china has also recently moved into petroleum in gabon , algeria , angola and egypt .
african oil is largely responsible for a 40 % increase in trade with china in a single year .
and while western companies hesitate about investing in africa , china 's been mopping up zambia 's copper industry , buying into south african coal and gold , kenya 's mobile phone business , zimbabwe tobacco , botswana hotels , and the list goes on .
the united states and europe are only belatedly waking up to the strategic implications of all this , especially as they too are looking to diversify from middle east oil .

the service was first offered by premier cars but has since been taken up by other taxi firms in the city .
the scheme lets the driver send a text to the waiting passenger telling them their car is about to arrive .
the message contains details of the make , model and colour of the car as well as the registration number .
alison parry , a director at premier cars , which has a 200-strong fleet , said they began offering the service as a way of giving their passengers extra security following reports of bogus taxi drivers sexually assaulting female passengers . "
we introduced the service because there had been a lot of reports in the press about bogus taxis and taxis not being safe " alison parry , premier taxi she said : " if someone is in a busy pub for example and they are waiting for a taxi , this service lets them know exactly who is going to turn up and when so it gives them added peace of mind .
" we introduced the service because there had been a lot of reports in the press about bogus taxis and taxis not being safe .

" but now if someone phones us from a mobile to book a taxi , we can offer them a text back . "
ms parry said that the service , which costs the customer 50p , worked for both the passenger and the driver .
' good service ' she added : " if someone is in a busy pub and they are n't waiting outside , sometimes the driver will wait for a while but when no one comes out for the taxi they will leave because there is no way they 'd be able to find the customer in a busy bar .
" this way , the driver can send a text to the customer and hopefully they will come straight out . "
a spokeswoman for personal safety charity , the suzy lamplugh trust , welcomed the scheme .
she said : " this is a good service because people have been known to pretend to be cabs when they are n't .
" but this scheme lets people know exactly what car they should be looking out for .
" we always recommend to people booking a taxi that they ask what the make of car will be and to ask the driver who they have come to pick up .

" this way , the driver can send a text to the customer and hopefully they will come straight out . "
a spokeswoman for personal safety charity , the suzy lamplugh trust , welcomed the scheme .
she said : " this is a good service because people have been known to pretend to be cabs when they are n't .
" but this scheme lets people know exactly what car they should be looking out for .
" we always recommend to people booking a taxi that they ask what the make of car will be and to ask the driver who they have come to pick up .
" this scheme makes it far easier to identify the right cab . "

leaders from 70 countries , including eight presidents , attended the lavish and colourful ceremony .
in a brief speech , mr nazarbayev repeated his goal to make kazakhstan " one of the world 's 50 most competitive states " .
the international community has said december 's election was not democratic .
nr nazarbayev pledged to " serve kazakhstan 's people , respect laws and the constitution of kazakhstan , and guarantee the rights and liberties of its citizens " .
speaking in the presidential palace in the capital , astana , he then bent to kiss the national flag , before a long round of applause from the audience .
mr nazarbayev has headed the oil-rich central asian state since 1989 - two years before independence .
he is deemed to have brought kazakhstan prosperity and stability but to have concentrated power in the hands of close associates and trampled the opposition .
the bbc 's central asia correspondent , ian macwilliam , says much of the focus at mr nazarbayev 's inauguration was on oil .
reports suggest the ukrainian leader victor yushenko wants to discuss possible routes for new gas pipelines from central asia to ukraine to lessen his country 's dependence on russian gas .
the karachaganak gas field in kazakhstan is one of the world 's largest and is due to significantly increase production in the next few years .
central asia 's leaders would also like new export routes for their abundant gas and oil .
currently , they can only export their gas through soviet-era pipelines through russian territory .
with more control over their export pipelines , the central asians could demand world market prices .

it adds academies cost £ 27m to start up , compared with £ 2.2m for a " fresh start " school .
it 's a great job but they are making it impossible to do mick brookes national association of head teachers heads reject ' naive ' report nao head sir john bourn said it was " unacceptable for any school to carry on providing a poor education over a period that can take up a large part of a child 's school career and deprive them of future prospects and opportunity " .
edward leigh , chairman of the house of commons public accounts committee , said : " local authorities , ofsted and the department for education and skills must act faster either to get these schools to improve or close them before their pupils ' chances in life are ruined . "
the government said that the report was an endorsement of the plans in its education white paper to speed up intervention when inspectors find weaknesses in schools .
" no school will be allowed to languish in special measures , with any school failing to show improvement after 12 months facing closure , " said schools minister , jacqui smith .
" new inspection arrangements will ensure that coasting is no longer an option , schools will only be deemed good if they demonstrate continuing improvement and parents will have new rights to trigger ofsted inspections , " she said .
conservative education spokesman david willetts said the report provided " powerful evidence that the quality of education in too many of our schools is sub-standard " .
liberal democrat spokesman ed davey said good head teachers were vital but government meddling was turning people off the profession .

chief constable jon stoddart and councillor anne wright , chairman of durham police authority , talked to senior civil servants on wednesday .
they outlined a provisional business plan , but also voiced concerns about who would pay for set up costs .
northumbria police also favour of a three-way merger with cleveland police .
but the cleveland force is against the plan and wants to join up with durham for the creation of a tees valley force .
after wednesday 's meeting , a spokesman for durham police said a follow-up meeting was being planned with mr clarke .
in a letter already sent to the home secretary , mrs wright has also pressed for an early " face-to-face " exchange with mr clarke to debate the future of policing in the north east and the possibility of a first-phase merger between the northumbria and durham forces .
she said : " on the basis of all the evidence we have collated we remain firmly convinced that , if amalgamations are to go ahead , the only sensible option for the north east is a single regional force .
' waste of time ' " however , we do have significant concerns about initial set-up costs , the implications for council tax and the establishment of an effective mechanism for holding the police service to account at neighbourhood level .
" we are unable to see how any amalgamation proposals can be sensibly progressed until these issues are properly resolved by the government . "
however , the chair of cleveland police authority accused them of wasting their time .
councillor dave mcluckie said : " there is something bizarre about their call for ' urgent talks ' when at the same time they apparently recognise that proposals about any amalgamations can not be sensibly progressed until key issues such as who will pay for the changes , the impact on council tax payers and the crucial question of keeping the police accountable to the communities they serve are answered by the government .
" as the association of police authorities has made crystal clear , until the government come up with the answers , any discussions on possible options are just a waste of time . "
