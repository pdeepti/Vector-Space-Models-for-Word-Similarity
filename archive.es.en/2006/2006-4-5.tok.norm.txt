dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .

after being held hostage with six others for 74 days , the german government negotiated for her release .
weigel was flown from the jungle hide-out to the capital bogota in a helicopter .
upon her return , she received a bill for over 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- from the german foreign ministry - for its share of the expenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhilt weigel , returning to her home in bremen in 2003 the ministry had based its demands on german consular law , which states that if the government helps germans in financial need or danger abroad , it can reclaim the costs afterwards .
but weigel 's lawyer , josef mayer , argued that the law did not apply to hostages . " the fundamental decision that was made today makes it clear , that - at least by current law - the foreign ministry can only demand reimbursement in cases where german citizens are in financial distress , " mayer said .
" for example , if a citizen is abroad and their return airplane ticket is stolen , then the german foreign ministry is required to replace it for them .
the same holds true for hostages , and if the ministry gives them money for their return flight , then they must repay these costs as well . " since reinhilt weigel paid for her own flight home , mayer argued , she should not be required to pay for the additional costs of her liberation .

paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .
that is what i call a process . in paraguay we have managed what all other countries find very difficult : a generation breakthrough .

no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

some hospital administrators said cutting personnel may be their only option . every day , some 6,000 doctors in 23 cities across germany trade their stethoscopes and scalpels for whistles and signs , and the hospitals where they work lose between 250,000 euros and 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 245,000 and $ 735,000 -rrb- , according to the german hospital association 's andreas priefler . " the strikes are hitting the hospitals down to the bone , " he told süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" if the strikes take longer , it could reach hundreds of millions . " " the strikes are becoming more and more of a threat to our hospital 's economic existence , " read a letter to düsseldorf university hospital employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operations have dropped by 40 percent roland grabiak , of the düsseldorf hospital called the strikes an " economic disaster , " adding that it would take months of regular operation before the hospital would be back on its feet as patient rates have dropped by a third , with 60 percent of operations being performed . job cuts to recover losses possible that 's exactly the effect frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund doctor 's union - which has around 22,000 members - has been hoping for . " the strikes will continue for as long as employers insist on additional income cuts , " he said at a demonstration tuesday in ulm . an effect montgomery has hoped to avoid has , however , now been put forth by some hospital administrators .
they have made it clear that revenue losses caused by the strikes could result in personnel reductions . " we have to seriously consider if we want to continue employing so many young people , " jörg tarnow , head of the düsseldorf clinic said .
" since more than 70 percent of our budget goes to personnel costs , it is clear where the savings measures will have to focus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the strikes , some doctors may be washing windows for a living a hospital in erlangen , where operations have dropped by 20 percent , has gone 2.6 million euros into the red due to the strikes , hospital spokesman johannes eissing told the associated press .
he said the losses were equal to 54 jobs . eissing said other means of recovering the missing funds were being considered , and added that the hospital would n't be able to make any decisions until the striks are over and it 's clear how many patients come back . no end to strikes in sight for the moment the unions do not seem fazed by the hospitals ' potential plans . " this is a normal employer reaction , " verdi 's martin körbel-landwehr said .
" we are not going to be scared away by this threat . " but since the negotiators are n't even at the bargaining table , the marburger bund seems to be assuming that there wo n't be a deal soon .
it 's already planned further protests for april 11 and april 25 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german strikes drag on , french protests escalate " not again !

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .
things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .
just a few weeks later , germany 's chancellor at the time , gerhard schröder , visited moammar gadhafi in a traditional bedouin tent outside of tripoli .
britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is extremely rich in oil libya is one of germany 's strongest trading partners in northern africa .
last year , germany exported goods to libya worth 657.7 million euros -lrb- $ 805.7 million -rrb- , according to the german federal statistics office . " the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .
it will be the first high-level visit by a dutch official since gadhafi took power in 1969 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new german-libyan beginning german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi have agreed to expand political and business ties between their countries after their second meeting in tripoli .

ruiz , one of uruguay 's coaching stars , has a reputation as a polite , refined coach , which keeps him in good standing with the paraguayan media and public . dw-world.de : what can be said about the paraguay team based on its world cup preparations ? anibal ruiz : i think our preparations up to the moment have been good .
we have taken care of the logistics for our participation in the world cup , we 're visiting all the national team players , observing what our opponents are doing and keeping up with how our injured players are healing , as is the case with roque santa cruz . you were named south america 's 2005 coach of the year .
was that recognition for the development of soccer in paraguay ? yes , of course .
paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .
that is what i call a process . in paraguay we have managed what all other countries find very difficult : a generation breakthrough .
the teams that tried it did n't qualify for the world cup , but we did it smoothly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney , right , and david beckham will be difficult opponents what is paraguay 's plan for the world cup ? paraguay has to do better in 2006 than in 2002 and 1998 .
we know how difficult our group is : sweden , england , and trinidad and tobago are not easy opponents . we want to be a main player in germany and to do that we 're going to have to rely on our expertise , and our skills and prove why our players can play in the best leagues in italy , spain , germany , mexico and brazil .
we do n't just want to be participants in germany but protagonists . what is your evaluation of your opponents ? there are no easy opponents at the world cup .
the 32 best teams take part and the path to the final is full of hurdles .
we 're actually going to be playing against three european teams . under leo beenhakker 's instruction , trinidad and tobago play a very " dutch " game .
paraguay is not going to have a problem with that , we realize and respect that the next opponent is always the most difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roque santa cruz should be back in shape for the world cup where are paraguay 's strengths ? the best player on our team is the team itself .
rationality and structure are essential , with them we 'll be able to do it .
paraguay wo n't be an easy opponent for anyone . what can paraguay still improve ? quite a bit .
we have to work on new alternatives to make sure our opponents do n't know us by heart . will these alternatives change depending on the opponent ? they will have to . what does the world cup mean for you ? every coach dreams of being there .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest event , and it 's where you learn a lot and can test your skills and knowledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruiz may be dreaming of the trophy , but he is n't telling anyone about it how far do you realistically think paraguay will make it ? our idea is to move on step by step .
getting through the first round is the first step . so you do n't have any dreams or goals ?
no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .
we still want to show new things , a more beautiful game .
we have a solid house , now we 're putting in the beautiful furniture . daniel martínez interviewed anibal ruiz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interviews with the stars read dw-world.de 's other interviews with the coaches and players in the 2006 world cup .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .

bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?
visitors say no .
" it is just great art , pure and simple , " said student andreas meissner , who visited the show .
besides , before coming to berlin , " melancholy " drew over 300,000 people during its three-month run at the grand palais in paris .
but then , the french are n't doing so well at the moment either .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .

rice also briefed steinmeier on her weekend trip to iraq with british foreign secretary jack straw . us reluctant steinmeier earlier tuesday had pressed the iran issue with white house national security advisor stephen hadley after he arrived in washington monday for a two-day visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program has been a concern for both germany and the us " based on reports that there are apparently talks taking place arranged by the american ambassador in baghdad with the iranian leadership about the situation in iraq , i advised that the topics should not be limited just to iraq but expanded to include one of the most urgent problems confronting us all : the suspicion that iran , the iranian leadership , is pursuing secret atomic weapons programs , " he told reporters . steinmeier said a debate had begun in the united states about direct us-iranian negotiations on the nuclear issue , which he and his british counterpart jack straw backed , but noted the us government appeared reluctant . " we are oversimplifying the situation if we say that there is european pressure on the united states , on the american administration - this is above all an internal american discussion , " he said . " but at the moment , i can not see any signs that they are prepared to take part in such discussions . " no direct meeting until now , the united states has limited its diplomacy on the iranian nuclear program to two forums : the un security council and the vienna-based international atomic energy agency . iran 's charge d 'affaires in iraq , hassan kazemi gomi , said tuesday that talks between iran and the united states on the situation in iraq would take place in baghdad with iraqi participation .
no date was set . any direct meeting would mark a break in a near three-decade pause in direct contacts between us and iranian officials following the country 's 1979 islamic revolution and the subsequent us hostage drama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state condoleezza rice with her counterparts in berlin last week rice was in berlin last thursday for a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany on the iranian nuclear program . ministers of the six countries discussed the road ahead one day after the council adopted a non-binding statement urging iran to halt within 30 days all uranium enrichment activities , which western leaders fear are part of an effort to build an atomic bomb . steinmeier said that recent iranian tests of a new land-to-sea missile in the gulf were damaging to the negotiations , particularly in light of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's open calls for " israel to be wiped off the map " . afghanistan , india also on agenda apart from iran , steinmeier brought up with washington the case of a german-turkish citizen , murat kurnaz , held at the us prison camp in guantanamo since 2002 , and developments in the middle east and afghanistan , where berlin has a major peacekeeping contingent . steinmeier said there were " no further decisions " on kurnaz after his talks with rice , but said he would stay in close contact with washington over the case . they also addressed last month 's landmark us-indian nuclear deal in which the united states agreed to provide nuclear technology in exchange for india separating its civil and military atomic programs and agreeing to inspections . steinmeier earlier renewed his criticism that the timing of the accord was " not helpful " in light of the iranian nuclear dispute , but said germany could come to support it if it were the " start of a process " that eventually integrated india into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it has refused to sign . the german diplomat left washington late tuesday on a flight back to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier in washington discusses iran german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on an official two day visit to the us , ahead of a trip to washington by german chancellor angela merkel scheduled for may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2006 opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade has yet to deliver the remaining war criminals sought by the hague tribunal the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .
dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe . " bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .
-lrb- march 14 , 2006 -rrb- eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .

macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?

it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia .

the teams that tried it did n't qualify for the world cup , but we did it smoothly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney , right , and david beckham will be difficult opponents what is paraguay 's plan for the world cup ? paraguay has to do better in 2006 than in 2002 and 1998 .
we know how difficult our group is : sweden , england , and trinidad and tobago are not easy opponents . we want to be a main player in germany and to do that we 're going to have to rely on our expertise , and our skills and prove why our players can play in the best leagues in italy , spain , germany , mexico and brazil .
we do n't just want to be participants in germany but protagonists . what is your evaluation of your opponents ? there are no easy opponents at the world cup .
the 32 best teams take part and the path to the final is full of hurdles .
we 're actually going to be playing against three european teams . under leo beenhakker 's instruction , trinidad and tobago play a very " dutch " game .
paraguay is not going to have a problem with that , we realize and respect that the next opponent is always the most difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roque santa cruz should be back in shape for the world cup where are paraguay 's strengths ? the best player on our team is the team itself .
rationality and structure are essential , with them we 'll be able to do it .
paraguay wo n't be an easy opponent for anyone . what can paraguay still improve ? quite a bit .
we have to work on new alternatives to make sure our opponents do n't know us by heart . will these alternatives change depending on the opponent ? they will have to . what does the world cup mean for you ? every coach dreams of being there .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest event , and it 's where you learn a lot and can test your skills and knowledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruiz may be dreaming of the trophy , but he is n't telling anyone about it how far do you realistically think paraguay will make it ? our idea is to move on step by step .
getting through the first round is the first step . so you do n't have any dreams or goals ?
no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .
we still want to show new things , a more beautiful game .
we have a solid house , now we 're putting in the beautiful furniture . daniel martínez interviewed anibal ruiz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interviews with the stars read dw-world.de 's other interviews with the coaches and players in the 2006 world cup .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .

" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .

" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "

" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .

until now the results had always been negative , according to the ministry .
officials expect to know on thursday if the virus was the aggressive asian form responsible for over 100 deaths . the h5n1 strain has been found in wild birds in seven of germany 's states , stretching from the baltic sea to lake constance , and reached berlin late last month when a dead buzzard found on the balcony of an apartment block in the capital was confirmed to have had the virus . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves more aid to farmers hit by bird flu the european commission cleared the way wednesday to release more eu aid to farmers hit by a slump in poultry consumption due to recent outbreaks of bird flu across europe .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .

rice also briefed steinmeier on her weekend trip to iraq with british foreign secretary jack straw . us reluctant steinmeier earlier tuesday had pressed the iran issue with white house national security advisor stephen hadley after he arrived in washington monday for a two-day visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program has been a concern for both germany and the us " based on reports that there are apparently talks taking place arranged by the american ambassador in baghdad with the iranian leadership about the situation in iraq , i advised that the topics should not be limited just to iraq but expanded to include one of the most urgent problems confronting us all : the suspicion that iran , the iranian leadership , is pursuing secret atomic weapons programs , " he told reporters . steinmeier said a debate had begun in the united states about direct us-iranian negotiations on the nuclear issue , which he and his british counterpart jack straw backed , but noted the us government appeared reluctant . " we are oversimplifying the situation if we say that there is european pressure on the united states , on the american administration - this is above all an internal american discussion , " he said . " but at the moment , i can not see any signs that they are prepared to take part in such discussions . " no direct meeting until now , the united states has limited its diplomacy on the iranian nuclear program to two forums : the un security council and the vienna-based international atomic energy agency . iran 's charge d 'affaires in iraq , hassan kazemi gomi , said tuesday that talks between iran and the united states on the situation in iraq would take place in baghdad with iraqi participation .
no date was set . any direct meeting would mark a break in a near three-decade pause in direct contacts between us and iranian officials following the country 's 1979 islamic revolution and the subsequent us hostage drama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state condoleezza rice with her counterparts in berlin last week rice was in berlin last thursday for a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany on the iranian nuclear program . ministers of the six countries discussed the road ahead one day after the council adopted a non-binding statement urging iran to halt within 30 days all uranium enrichment activities , which western leaders fear are part of an effort to build an atomic bomb . steinmeier said that recent iranian tests of a new land-to-sea missile in the gulf were damaging to the negotiations , particularly in light of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's open calls for " israel to be wiped off the map " . afghanistan , india also on agenda apart from iran , steinmeier brought up with washington the case of a german-turkish citizen , murat kurnaz , held at the us prison camp in guantanamo since 2002 , and developments in the middle east and afghanistan , where berlin has a major peacekeeping contingent . steinmeier said there were " no further decisions " on kurnaz after his talks with rice , but said he would stay in close contact with washington over the case . they also addressed last month 's landmark us-indian nuclear deal in which the united states agreed to provide nuclear technology in exchange for india separating its civil and military atomic programs and agreeing to inspections . steinmeier earlier renewed his criticism that the timing of the accord was " not helpful " in light of the iranian nuclear dispute , but said germany could come to support it if it were the " start of a process " that eventually integrated india into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it has refused to sign . the german diplomat left washington late tuesday on a flight back to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier in washington discusses iran german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on an official two day visit to the us , ahead of a trip to washington by german chancellor angela merkel scheduled for may .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .
just a few weeks later , germany 's chancellor at the time , gerhard schröder , visited moammar gadhafi in a traditional bedouin tent outside of tripoli .
britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is extremely rich in oil libya is one of germany 's strongest trading partners in northern africa .
last year , germany exported goods to libya worth 657.7 million euros -lrb- $ 805.7 million -rrb- , according to the german federal statistics office . " the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .
it will be the first high-level visit by a dutch official since gadhafi took power in 1969 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new german-libyan beginning german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi have agreed to expand political and business ties between their countries after their second meeting in tripoli .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .

britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples .

european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent .

" the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .

" no direct meeting until now , the united states has limited its diplomacy on the iranian nuclear program to two forums : the un security council and the vienna-based international atomic energy agency . iran 's charge d 'affaires in iraq , hassan kazemi gomi , said tuesday that talks between iran and the united states on the situation in iraq would take place in baghdad with iraqi participation .
no date was set . any direct meeting would mark a break in a near three-decade pause in direct contacts between us and iranian officials following the country 's 1979 islamic revolution and the subsequent us hostage drama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state condoleezza rice with her counterparts in berlin last week rice was in berlin last thursday for a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany on the iranian nuclear program . ministers of the six countries discussed the road ahead one day after the council adopted a non-binding statement urging iran to halt within 30 days all uranium enrichment activities , which western leaders fear are part of an effort to build an atomic bomb . steinmeier said that recent iranian tests of a new land-to-sea missile in the gulf were damaging to the negotiations , particularly in light of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's open calls for " israel to be wiped off the map " . afghanistan , india also on agenda apart from iran , steinmeier brought up with washington the case of a german-turkish citizen , murat kurnaz , held at the us prison camp in guantanamo since 2002 , and developments in the middle east and afghanistan , where berlin has a major peacekeeping contingent . steinmeier said there were " no further decisions " on kurnaz after his talks with rice , but said he would stay in close contact with washington over the case . they also addressed last month 's landmark us-indian nuclear deal in which the united states agreed to provide nuclear technology in exchange for india separating its civil and military atomic programs and agreeing to inspections . steinmeier earlier renewed his criticism that the timing of the accord was " not helpful " in light of the iranian nuclear dispute , but said germany could come to support it if it were the " start of a process " that eventually integrated india into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it has refused to sign . the german diplomat left washington late tuesday on a flight back to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier in washington discusses iran german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on an official two day visit to the us , ahead of a trip to washington by german chancellor angela merkel scheduled for may .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .

britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent .

" the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?
visitors say no .
" it is just great art , pure and simple , " said student andreas meissner , who visited the show .
besides , before coming to berlin , " melancholy " drew over 300,000 people during its three-month run at the grand palais in paris .

rice also briefed steinmeier on her weekend trip to iraq with british foreign secretary jack straw . us reluctant steinmeier earlier tuesday had pressed the iran issue with white house national security advisor stephen hadley after he arrived in washington monday for a two-day visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program has been a concern for both germany and the us " based on reports that there are apparently talks taking place arranged by the american ambassador in baghdad with the iranian leadership about the situation in iraq , i advised that the topics should not be limited just to iraq but expanded to include one of the most urgent problems confronting us all : the suspicion that iran , the iranian leadership , is pursuing secret atomic weapons programs , " he told reporters . steinmeier said a debate had begun in the united states about direct us-iranian negotiations on the nuclear issue , which he and his british counterpart jack straw backed , but noted the us government appeared reluctant . " we are oversimplifying the situation if we say that there is european pressure on the united states , on the american administration - this is above all an internal american discussion , " he said . " but at the moment , i can not see any signs that they are prepared to take part in such discussions . " no direct meeting until now , the united states has limited its diplomacy on the iranian nuclear program to two forums : the un security council and the vienna-based international atomic energy agency . iran 's charge d 'affaires in iraq , hassan kazemi gomi , said tuesday that talks between iran and the united states on the situation in iraq would take place in baghdad with iraqi participation .
no date was set . any direct meeting would mark a break in a near three-decade pause in direct contacts between us and iranian officials following the country 's 1979 islamic revolution and the subsequent us hostage drama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state condoleezza rice with her counterparts in berlin last week rice was in berlin last thursday for a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany on the iranian nuclear program . ministers of the six countries discussed the road ahead one day after the council adopted a non-binding statement urging iran to halt within 30 days all uranium enrichment activities , which western leaders fear are part of an effort to build an atomic bomb . steinmeier said that recent iranian tests of a new land-to-sea missile in the gulf were damaging to the negotiations , particularly in light of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's open calls for " israel to be wiped off the map " . afghanistan , india also on agenda apart from iran , steinmeier brought up with washington the case of a german-turkish citizen , murat kurnaz , held at the us prison camp in guantanamo since 2002 , and developments in the middle east and afghanistan , where berlin has a major peacekeeping contingent . steinmeier said there were " no further decisions " on kurnaz after his talks with rice , but said he would stay in close contact with washington over the case . they also addressed last month 's landmark us-indian nuclear deal in which the united states agreed to provide nuclear technology in exchange for india separating its civil and military atomic programs and agreeing to inspections . steinmeier earlier renewed his criticism that the timing of the accord was " not helpful " in light of the iranian nuclear dispute , but said germany could come to support it if it were the " start of a process " that eventually integrated india into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which it has refused to sign . the german diplomat left washington late tuesday on a flight back to berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier in washington discusses iran german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on an official two day visit to the us , ahead of a trip to washington by german chancellor angela merkel scheduled for may .

at least nine police officers were slightly injured . more serious incidents broke out in lille , in the north , where hundreds of young people hurled missiles at the riot police , smashed shop windows and vandalized cars , although the situation calmed down in the evening .
a television reporter was assaulted while filming the violence and a young man suffered burn injuries from the shell of a tear gas grenade . police in rennes , in the northwest , also fired teargas at protestors after they were targeted with bottles and stones as people set garbage cans on fire and smashed bus shelters and windows .
firefighters said they had evacuated at least three people , including one hit with a rubber bullet . tuesday 's marches , accompanied by strikes , came despite concessions wrung from president jacques chirac as well as the prospect of imminent talks to end the two-month crisis over the first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- . french unions estimate three million protest participants the cgt union said three million people took part in nearly 200 rallies - roughly the same number it claimed had turned out on the last day of action a week ago .
the government figure was just over one million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a student banner : " we are not rioters , being jobless is our future " tens of thousands of students and workers marched to the place de l 'italie in the south of paris .
" we have to keep up the fight .
my parents did may 1968 , so they 're hardly going to stop me ! " said 19-year-old student elodie desrues , referring to the landmark student revolts . " it is obvious the government is on the retreat so we have to keep pushing to the end , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . union leaders vowed they would attend talks wednesday with ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , but only to push for the cpe 's complete abrogation . " if there is a chance to convince ump deputies that they are at a dead end , we shall go and once again ask for the withdrawal of the cpe .
but we refuse to negotiate mere adjustments , " the cgt 's bernard thibault said . the french must search deeper for major change in addition to the escalating protests , prime minister villepin 's botched attempt to reform labor laws has also caused anguished soul-searching about the survival of france 's social model against globalization . conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . opponents accuse the premier of trampling on hard-won labor rights and of railroading it through parliament without proper consultation with unions and employers . chirac offered an elaborate compromise last friday - ratifying the cpe - but immediately suspending it pending a new law to amend its most hotly contested provisions . but leaders of the student-union alliance were confident that more can be won , and want all trace of the hated contract written out of the new law . many believe villepin should resign in a sign of a shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , interior minister and ump chief nicolas sarkozy . an opinion poll to be published this week in l 'express magazine shows that 45 percent of the public think villepin should resign . tuesday 's protests were accompanied by strikes in the transport sector , but disruption was limited , with all paris metro trains running and 70 percent of tgv fast trains .
scores of domestic and european flights were cancelled because of action by air-traffic controllers . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

" it is of course very regrettable that this case has now occurred in a stock of domestic fowl , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" it is a serious situation , and we must now see , above all , if we can find out more about the path of infection , because saxony was not known until now as a state in which bird flu had occurred in migratory birds and that raises a lot of questions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been three cases of bird flu in europe since february a high death rate among turkeys at the farm alerted authorities to the danger , according to germany 's friedrich loeffler institute for animal health . all protective measures started " even though we have not found a case of the h5n1 virus in saxony among wild birds , it does not necessarily mean that wild birds in saxony are not infected , " fli spokesperson elke reinking said . state veterinarian ingolf herold said the animals were regularly checked for bird flu and did not show any signs of the virus or virus anti-bodies during tests two weeks ago . the state social ministry announced that a crisis group had been formed to deal with the new case .
state veterinarians are observing a 10-km area surrounding the poultry farm and police are inspecting vehicles that enter and leave the area while disinfectant mats are places on roads . " all measures possible in the short amount of time we 've had have already been put into motion , " state social minister helma orosz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts hope to know by thursday if the virus is the deadly asian strain testing measures help uncover infections the care taken during animal testing is one of the reasons the case was discovered , according to leipzig university 's maria krautwald-junghanns . " not a lack of hygiene , but the tight net of care and protection measures lead to these kinds of finds , " she added . since the middle of february 3,365 dead birds have been checked for bird flu .
until now the results had always been negative , according to the ministry .
officials expect to know on thursday if the virus was the aggressive asian form responsible for over 100 deaths . the h5n1 strain has been found in wild birds in seven of germany 's states , stretching from the baltic sea to lake constance , and reached berlin late last month when a dead buzzard found on the balcony of an apartment block in the capital was confirmed to have had the virus . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves more aid to farmers hit by bird flu the european commission cleared the way wednesday to release more eu aid to farmers hit by a slump in poultry consumption due to recent outbreaks of bird flu across europe .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

after being held hostage with six others for 74 days , the german government negotiated for her release .
weigel was flown from the jungle hide-out to the capital bogota in a helicopter .
upon her return , she received a bill for over 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- from the german foreign ministry - for its share of the expenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhilt weigel , returning to her home in bremen in 2003 the ministry had based its demands on german consular law , which states that if the government helps germans in financial need or danger abroad , it can reclaim the costs afterwards .
but weigel 's lawyer , josef mayer , argued that the law did not apply to hostages . " the fundamental decision that was made today makes it clear , that - at least by current law - the foreign ministry can only demand reimbursement in cases where german citizens are in financial distress , " mayer said .
" for example , if a citizen is abroad and their return airplane ticket is stolen , then the german foreign ministry is required to replace it for them .
the same holds true for hostages , and if the ministry gives them money for their return flight , then they must repay these costs as well . " since reinhilt weigel paid for her own flight home , mayer argued , she should not be required to pay for the additional costs of her liberation .

ruiz , one of uruguay 's coaching stars , has a reputation as a polite , refined coach , which keeps him in good standing with the paraguayan media and public . dw-world.de : what can be said about the paraguay team based on its world cup preparations ? anibal ruiz : i think our preparations up to the moment have been good .
we have taken care of the logistics for our participation in the world cup , we 're visiting all the national team players , observing what our opponents are doing and keeping up with how our injured players are healing , as is the case with roque santa cruz . you were named south america 's 2005 coach of the year .
was that recognition for the development of soccer in paraguay ? yes , of course .
paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .
that is what i call a process . in paraguay we have managed what all other countries find very difficult : a generation breakthrough .
the teams that tried it did n't qualify for the world cup , but we did it smoothly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney , right , and david beckham will be difficult opponents what is paraguay 's plan for the world cup ? paraguay has to do better in 2006 than in 2002 and 1998 .
we know how difficult our group is : sweden , england , and trinidad and tobago are not easy opponents . we want to be a main player in germany and to do that we 're going to have to rely on our expertise , and our skills and prove why our players can play in the best leagues in italy , spain , germany , mexico and brazil .
we do n't just want to be participants in germany but protagonists . what is your evaluation of your opponents ? there are no easy opponents at the world cup .
the 32 best teams take part and the path to the final is full of hurdles .
we 're actually going to be playing against three european teams . under leo beenhakker 's instruction , trinidad and tobago play a very " dutch " game .
paraguay is not going to have a problem with that , we realize and respect that the next opponent is always the most difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roque santa cruz should be back in shape for the world cup where are paraguay 's strengths ? the best player on our team is the team itself .
rationality and structure are essential , with them we 'll be able to do it .
paraguay wo n't be an easy opponent for anyone . what can paraguay still improve ? quite a bit .
we have to work on new alternatives to make sure our opponents do n't know us by heart . will these alternatives change depending on the opponent ? they will have to . what does the world cup mean for you ? every coach dreams of being there .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest event , and it 's where you learn a lot and can test your skills and knowledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruiz may be dreaming of the trophy , but he is n't telling anyone about it how far do you realistically think paraguay will make it ? our idea is to move on step by step .
getting through the first round is the first step . so you do n't have any dreams or goals ?
no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .
we still want to show new things , a more beautiful game .
we have a solid house , now we 're putting in the beautiful furniture . daniel martínez interviewed anibal ruiz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interviews with the stars read dw-world.de 's other interviews with the coaches and players in the 2006 world cup .

some hospital administrators said cutting personnel may be their only option . every day , some 6,000 doctors in 23 cities across germany trade their stethoscopes and scalpels for whistles and signs , and the hospitals where they work lose between 250,000 euros and 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 245,000 and $ 735,000 -rrb- , according to the german hospital association 's andreas priefler .

" the strikes will continue for as long as employers insist on additional income cuts , " he said at a demonstration tuesday in ulm . an effect montgomery has hoped to avoid has , however , now been put forth by some hospital administrators .
they have made it clear that revenue losses caused by the strikes could result in personnel reductions . " we have to seriously consider if we want to continue employing so many young people , " jörg tarnow , head of the düsseldorf clinic said .
" since more than 70 percent of our budget goes to personnel costs , it is clear where the savings measures will have to focus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the strikes , some doctors may be washing windows for a living a hospital in erlangen , where operations have dropped by 20 percent , has gone 2.6 million euros into the red due to the strikes , hospital spokesman johannes eissing told the associated press .
he said the losses were equal to 54 jobs . eissing said other means of recovering the missing funds were being considered , and added that the hospital would n't be able to make any decisions until the striks are over and it 's clear how many patients come back . no end to strikes in sight for the moment the unions do not seem fazed by the hospitals ' potential plans . " this is a normal employer reaction , " verdi 's martin körbel-landwehr said .
" we are not going to be scared away by this threat . " but since the negotiators are n't even at the bargaining table , the marburger bund seems to be assuming that there wo n't be a deal soon .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .
just a few weeks later , germany 's chancellor at the time , gerhard schröder , visited moammar gadhafi in a traditional bedouin tent outside of tripoli .
britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is extremely rich in oil libya is one of germany 's strongest trading partners in northern africa .
last year , germany exported goods to libya worth 657.7 million euros -lrb- $ 805.7 million -rrb- , according to the german federal statistics office . " the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .

britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent .

" the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .

macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?

neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .

paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.04.2006 blowing the whistle on corruption in sport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " early warning system " for referees at risk ?
the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

" despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

at least nine police officers were slightly injured . more serious incidents broke out in lille , in the north , where hundreds of young people hurled missiles at the riot police , smashed shop windows and vandalized cars , although the situation calmed down in the evening .
a television reporter was assaulted while filming the violence and a young man suffered burn injuries from the shell of a tear gas grenade . police in rennes , in the northwest , also fired teargas at protestors after they were targeted with bottles and stones as people set garbage cans on fire and smashed bus shelters and windows .
firefighters said they had evacuated at least three people , including one hit with a rubber bullet . tuesday 's marches , accompanied by strikes , came despite concessions wrung from president jacques chirac as well as the prospect of imminent talks to end the two-month crisis over the first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- . french unions estimate three million protest participants the cgt union said three million people took part in nearly 200 rallies - roughly the same number it claimed had turned out on the last day of action a week ago .
the government figure was just over one million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a student banner : " we are not rioters , being jobless is our future " tens of thousands of students and workers marched to the place de l 'italie in the south of paris .
" we have to keep up the fight .
my parents did may 1968 , so they 're hardly going to stop me ! " said 19-year-old student elodie desrues , referring to the landmark student revolts . " it is obvious the government is on the retreat so we have to keep pushing to the end , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . union leaders vowed they would attend talks wednesday with ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , but only to push for the cpe 's complete abrogation . " if there is a chance to convince ump deputies that they are at a dead end , we shall go and once again ask for the withdrawal of the cpe .
but we refuse to negotiate mere adjustments , " the cgt 's bernard thibault said . the french must search deeper for major change in addition to the escalating protests , prime minister villepin 's botched attempt to reform labor laws has also caused anguished soul-searching about the survival of france 's social model against globalization . conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . opponents accuse the premier of trampling on hard-won labor rights and of railroading it through parliament without proper consultation with unions and employers . chirac offered an elaborate compromise last friday - ratifying the cpe - but immediately suspending it pending a new law to amend its most hotly contested provisions . but leaders of the student-union alliance were confident that more can be won , and want all trace of the hated contract written out of the new law . many believe villepin should resign in a sign of a shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , interior minister and ump chief nicolas sarkozy . an opinion poll to be published this week in l 'express magazine shows that 45 percent of the public think villepin should resign . tuesday 's protests were accompanied by strikes in the transport sector , but disruption was limited , with all paris metro trains running and 70 percent of tgv fast trains .
scores of domestic and european flights were cancelled because of action by air-traffic controllers . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .
just a few weeks later , germany 's chancellor at the time , gerhard schröder , visited moammar gadhafi in a traditional bedouin tent outside of tripoli .
britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is extremely rich in oil libya is one of germany 's strongest trading partners in northern africa .
last year , germany exported goods to libya worth 657.7 million euros -lrb- $ 805.7 million -rrb- , according to the german federal statistics office . " the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .
it will be the first high-level visit by a dutch official since gadhafi took power in 1969 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new german-libyan beginning german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi have agreed to expand political and business ties between their countries after their second meeting in tripoli .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?
visitors say no .
" it is just great art , pure and simple , " said student andreas meissner , who visited the show .
besides , before coming to berlin , " melancholy " drew over 300,000 people during its three-month run at the grand palais in paris .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .
things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian cleric abu omar was allegedly kidnapped by the cia in milan in 2003 amnesty international secretary general irene khan said the reports " shows how the -lrb- us -rrb- administration is manipulating commercial arrangements in order to be able to transfer people in violation of international law . " khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

after being held hostage with six others for 74 days , the german government negotiated for her release .
weigel was flown from the jungle hide-out to the capital bogota in a helicopter .

" the fundamental decision that was made today makes it clear , that - at least by current law - the foreign ministry can only demand reimbursement in cases where german citizens are in financial distress , " mayer said .
" for example , if a citizen is abroad and their return airplane ticket is stolen , then the german foreign ministry is required to replace it for them .
the same holds true for hostages , and if the ministry gives them money for their return flight , then they must repay these costs as well . " since reinhilt weigel paid for her own flight home , mayer argued , she should not be required to pay for the additional costs of her liberation .

twenty years later , relations between libya and europe have done an about-face . the berlin disco " la belle " was packed as usual on the night of april 5 , 1986 .
among its guests were many us soldiers , who were certainly not thinking of politics , the middle east or strained relations between the united states and libya . but reality caught up with them : a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night , killing two americans and a turkish woman .
over 200 people were injured . a berlin court ruled that libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing .
in 2001 , following a nearly four-year long trial , the judges convicted a libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years . the big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation .
already in the 1990s , tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the european union . financial reparation opened the door to europe in 2004 , the gaddafi international foundation for charity associations and the legal representatives of the german la belle victims settled on $ 35 million in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and gadhafi met in a traditional surrounding this opened the door to europe .

britain 's prime minister tony blair also paid gadhafi a visit . a few months earlier , in april 2004 , the european union had welcomed the libyan leader to brussels .
it was gadhafi 's first official visit to europe in 15 years . bernd westphal , the german ambassador to libya , said bilateral relations had been through difficult times . " the german embassy in tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between germany and libya , " westphal said .
" we want to build on our traditional friendship with libya and we want to strengthen the political , economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples . " business interests booming in libya in the past few years , libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the west .
european business representatives have been increasingly knocking on libya 's door . even the united states is showing increased interest in the northern african nation .
washington is pleased that libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction . libya 's ambassador to germany , said abdulaati , said political and economic relations between libya and germany were " excellent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya is extremely rich in oil libya is one of germany 's strongest trading partners in northern africa .

" the economy is the driving power in german-libyan relations , " said abdulaati in an interview with the arab-german association for trade and industry . but germany is n't the only european country making deals in libya .
france last month signed an accord with libya on peaceful nuclear research . " this accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons , " public works minister maatuk maatuk said at the signing ceremony in march .
" we are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . " this week , the netherlands ' economics minister laurens jan brinkhorst will visit libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .
in medieval times , scholars and artists formed " melancholy clubs " and in 1621 , briton robert burton wrote " anatomy of melancholy , " the first systematic research into the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 visited in its first five weeks since dürer 's work appeared in germany in the 16th century , no country has come to be so associated with melancholy through its literature , art and philosophy , particularly in the romantic period following the enlightenment which glorified the feeling .
" melancholy characterizes those with a superb sense of the sublime , " wrote german philosopher immanuel kant in his work " observations on the feelings of the beautiful and sublime " in 1764 .
according to his definition , sublime feelings arouse both enjoyment and dread . german writer heinrich heine took up the theme later in his famous poem , " die lorelei . "
" i do not know what haunts me , what saddened my mind all day , " he wrote . the thread continues into contemporary works by german artists such as jörg immendorf and sigmar polke who the exhibition organizers have labeled " the new melancholics , " and who bring the " intellectual attitude " into the new century .
germany 's dark side melancholy is also evident on a daily basis in the german media .
a survey last year found that depressive feelings in young germans under the age of 29 have doubled .
and campaigns to improve the nation 's spirits abound , with one recently spending 30 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- featuring celebrities urging germans to help their country by simply getting into a better mood .
bildunterschrift : american painter edward hopper shows that melancholy is not restricted to europe sociologists , historians and media commentators have offered all kinds of explanations for the less than peppy national mood .
some attribute it to a history of war throughout the nation 's fragmented history .
others blame protestantism , the nazi era , the souring of the economy or even germany 's gloomy climate with its long , gray winters . " there is a culture of pessimism in germany , " said jackson janes , executive director of the american institute for contemporary studies in washington , dc , who attributes it to the struggles for statehood in the 1800s combined with the terrible experiences in the first part of the 20th century .
" there is a sense that something can go wrong and they tend to look around for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show runs until may 7 but even if germans are more melancholic than their european neighbors or lack the sunny optimism of americans as clichés go , does that account for the snaking lines around the museum making " melancholy " the most popular exhibition since moma came to berlin two years ago ?

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ? a man sits surrounded by measuring instruments and various tools , hand on cheek , puzzling over the array .
this is albrecht dürer 's enigmatic genius in his " melencolia i , " who thirsts for knowledge and then is left estranged from mankind because of it .
and it is this work that is at the heart of a new exhibition at berlin 's new national gallery , that has drawn 100,000 visitors in its first five weeks since opening on feb .
17 .
it has become such a surprise hit that the museum was forced to extend its hours .
the exhibition " melancholy , genius and insanity in art " explores intellectual brooding and creative despair through more than 300 works of art by such icons as peter brueghel , edward hopper and caspar david friedrich .
and it tries to show that such suffering and alienation informs art across cultures and centuries . melancholy is sublime the term comes from the ancient greek melas -lrb- black -rrb- and chole -lrb- gall -rrb- .
the greeks believed that it was bile in the body that produced the despair and depression that so characterized the poets and artists of their time .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe . " bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .
-lrb- march 14 , 2006 -rrb- eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown . " amnesty said the aviation sector must also take steps to prevent renditions . " the onus is on -lrb- aviation -rrb- companies to ensure that they are aware of the end use of any aircraft they lease or operate and that they do not facilitate human rights violations , " amnesty said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition wins support for bnd affair inquiry germany 's three opposition factions have succeeded in garnering enough support from the bundestag to request an inquiry into berlin 's role in the us-led strike on iraq .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

" despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .
" in germany , but also in other countries , there is a long tradition in the lower leagues of paying money - not officially , but under the table , " schenk told dw-world .
" that ’ s not corruption per se , but it does show that you have a situation in the club in which corruption could develop . "
officials in small sports clubs , for example , do not attend to issues like proper tax declaration and documenting money flow , like how and when players or coaches are paid , schenk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referree robert hoyzer admitted to match-fixing the first step in combating corruption is for sports organizations to clearly state their intention to fight criminal manipulation .
" it sends out a signal to potential criminals and can prompt people who suspect corruption somewhere in the chain to report it , " said schenk .
" often , people are aware of something , but they are too scared to talk about it . " sports falls from grace people 's reluctance to shatter sports ' illusion of innocence often keeps them from reporting cases .
and , another aspect to consider : " the image of sports is very important , particularly to the sponsors , " schenk said .
" usually the sponsors are buying a good image when they support a particular sport .
take away the good image and you put funding at risk . " globally-active transparency international said knowledge about corruption in other sectors of society can help to identify problematic areas in sports .
it also said it wants to promote co-operation between sports federations to improve transparency . anti-corruption guidelines are essential by sports organizations working together , they can define rules about what is acceptable or not - like whether or not sports officials should accept gifts or invitations from sponsors , for example .
once guidelines have been established , all sports organizations should be required to adhere to them , schenk explained to dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where there 's smoke , there 's fire : sports corruption is international but just how widespread is corruption in sports ?
in germany , soccer leaders had hoped a scandal involving former referee robert hoyzer - who was convicted in 2005 for his bid to rig nine matches in a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- fraud deal - was singular .
they were wrong .
prosecuting attorneys in frankfurt and cologne , among other cities , are investigating new reports of game manipulation . corruption is not limited to germany either .
schenk said there are plenty of cases of betting manipulation in belgium , and the scandal over the way the 2002 winter olympic games were awarded to salt lake city shows how necessary reform of the international olympic committee was .
" corruption is not just a german issue , but an international one , " said schenk . code of ethics to fight corruption germany , however , may be one step closer to addressing the follies of the game .
the two main sports organizations - the german sports association and the national olympic committee - will merge in may of this year to form one new sports organization : the german olympic sports association .
transparency international-germany has just asked the new group to begin its work by laying down a code of ethics for athletes and sports clubs and by creating an " ethics commission " to address scandals and promote transparency . sports spectators , for their part , can show their dissatisfaction over athletes ' doping practices and match-fixing by boycotting games , schenk suggests . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial brings match-rigging back in focus german soccer was shamed when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing nine matches in 2004 .

after being held hostage with six others for 74 days , the german government negotiated for her release .
weigel was flown from the jungle hide-out to the capital bogota in a helicopter .

" the fundamental decision that was made today makes it clear , that - at least by current law - the foreign ministry can only demand reimbursement in cases where german citizens are in financial distress , " mayer said .
" for example , if a citizen is abroad and their return airplane ticket is stolen , then the german foreign ministry is required to replace it for them .

ruiz , one of uruguay 's coaching stars , has a reputation as a polite , refined coach , which keeps him in good standing with the paraguayan media and public . dw-world.de : what can be said about the paraguay team based on its world cup preparations ? anibal ruiz : i think our preparations up to the moment have been good .
we have taken care of the logistics for our participation in the world cup , we 're visiting all the national team players , observing what our opponents are doing and keeping up with how our injured players are healing , as is the case with roque santa cruz . you were named south america 's 2005 coach of the year .
was that recognition for the development of soccer in paraguay ? yes , of course .
paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .
that is what i call a process . in paraguay we have managed what all other countries find very difficult : a generation breakthrough .
the teams that tried it did n't qualify for the world cup , but we did it smoothly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney , right , and david beckham will be difficult opponents what is paraguay 's plan for the world cup ? paraguay has to do better in 2006 than in 2002 and 1998 .
we know how difficult our group is : sweden , england , and trinidad and tobago are not easy opponents . we want to be a main player in germany and to do that we 're going to have to rely on our expertise , and our skills and prove why our players can play in the best leagues in italy , spain , germany , mexico and brazil .
we do n't just want to be participants in germany but protagonists . what is your evaluation of your opponents ? there are no easy opponents at the world cup .
the 32 best teams take part and the path to the final is full of hurdles .
we 're actually going to be playing against three european teams . under leo beenhakker 's instruction , trinidad and tobago play a very " dutch " game .
paraguay is not going to have a problem with that , we realize and respect that the next opponent is always the most difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roque santa cruz should be back in shape for the world cup where are paraguay 's strengths ? the best player on our team is the team itself .
rationality and structure are essential , with them we 'll be able to do it .
paraguay wo n't be an easy opponent for anyone . what can paraguay still improve ? quite a bit .
we have to work on new alternatives to make sure our opponents do n't know us by heart . will these alternatives change depending on the opponent ? they will have to . what does the world cup mean for you ? every coach dreams of being there .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest event , and it 's where you learn a lot and can test your skills and knowledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruiz may be dreaming of the trophy , but he is n't telling anyone about it how far do you realistically think paraguay will make it ? our idea is to move on step by step .
getting through the first round is the first step . so you do n't have any dreams or goals ?
no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .
we still want to show new things , a more beautiful game .
we have a solid house , now we 're putting in the beautiful furniture . daniel martínez interviewed anibal ruiz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interviews with the stars read dw-world.de 's other interviews with the coaches and players in the 2006 world cup .

ruiz , one of uruguay 's coaching stars , has a reputation as a polite , refined coach , which keeps him in good standing with the paraguayan media and public . dw-world.de : what can be said about the paraguay team based on its world cup preparations ? anibal ruiz : i think our preparations up to the moment have been good .

" the cia has exploited aviation practices that would otherwise require their flights to be declared to aviation authorities , " according to a new report by the london-based human rights organization . amnesty said the report " exposes a covert operation whereby people have been arrested or abducted , transferred and held in secret or handed over to countries where they have faced torture and other ill-treatment . "
it described " how the cia has used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of ' rendition ' flights . " amnesty said it " has records of nearly 1,000 flights " by planes that appear to have been " permanently operated by the cia through front companies " and most of which used european airspace .
it also said " there are records of some 600 other flights made by planes confirmed as having been used at least temporarily by the cia . " in explaining how it obtained its information , amnesty cited interviews with people transferred illegally . amnesty : us manipulated commercial arrangements " one particular aircraft is known to have made over 100 stops in guantanamo bay , " it said .
" another took -lrb- terror suspect -rrb- abu omar to egypt from germany after he was kidnapped in italy , " amnesty said .
" its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the cia , but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency , " amnesty said .

" khan charged that the whole process surrounding the renditions has often been illegal right from the start . " the report shows not just how arrest and extradition procedures have been ignored , the ban on torture and other ill-treatment has been disregarded , but also how aviation practices have been undermined , " khan said .
onus on aviation sector with amnesty warning that governments may find themselves " complicit in serious human rights abuses , " it urged them to take steps to stop and prevent renditions .
governments must insist that any aircraft used for an intelligence mission be declared a " state " flight and prohibit the use of airspace and airports for " renditions " and actively investigate suspected " rendition " cases , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments and the aviation sector must take steps to prevent rendition , amnesty said it also urged them to disclose " the full extent of these practices and the fate of those whose whereabouts are still unknown .

dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has been caught by the wind of opposition coming from some european member states .
the current eu enlargement strategy regarding the western balkan states is increasingly being called into question .
but rehn does n't get tired of presenting a european perspective as the only path towards stabile and peaceful balkans . on the other side , eu council president and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , along with numerous german conservatives , prefer to point out the eu 's limited capacity for absorption .
some say that even bulgaria 's and romania 's entry into the union , set for 2008 at the latest , is difficult to digest . eleven years after the end of the war in bosnia and seven years after the kosovo war , the eu is still deeply distrustful of the balkan states .
the eu enlargement commissioner has acknowledged the good will and progress made by the balkan governments , but the problems of ethnically torn states such as bosnia and herzegovina or serbia-montenegro are considered to be enormous .
organized crime , human trafficking and corruption are the keywords in almost every discussion about the balkans in brussels . buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn there is no real enthusiasm in brussels for completing the project of european unification or for balkan states , from croatia to albania , joining the union .
neither the eu foreign ministers nor the commission are in a particular hurry .
olli rehn made it clear in his enlargement strategy - announced at the beginning of the year - that he would like to step on the brakes a bit .
he also said that the commission 's criteria and conditions should be scrupulously adhered to - also a way of buying extra time . the eu 's ongoing tug-of-war with the government in belgrade regarding the arrest of ratko mladic - an alleged war criminal who is wanted by the international war crimes tribunal at the hague - should be seen in this context .
for a year , the mladic case has been blocking the official start of stabilization and association talks with serbia-montenegro , which is a preliminary step on the way to accession talks . and even though the eu threatened it would break off negotiations with serbia unless mladic was arrested , rehn has yet again extended his ultimatum for another four weeks .
one could play this little game forever , especially with the still unknown whereabouts of bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic , another alleged war criminal , in the background . belgrade has the power to stop the tug-of-war by delivering the last remaining war criminals to the un tribunal .
on the other hand , the eu could also jump over its own shadow and take up negotiations with serbia ; that is , if belgrade 's membership really is close to its heart .
in the case of croatia , accession talks began in october 2005 even though general ante gotovina , also wanted for war crimes , had not yet been captured . the bigger picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is unwilling to let its impoverished province kosovo become independent the european union is having a particularly hard time with serbia-montenegro , nato 's opponent during the kosovo war .
bosnia and herzegovina has been participating in intensive stabilization and association talks since the beginning of the year , while albania has already completed the process .
macedonia has a candidate status , and croatia is already negotiating the concrete terms for its eu entry . the talks between the eu and serbia-montenegro , which started on wednesday , will not be substantial .
brussels would like to first wait and see how serbia-montenegro conducts itself in regard to finding a solution for the kosovo question .
will belgrade be ready to compromise and accept kosovo 's far-reaching independence , which is what most europeans see as inevitable ?
or will belgrade block it ?
it has yet to be seen what will actually happen to the serbian-montenegrin federation .
montenegrins will vote on independence in a referendum in may . enlargement commissioner rehn is right to warn about the dangers of being too focused on symbolic dates and negotiations .
neither serbia 's national honor nor europe 's credibility would depend on them .
for the balkan states it 's much more important to learn to cooperate better and more openly , in a european spirit .
national reconciliation and a free-trade zone in the balkans are long overdue .
olli rehn , in his quiet way , described the task for the balkans by paraphrasing a famous kennedy quote : " do n't ask what europe can do for you ; ask what you can do for yourselves and europe .

after being held hostage with six others for 74 days , the german government negotiated for her release .
weigel was flown from the jungle hide-out to the capital bogota in a helicopter .
upon her return , she received a bill for over 12,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- from the german foreign ministry - for its share of the expenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhilt weigel , returning to her home in bremen in 2003 the ministry had based its demands on german consular law , which states that if the government helps germans in financial need or danger abroad , it can reclaim the costs afterwards .
but weigel 's lawyer , josef mayer , argued that the law did not apply to hostages . " the fundamental decision that was made today makes it clear , that - at least by current law - the foreign ministry can only demand reimbursement in cases where german citizens are in financial distress , " mayer said .
" for example , if a citizen is abroad and their return airplane ticket is stolen , then the german foreign ministry is required to replace it for them .
the same holds true for hostages , and if the ministry gives them money for their return flight , then they must repay these costs as well . " since reinhilt weigel paid for her own flight home , mayer argued , she should not be required to pay for the additional costs of her liberation .

ruiz , one of uruguay 's coaching stars , has a reputation as a polite , refined coach , which keeps him in good standing with the paraguayan media and public . dw-world.de : what can be said about the paraguay team based on its world cup preparations ? anibal ruiz : i think our preparations up to the moment have been good .
we have taken care of the logistics for our participation in the world cup , we 're visiting all the national team players , observing what our opponents are doing and keeping up with how our injured players are healing , as is the case with roque santa cruz . you were named south america 's 2005 coach of the year .
was that recognition for the development of soccer in paraguay ? yes , of course .
paraguayan soccer has presented itself very well on the international stage over the past few years : participating in the world cup three times in a row , a very finish at the olympics in athens , good presentations at the u-17 and u-20 world cups .
all of this is no accident - it 's the result of conscience work with young talent .
in the current national team we have 50 percent of the players who were in the olympics .
many of them have been training with me since their time on the u-20 side .
that is what i call a process . in paraguay we have managed what all other countries find very difficult : a generation breakthrough .
the teams that tried it did n't qualify for the world cup , but we did it smoothly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney , right , and david beckham will be difficult opponents what is paraguay 's plan for the world cup ? paraguay has to do better in 2006 than in 2002 and 1998 .
we know how difficult our group is : sweden , england , and trinidad and tobago are not easy opponents . we want to be a main player in germany and to do that we 're going to have to rely on our expertise , and our skills and prove why our players can play in the best leagues in italy , spain , germany , mexico and brazil .
we do n't just want to be participants in germany but protagonists . what is your evaluation of your opponents ? there are no easy opponents at the world cup .
the 32 best teams take part and the path to the final is full of hurdles .
we 're actually going to be playing against three european teams . under leo beenhakker 's instruction , trinidad and tobago play a very " dutch " game .
paraguay is not going to have a problem with that , we realize and respect that the next opponent is always the most difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roque santa cruz should be back in shape for the world cup where are paraguay 's strengths ? the best player on our team is the team itself .
rationality and structure are essential , with them we 'll be able to do it .
paraguay wo n't be an easy opponent for anyone . what can paraguay still improve ? quite a bit .
we have to work on new alternatives to make sure our opponents do n't know us by heart . will these alternatives change depending on the opponent ? they will have to . what does the world cup mean for you ? every coach dreams of being there .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest event , and it 's where you learn a lot and can test your skills and knowledge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruiz may be dreaming of the trophy , but he is n't telling anyone about it how far do you realistically think paraguay will make it ? our idea is to move on step by step .
getting through the first round is the first step . so you do n't have any dreams or goals ?
no expectations ? dreams should n't be shared , they should be realized . what is your impression of the job germany has done hosting the tournament ? amazing !
everything we have seen is wonderful .
the germans are very warm and willing to help .
you notice that they want their guests to feel at home . is it an advantage that three of paraguay 's most important members play in the bundesliga ? having players that are known to the country and know the country is a good starting point .
it 's not an advantage since all the teams have players in the world 's best leagues - in germany and other places . will paraguay be satisfied with the team 's results ? yes .
we still want to show new things , a more beautiful game .

the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany . sports is no longer just about enjoying the game .
transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said . " despite the number of individual cases recently there has been far too little public discussion of corruption in sport , " said hansjoerg elshorst , chairman of transparency international-germany , at a recent news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the good image of sports is essential " the agency is urging sports officials to be more vigilant , particularly ahead of the june 9-july 9 world cup . corruption is not a one-time occurrence rather than singling out individual cases , transparency international-germany ’ s new anti-corruption group hopes to survey sports clubs and associations to gain a broader picture of how sports corruption functions . corruption can start on a very basic level .

transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- in berlin said the risk of corruption in sports - particularly soccer - has increased dramatically as commercial influences grow . dw-world.de spoke to sylvia schenk , a lawyer , former professional athlete and member of the new working group transparency international-germany has set up to combat corruption .
" sports is a big economic area .
and just like in other sectors of society , sports is vulnerable to corruption .
it ’ s not a holy realm , " said schenk . the betting scandals that have plagued german soccer over the past year , for instance , showed the susceptibility of the sport to criminal manipulation , she said .

the duo , well-known for hosting shows such as saturday night takeaway and i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here , play two men who recreate footage of a post- mortem carried out on an alien and convince the world it is genuine .
alien autopsy is based on the true story of ray santilli and gary shoefield , who claimed their 1995 film shed new light on the roswell ufo crash site , sparking a storm of interest .
" we could n't believe this great story .
when we read the script we thought it was the one for us , " says donnelly .
" we 'd been offered films in the past , but none of them came up to the mark . "
the pair had to screen test for the roles in tv director jonny campbell 's debut feature film .
darker side having to go through the audition process made the tv stars warm to their first major film project .
" it made us think it was n't just an ant and dec vehicle - they were going to make it whether it was with us or not , " says donnelly .
mcpartlin and donnelly have been cast against their usual small screen roles in the film , with ant transformed from a wisecracking buffoon into the serious , bespectacled gary , while dec is the rougher-edged , louder ray .
the pair had to be convinced that such a role reversal would prove a success .
" we instinctively thought we would play the opposite parts , but the writer and director said they would prefer it the other way round .
now i 've seen the finished product , i could n't imagine it the other way " , says mcpartlin .
the film , containing gore , bad language and some dark undertones , is a stylistic break for the pair and may require their fanbase to make some adjustments .
' one-off ' " i just hope they go and see it , " says mcpartlin .
" i hope it 's well-received . "
" it 's not too dissimilar tone-wise to what we usually do on tv .
but there 's also a slightly serious edge to it . "
ant and dec 's tv break came with roles in bbc children 's drama byker grove .
they enjoyed a brief musical career before presenting became their stock-in-trade - making a return to acting a shift in gear .
" it took a while to change from our saturday night presenting head back to our acting head , but it was all down to jonny campbell .
" we found the more real we could make the performance , the funnier it would be , " says mcpartlin .
but the pair are not about to turn their backs on their extensive work on the small screen in favour of a film career .
" it 's certainly a one-off at the moment .
we have a lot of television commitments , " says donnelly , with the pair signed to itv until the end of 2007 .
" we want to see how people react to us doing it .
we 're certainly not going to launch an assault on tinseltown .
this might be the only film we ever make , so we 're going to enjoy it . "
the pair add that they are looking forward to promoting the film overseas , where they will be free of their uk celebrity .
" it 'll be interesting for us to be seen as just two actors .
we 're not taking it for granted that we 'll be known , " says mcpartlin .
alien autopsy is released in the uk on friday .

" it made us think it was n't just an ant and dec vehicle - they were going to make it whether it was with us or not , " says donnelly .
mcpartlin and donnelly have been cast against their usual small screen roles in the film , with ant transformed from a wisecracking buffoon into the serious , bespectacled gary , while dec is the rougher-edged , louder ray .
the ' alien ' is a modified dummy with raw meat for innards the pair had to be convinced that such a role reversal would prove a success .
" we instinctively thought we would play the opposite parts , but the writer and director said they would prefer it the other way round .
now i 've seen the finished product , i could n't imagine it the other way " , says mcpartlin .
the film , containing gore , bad language and some dark undertones , is a stylistic break for the pair and may require their fanbase to make some adjustments .
' one-off ' " i just hope they go and see it , " says mcpartlin .
" i hope it 's well-received . "
" it 's not too dissimilar tone-wise to what we usually do on tv .
but there 's also a slightly serious edge to it . "
ant and dec 's tv break came with roles in bbc children 's drama byker grove .
they enjoyed a brief musical career before presenting became their stock-in-trade - making a return to acting a shift in gear .
" it took a while to change from our saturday night presenting head back to our acting head , but it was all down to jonny campbell .
" we found the more real we could make the performance , the funnier it would be , " says mcpartlin .
comic jimmy carr is among the film 's supporting cast but the pair are not about to turn their backs on their extensive work on the small screen in favour of a film career .
" it 's certainly a one-off at the moment .
we have a lot of television commitments , " says donnelly , with the pair signed to itv until the end of 2007 .
" we want to see how people react to us doing it .
we 're certainly not going to launch an assault on tinseltown .
this might be the only film we ever make , so we 're going to enjoy it . "
the pair add that they are looking forward to promoting the film overseas , where they will be free of their uk celebrity .
" it 'll be interesting for us to be seen as just two actors .
we 're not taking it for granted that we 'll be known , " says mcpartlin .
alien autopsy is released in the uk on friday .

councils in north-east england have already paid about £ 100m while in scotland pay-outs could reach £ 560m , reported income data services -lrb- ids -rrb- .
other councils had " larger workforces and therefore larger equal pay liabilities " , the research group said .
ids said pay-outs had been made to women denied access to bonuses that could add up to 80 % to basic pay .
' equal value ' sally brett , of ids , said : " women working as school caterers or home helps are doing jobs of equal value to men , working in refuse collection , gardening or maintenance , and have been on the same pay grade as them for many years , but they have been denied access to the regular bonus payments that the men have received . "
ids said local authorities were struggling to implement new equality-proofed pay and grading structures without additional government funding similar to that given to other parts of the public sector like the nhs .
" councils across britain , many with larger workforces and therefore larger equal pay liabilities than the scottish and north-east councils , have the same legacy issues to deal with , " said ms brett .
the women 's campaigns have been backed by the gmb and unison unions in the past and ids said no-win , no-fee lawyers were seeking to represent workers with " such transparent equal pay claims " .
" we could soon see the bill for back pay compensation in local government reaching into the billions , " said ms brett .

whistleblower : estate agents during the eight month investigation undercover reporters anna adams and emma clarke found agents putting forward false offers , faking landlords ' signatures and falsifying documents to inflate property prices .
the reporters spent three months working in multi-million pound agency foxtons .
the programme investigated four other agencies in london some with even more shocking results .
following its broadcast , mps have called for a debate in parliament on the issues the programme brought to their attention .
liberal democrat richard younger-ross mp , has asked the home secretary why the police are not investigating the bbc 's findings .
" if agents are over-inflating prices through fraudulent valuations and similar practices , " he says , " then there may be need for police action and further regulation of the industry in general . "
elderly victim renewed calls for the industry to be better regulated have also been seized upon by other estate agents keen to distance themselves from the murky practices exposed in the programme .
some rival firms have now reportedly said they would think twice about employing any agents who have worked in foxtons .
i have been naive in trusting the agent and was staggered when i realised how much money i could have lost elderly homeowner anna also worked at a smaller firm , time2move , based in south london and found agents lying to vendors and boasting about flyboarding .
whistleblower has been inundated with demands from hundreds of viewers , calling for tighter guidelines for buyers and sellers after they watched the shocking tactics used by unscrupulous agents .
in one of the programme 's most shocking scenes the manager of the fulham branch of london-based chard asked for a £ 10,000 cash-backhander to cheat an elderly homeowner out of £ 50,000 .
the homeowner involved has thanked whistleblower .
he added : " i have been naive in trusting the agent and was staggered when i realised how much money i could have lost .
" i did n't know about the lack of regulation until i watched the show . "
he said chard had been in touch with him and expressed its " deepest regret " and promised to sell his flat for a fair price .
' deep mistrust ' the home office are now investigating the fake passport that was sold to our reporter by an estate agent from prime time mortgage and property services .
prime time in tottenham , north london , has since closed .
anna adams said : " the response to the programme has been unbelievable .
we have been inundated with emails and letters from hundreds of consumers desperate to tell their horror stories at the hands of various estate agents .
" and i have been stopped in the street by total strangers keen to thank me for exposing one of the britain 's most despised industries .
" there are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the uk and not all of them use practices as murky as the ones i came across .
" people love to hate estate agents and have a deep mistrust of the industry , but estate agency does not have to be viewed with such contempt .
" it is perfectly easy to do the job without lying and cheating .
when i was at foxtons i was a very successful negotiator and managed to sell properties without resorting to any dirty tricks .
" but during the eight month investigation i discovered - among the various different agencies i investigated - a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
" and there seem to be few laws to prevent the manipulation and lies that i witnessed . "
all the agencies featured said they would take the allegations made very seriously and investigate .
in some of the agencies the people featured had already left the companies or had subsequently been suspended in response to the programme .

an application by uk coal to mine one million tonnes of coal from the site near shipley country park was rejected in 2004 .
but a public inquiry into derbyshire county council 's decision to turn down the proposal will start in a few weeks .
uk coal said noise and traffic restrictions will be imposed if their project is approved .
jackie sawyer , secretary of the west hallam environmental group , said : " we will be saying why we do n't want open cast mining in the area - we are urging local people to make their voices heard . "
it really seems like they are rubbing salt in wounds , coming back and doing it again jackie sawyer the mine is located about 650m from mapperley village and near shipley country park , which is used by more than 500,000 visitors a year including ramblers , fishermen and cyclists .
" we need to send a strong message to uk coal that ' no ' means ' no ' - we have had 65 years of this and i think we have done our bit .
" it really seems like they are rubbing salt in wounds , coming back and doing it again . "
residents who oppose the plans will hold a guided walk of the area near the proposed site on 9 april .
uk coal said : " at present customers are having to import more of their coal because of a lack of approvals for sites like lodge house - so in essence we are exporting jobs .
" if this appeal is successful , there will be a wide ranging list of conditions which would apply .
the firm said it will form a liaison committee with local residents to ensure that " not only those conditions were complied with but to ensure that we work together and be a good neighbour in the community while the site is operational " .

the rioting was sparked by the arrest of a black man the rioting which began in brixton , in the south london borough of lambeth , in april 1981 shocked the nation .
for three days , rioters - predominately young , black men - fought police , attacked buildings and set fire to vehicles .
more than 300 people were injured and the damage caused came to an estimated value of £ 7.5m.
what was most shocking to many people was the unexpectedness of events .
on the surface it seemed that black people were well-integrated into the fabric of uk society .
many were second generation , born to parents who had come to britain from the caribbean in the late 1940s and 1950s to help " the motherland " with post-war rebuilding .
have your say crime is still as much of an issue as it was 25 years ago in brixton kgbeep london , join the debate and there were high-profile success stories among britain 's black community .
trevor mcdonald had been presenting the news on television since 1973 , lenny henry was a popular comedian having won a tv talent show aged 17 in 1975 and daley thompson had won decathlon gold at the 1980 moscow olympics .
' sus ' law but below the surface tensions had been building up and on 11 april 1981 they boiled over in brixton , an area where 25 % of residents were from an ethnic minority group .
the days of full employment were long gone and in brixton around half of young black men had no job .
more than 100 officers were injured during the clashes an amended race relations act had become law in 1976 but police forces were granted an exemption from its conditions .
many young black men believed officers discriminated against them , particularly by use of the ' sus ' law under which anybody could be stopped and searched if officers merely suspected they might be planning to carry out a crime .
in early april , operation swamp - an attempt to cut street crime in brixton which used the sus law to stop more than 1,000 people in six days - heightened tensions .
unsubstantiated rumours of police brutality against a black man later led an angry crowd gathering to confront officers on the evening of 10 april for a few hours before the disturbances were contained .
but an arrest the following night sparked off the rioting in earnest .
but although its immediate causes were specific to brixton , the rioting was perhaps a sign of the times .
the mixture of high unemployment , deprivation , racial tensions and poor relations with police were not unique to brixton .
by the time lord scarman 's report on the events in brixton was published in november 1981 , similar disturbances had taken place in a raft of other english cities , most notably liverpool and manchester .
task force in his report lord scarman said there was " no doubt racial disadvantage was a fact of current british life " .
but he concluded that " institutional racism " did not exist in the metropolitan force .
eighteen years later lord macpherson would famously come to the opposite conclusion in his report following the killing of black teenager stephen lawrence .
lord scarman said the police were not " institutionally racist " lord scarman recommended " racially prejudiced " behaviour should be made a specific offence under the police discipline code with offenders liable to dismissal .
his report led to an end to the sus law , the creation of the police complaints authority and police / community consultative groups as well as new approaches to police recruitment and training .
but it would be another 20 years before the police came under the scope of the race relations act with a duty to implement racially-sensitive policies .
and after the trouble spread to toxteth in liverpool in july the government announced the creation of an inner city task force with a £ 90m budget to spend nationwide .
political progress as well as the political fallout on a national scale , events in brixton added impetus to black people becoming politically active , first on a local and then on a national level .
in 1985 bernie grant became the first ethnic minority leader of a london council -lrb- haringey -rrb- and two years later was one of the first four people from an ethnic minority to be elected to parliament -lrb- as mp for tottenham -rrb- in modern times .
increased black political participation followed the riots the riots also helped crystallise plans by entrepreneur val mccalla to start a newspaper aimed at the black british community .
the voice , launched at the notting hill carnival in 1982 , quickly became a financial success largely due to job adverts by london boroughs which wanted to increase their diversity .
by the mid-1990s the voice 's influence in black british society was such that the then-metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon accused it of sparking a race riot in brixton over its reporting of the death of a young black man in police custody .
deprived area but the financial success of the voice was not duplicated by many other black-run businesses .
in spite of initiatives such as the inner city task force and subsequently city action teams and the new deal , the " buppies " - young , upwardly mobile black people - of the 1980s were largely a passing phenomenon .
major race riots returned to the uk during the summer of 2001 since 1981 there has continued to be sporadic outbreaks of public disorder both in brixton and other major cities , most memorably in the north of england when white and asian youths clashed during the summer of 2001 .
eradicating the underlying social problems which are at the heart of many of the disturbances has swiftly climbed up the political agenda .
the labour government set up the social exclusion unit to tackle issues such as poverty and unemployment after its election victory in 1997 .
at the time of the 2001 census , nearly 40 % of lambeth residents were of ethnic minority origin .
and although pockets of brixton have gone upmarket , mainly due to an influx of city workers attracted by the area 's central location , in 2004 the london borough of lambeth was ranked the 23rd most deprived out of 354 english local authorities .
reports since the social exclusion unit was created have shown significant progress in some areas , such as reducing the number of children living in poverty and the number of people who sleep rough .
but other problems , such as the low academic achievement of boys of african caribbean and bangladeshi origin have proved harder to overcome .
and in spite of a government drive to bring more people into work , unemployment among ethnic minority communities is still twice the general rate .
the battle for brixton , an eyewitness account of the 1981 brixton riots told by rioters , police and local residents was broadcast on monday 10 april on bbc two at 1900 bst .

the rioting was sparked by the arrest of a black man the rioting which began in brixton , in the south london borough of lambeth , in april 1981 shocked the nation .
for three days , rioters - predominately young , black men - fought police , attacked buildings and set fire to vehicles .
more than 300 people were injured and the damage caused came to an estimated value of £ 7.5m.
what was most shocking to many people was the unexpectedness of events .
on the surface it seemed that black people were well-integrated into the fabric of uk society .
many were second generation , born to parents who had come to britain from the caribbean in the late 1940s and 1950s to help " the motherland " with post-war rebuilding .

trevor mcdonald had been presenting the news on television since 1973 , lenny henry was a popular comedian having won a tv talent show aged 17 in 1975 and daley thompson had won decathlon gold at the 1980 moscow olympics .
' sus ' law but below the surface tensions had been building up and on 11 april 1981 they boiled over in brixton , an area where 25 % of residents were from an ethnic minority group .
the days of full employment were long gone and in brixton around half of young black men had no job .
more than 100 officers were injured during the clashes an amended race relations act had become law in 1976 but police forces were granted an exemption from its conditions .
many young black men believed officers discriminated against them , particularly by use of the ' sus ' law under which anybody could be stopped and searched if officers merely suspected they might be planning to carry out a crime .
in early april , operation swamp - an attempt to cut street crime in brixton which used the sus law to stop more than 1,000 people in six days - heightened tensions .
unsubstantiated rumours of police brutality against a black man later led an angry crowd gathering to confront officers on the evening of 10 april for a few hours before the disturbances were contained .
but an arrest the following night sparked off the rioting in earnest .
but although its immediate causes were specific to brixton , the rioting was perhaps a sign of the times .
the mixture of high unemployment , deprivation , racial tensions and poor relations with police were not unique to brixton .
by the time lord scarman 's report on the events in brixton was published in november 1981 , similar disturbances had taken place in a raft of other english cities , most notably liverpool and manchester .
task force in his report lord scarman said there was " no doubt racial disadvantage was a fact of current british life " .
but he concluded that " institutional racism " did not exist in the metropolitan force .
eighteen years later lord macpherson would famously come to the opposite conclusion in his report following the killing of black teenager stephen lawrence .
lord scarman said the police were not " institutionally racist " lord scarman recommended " racially prejudiced " behaviour should be made a specific offence under the police discipline code with offenders liable to dismissal .
his report led to an end to the sus law , the creation of the police complaints authority and police / community consultative groups as well as new approaches to police recruitment and training .
but it would be another 20 years before the police came under the scope of the race relations act with a duty to implement racially-sensitive policies .
and after the trouble spread to toxteth in liverpool in july the government announced the creation of an inner city task force with a £ 90m budget to spend nationwide .
political progress as well as the political fallout on a national scale , events in brixton added impetus to black people becoming politically active , first on a local and then on a national level .
in 1985 bernie grant became the first ethnic minority leader of a london council -lrb- haringey -rrb- and two years later was one of the first four people from an ethnic minority to be elected to parliament -lrb- as mp for tottenham -rrb- in modern times .
increased black political participation followed the riots the riots also helped crystallise plans by entrepreneur val mccalla to start a newspaper aimed at the black british community .
the voice , launched at the notting hill carnival in 1982 , quickly became a financial success largely due to job adverts by london boroughs which wanted to increase their diversity .
by the mid-1990s the voice 's influence in black british society was such that the then-metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon accused it of sparking a race riot in brixton over its reporting of the death of a young black man in police custody .

the rioting was sparked by the arrest of a black man the rioting which began in brixton , in the south london borough of lambeth , in april 1981 shocked the nation .
for three days , rioters - predominately young , black men - fought police , attacked buildings and set fire to vehicles .
more than 300 people were injured and the damage caused came to an estimated value of £ 7.5m.
what was most shocking to many people was the unexpectedness of events .
on the surface it seemed that black people were well-integrated into the fabric of uk society .
many were second generation , born to parents who had come to britain from the caribbean in the late 1940s and 1950s to help " the motherland " with post-war rebuilding .
have your say crime is still as much of an issue as it was 25 years ago in brixton kgbeep london , join the debate and there were high-profile success stories among britain 's black community .
trevor mcdonald had been presenting the news on television since 1973 , lenny henry was a popular comedian having won a tv talent show aged 17 in 1975 and daley thompson had won decathlon gold at the 1980 moscow olympics .
' sus ' law but below the surface tensions had been building up and on 11 april 1981 they boiled over in brixton , an area where 25 % of residents were from an ethnic minority group .
the days of full employment were long gone and in brixton around half of young black men had no job .
more than 100 officers were injured during the clashes an amended race relations act had become law in 1976 but police forces were granted an exemption from its conditions .
many young black men believed officers discriminated against them , particularly by use of the ' sus ' law under which anybody could be stopped and searched if officers merely suspected they might be planning to carry out a crime .
in early april , operation swamp - an attempt to cut street crime in brixton which used the sus law to stop more than 1,000 people in six days - heightened tensions .
unsubstantiated rumours of police brutality against a black man later led an angry crowd gathering to confront officers on the evening of 10 april for a few hours before the disturbances were contained .
but an arrest the following night sparked off the rioting in earnest .
but although its immediate causes were specific to brixton , the rioting was perhaps a sign of the times .
the mixture of high unemployment , deprivation , racial tensions and poor relations with police were not unique to brixton .
by the time lord scarman 's report on the events in brixton was published in november 1981 , similar disturbances had taken place in a raft of other english cities , most notably liverpool and manchester .
task force in his report lord scarman said there was " no doubt racial disadvantage was a fact of current british life " .
but he concluded that " institutional racism " did not exist in the metropolitan force .
eighteen years later lord macpherson would famously come to the opposite conclusion in his report following the killing of black teenager stephen lawrence .
lord scarman said the police were not " institutionally racist " lord scarman recommended " racially prejudiced " behaviour should be made a specific offence under the police discipline code with offenders liable to dismissal .
his report led to an end to the sus law , the creation of the police complaints authority and police / community consultative groups as well as new approaches to police recruitment and training .
but it would be another 20 years before the police came under the scope of the race relations act with a duty to implement racially-sensitive policies .
and after the trouble spread to toxteth in liverpool in july the government announced the creation of an inner city task force with a £ 90m budget to spend nationwide .
political progress as well as the political fallout on a national scale , events in brixton added impetus to black people becoming politically active , first on a local and then on a national level .
in 1985 bernie grant became the first ethnic minority leader of a london council -lrb- haringey -rrb- and two years later was one of the first four people from an ethnic minority to be elected to parliament -lrb- as mp for tottenham -rrb- in modern times .
increased black political participation followed the riots the riots also helped crystallise plans by entrepreneur val mccalla to start a newspaper aimed at the black british community .
the voice , launched at the notting hill carnival in 1982 , quickly became a financial success largely due to job adverts by london boroughs which wanted to increase their diversity .
by the mid-1990s the voice 's influence in black british society was such that the then-metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon accused it of sparking a race riot in brixton over its reporting of the death of a young black man in police custody .

in spite of initiatives such as the inner city task force and subsequently city action teams and the new deal , the " buppies " - young , upwardly mobile black people - of the 1980s were largely a passing phenomenon .
major race riots returned to the uk during the summer of 2001 since 1981 there has continued to be sporadic outbreaks of public disorder both in brixton and other major cities , most memorably in the north of england when white and asian youths clashed during the summer of 2001 .
eradicating the underlying social problems which are at the heart of many of the disturbances has swiftly climbed up the political agenda .
the labour government set up the social exclusion unit to tackle issues such as poverty and unemployment after its election victory in 1997 .

in early april , operation swamp - an attempt to cut street crime in brixton which used the sus law to stop more than 1,000 people in six days - heightened tensions .
unsubstantiated rumours of police brutality against a black man later led an angry crowd gathering to confront officers on the evening of 10 april for a few hours before the disturbances were contained .
but an arrest the following night sparked off the rioting in earnest .
but although its immediate causes were specific to brixton , the rioting was perhaps a sign of the times .
the mixture of high unemployment , deprivation , racial tensions and poor relations with police were not unique to brixton .
by the time lord scarman 's report on the events in brixton was published in november 1981 , similar disturbances had taken place in a raft of other english cities , most notably liverpool and manchester .
task force in his report lord scarman said there was " no doubt racial disadvantage was a fact of current british life " .
but he concluded that " institutional racism " did not exist in the metropolitan force .
eighteen years later lord macpherson would famously come to the opposite conclusion in his report following the killing of black teenager stephen lawrence .
lord scarman recommended " racially prejudiced " behaviour should be made a specific offence under the police discipline code with offenders liable to dismissal .
his report led to an end to the sus law , the creation of the police complaints authority and police / community consultative groups as well as new approaches to police recruitment and training .
but it would be another 20 years before the police came under the scope of the race relations act with a duty to implement racially-sensitive policies .
and after the trouble spread to toxteth in liverpool in july the government announced the creation of an inner city task force with a £ 90m budget to spend nationwide .
political progress as well as the political fallout on a national scale , events in brixton added impetus to black people becoming politically active , first on a local and then on a national level .
in 1985 bernie grant became the first ethnic minority leader of a london council -lrb- haringey -rrb- and two years later was one of the first four people from an ethnic minority to be elected to parliament -lrb- as mp for tottenham -rrb- in modern times .
the riots also helped crystallise plans by entrepreneur val mccalla to start a newspaper aimed at the black british community .
the voice , launched at the notting hill carnival in 1982 , quickly became a financial success largely due to job adverts by london boroughs which wanted to increase their diversity .
by the mid-1990s the voice 's influence in black british society was such that the then-metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon accused it of sparking a race riot in brixton over its reporting of the death of a young black man in police custody .
deprived area but the financial success of the voice was not duplicated by many other black-run businesses .
in spite of initiatives such as the inner city task force and subsequently city action teams and the new deal , the " buppies " - young , upwardly mobile black people - of the 1980s were largely a passing phenomenon .
since 1981 there has continued to be sporadic outbreaks of public disorder both in brixton and other major cities , most memorably in the north of england when white and asian youths clashed during the summer of 2001 .
eradicating the underlying social problems which are at the heart of many of the disturbances has swiftly climbed up the political agenda .
the labour government set up the social exclusion unit to tackle issues such as poverty and unemployment after its election victory in 1997 .
at the time of the 2001 census , nearly 40 % of lambeth residents were of ethnic minority origin .
and although pockets of brixton have gone upmarket , mainly due to an influx of city workers attracted by the area 's central location , in 2004 the london borough of lambeth was ranked the 23rd most deprived out of 354 english local authorities .
reports since the social exclusion unit was created have shown significant progress in some areas , such as reducing the number of children living in poverty and the number of people who sleep rough .
but other problems , such as the low academic achievement of boys of african caribbean and bangladeshi origin have proved harder to overcome .
and in spite of a government drive to bring more people into work , unemployment among ethnic minority communities is still twice the general rate .
the battle for brixton , an eyewitness account of the 1981 brixton riots told by rioters , police and local residents was broadcast on monday 10 april on bbc two at 1900 bst .

speculation had risen earlier this year that fl group , which owns icelandair , might make a bid for easyjet after it increased its stake in the airline .
however , fl has now sold its 16.9 % stake for about 325m euros -lrb- $ 397m ; £ 228m -rrb- , making a profit of 140m euros .
it said the proceeds from the sale would be used on new investments .
" fl group first invested in easyjet just under two years ago and the investment has proved to be a great success which has provided a foundation on which we have built fl group , " said chief executive hannes smarason .
" we are working on several interesting investment projects and the sale gives us the opportunity to look at more projects and some of greater scale . "
' strong ' finances shares in easyjet increased sharply in january as speculation swirled about the motive behind fl 's stake in the carrier .
as well as owning icelandair , fl also holds a 10 % stake in finnair and in october last year bought nordic airline sterling .
news that fl had sold its stake in easyjet sent the budget carrier 's shares down by more than 8 % in morning trade .
fl denied that the recent worries over the strength of iceland 's economy had anything to do with the sale .
such concerns have hit iceland 's currency and stock market in recent months .
last week , iceland 's central bank raised interest rates from 10.75 % to 11.5 % to keep a cap on inflation - the 13th rise in two years .
however , fl group said that it thought many comments made on the strength of the icelandic economy " do not take into account appropriately the strong assets that have been acquired by icelanders abroad " .
" fl group 's own financial position remains very strong , " it added .

the nith inshore lifeboat was scrambled at 0430 bst on wednesday following reports of three boats in trouble just south of glencaple .
the vessels , with eight cocklers onboard , were all brought ashore .
a spokesman for the coastguard agency said no-one was injured but criticised cocklers who seemed to be treating them as a " tow service " .
paul harrison of the liverpool coastguard said it was irresponsible and dangerous behaviour .
" they are not only putting themselves at risk , they are putting our crews at risk who are sent out to rescue or locate these people , " he said .

the fishery 's season will end later this month and re-open in august with stronger policing powers .
jock purdie of the solway shellfish management association fears stocks could be severely depleted by then .

paul harrison of the liverpool coastguard said it was irresponsible and dangerous behaviour .
" they are not only putting themselves at risk , they are putting our crews at risk who are sent out to rescue or locate these people , " he said .
" whether they think we are just a tow service - which we are not - we are there for safety of life . "
' real trouble ' meanwhile , the chairman of the organisation set up to regulate the solway cockle beds has again warned that they do not have enough powers to combat unlicensed operators .
the fishery 's season will end later this month and re-open in august with stronger policing powers .
jock purdie of the solway shellfish management association fears stocks could be severely depleted by then .
" we have heard rumours of boats coming in at night at the present moment , " he said .
" if they are stripping the beds then we are going to be having real trouble having anything left to actually fish for . "

it was seen in the constellation of cassiopeia , in a region where hot , young stars are forming .
the methanol was relatively easy to spot because of the way its molecules were being excited by infrared light .
but the new star that was the source of the radiation was not directly visible , being obscured by a huge cloud of dust .
this is an occupational hazard for scientists studying " stellar nurseries " ; the objects they most want to look at are hidden away in the early stages of the birthing process .
the observations of an area on the sky known as w3 -lrb- oh -rrb- mark an important progression for the multi-element radio linked interferometer network -lrb- merlin -rrb- .
the array of seven radio telescopes , with the famous 76m -lrb- 250ft -rrb- lovell dish at jodrell bank as its lead , is in the midst of an £ 8m upgrade designed to improve its sensitivity and data transfer capabilities .
" the e-merlin upgrade is happening right now , " said dr lisa harvey-smith , who was the principal investigator on the w3 -lrb- oh -rrb- study .
" the telescopes are getting fibre-optic links and they 've got new receivers ; and this discovery was the first observation made with the new receivers .
it proves that it all works and it 's great to see , " she told the bbc news website .
radio telescopes are important astronomical tools because they are better able to penetrate the clouds of dust and gas that hamper observations at other frequencies .
w3 -lrb- oh -rrb- 's alcohol stream , although excited by infrared starlight , can be seen clearly by merlin because the methanol molecules emit light at microwave wavelengths when they lose energy .
