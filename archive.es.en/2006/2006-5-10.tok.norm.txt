" expa n sio n questio n s also remai n with many citizens concerned about endless expansion , merkel added that it is important for the union to draw its borders and not take in new members before it can properly integrate existing ones . " we should try to keep our promises but at the same time we should be able to say to certain countries that their adhesion is not possible in the foreseeable future , " she said . bulgaria and romania , meanwhile , were still waiting for the commission to decide whether they can join the eu as planned on jan .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .
" and they immediately give children and young people the wrong picture .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .

" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member , " said günther nooke , the country 's human rights representative , before voting started .
" people have different opinions about which countries should be members . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german human rights representative günter nooke wanted his country on the council should nations with poor human rights records be members ? while some observers were concerned that countries with poor human rights records received seats on the council - china , cuba and saudi arabia were among the nations elected - others said integrating them into the process would promote human rights where they are lacking . " countries such as china , which are incredibly important for developments across the globe , must be involved in this new body overseeing human rights , " christoph strässer , the german social democratic party spokesman for human rights , told dw-radio .
" in fact , i hope they become involved enough so that we actually see progress in the area of human rights in these countries . " the united states has not applied for membership to the council and was against its creation , claiming that it would just repeat the mistakes of the former human rights commission .
the absence of the us could be a source of future tension , according to strässer . " it 's a pity the us has not applied ; i think it should be a member , " he said .
" but i hope it will at least contribute to the development of the body . "
once the initial members have been elected , they will meet for the first time in june to discuss their agenda . seats allocated by region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un general assembly voted overwhelmingly in march for new human rights body there were 47 seats to be had on the council and 64 countries vying for them .
election is by secret ballot and candidates must receive at least 96 votes to gain a seat - an absolute majority of the general assembly 's 191 members .
germany received 154 votes . the seats are allocated by region , with 13 reserved for africa , 13 for asia , six for eastern europe , eight for latin america and the caribbean and seven for the regional grouping known as " western european and other states , " which includes , among others , the united states , canada and israel . the six other slots designated to western europe and other states were allotted to britain , canada , finland , france , the netherlands and switzerland . time had come for a change manuel rodriguez cuadros , chairman of the un human rights commission until june 16 , said the creation of the new council was essential . " the human rights commission eventually became paralyzed and could not longer act , " he told dw-world.de.
" it had become an instrument for various countries seeking to pursue their foreign policies , which eventually damaged the commission 's reputation . " we realized that this kind of an organization needs more power , " rodriquez cuadros added .
" we also agreed that the un must focus much more intensely on defending and protecting human rights in this day and age .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .
" and they immediately give children and young people the wrong picture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .
-lrb- april 9 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends palestinian funding the european union said it would be suspending funding to the palestinian authority until the new hamas government recognised israel and put down the gun .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .

" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2006 expert panel against integrated bahn ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are still discussing which path the bahn 's ipo should take deutsche bahn 's chances of including its railways system in an ipo dropped wednesday after experts said there would be a considerable risk to taxpayers and competition if the company and tracks to go public together . while speaking at a meeting of the bundestag 's transportation committee , a group of 10 experts agreed on wednesday that german rail operator deutsche bahn should be separated from its physical railway system from the business operations before going public . the german rail company has only been able to survive because of the taxpayer funds it receives , said martin hellwig of the max-planck institute for research on collective goods . " it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .
-lrb- april 9 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends palestinian funding the european union said it would be suspending funding to the palestinian authority until the new hamas government recognised israel and put down the gun .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .
-lrb- april 9 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends palestinian funding the european union said it would be suspending funding to the palestinian authority until the new hamas government recognised israel and put down the gun .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .
" and they immediately give children and young people the wrong picture .

who says thieves are hardened criminals ?
a german cycling around the world for over four decades had his bicycle stolen .
but the thief must have had a soft spot for his resolute appeal to the media . for almost 44 years , heinz stücke traveled the world on his beloved three-speed black bicycle .
after 335,000 miles -lrb- 539,100 kilometers -rrb- , the " most traveled man in history " had his bike stolen in portsmouth , southern england as he slept in his tent . luckily for stücke , the thief reads the paper .
in an interview with the portsmouth news , he said he would do anything to get his bicycle back . " i am very emotionally attached to my bike , " stücke told the paper . just a short time later , police found his prized two-wheel companion in a nearby park .
stücke told bbc radio on wednesday he was rejoicing . " i expected it to be found , because it 's not a flashy one , it 's not an expensive one , " he said . the german cyclist left his home in hövelhof in 1962 and has never returned .
he has traveled through more than 200 countries and made it into the guinness book of world records . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " a selection of offbeat and quirky stories from dw-world 's from the fringe vault .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .

sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

" we should give the constitution one more chance but we need more time for the debate , " he said .
" at this stage the conditions have not been met to resolve the constitution issue .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

" it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs .

this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .
after a long absence , ukrainian captain and star forward andriy shevchenko will relish the chance of making the iberians sweat out another international competition . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ronaldinho : this will be brazil 's world cup midfielder ronaldinho is considered by many to be the world 's best soccer player .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran will be presented with new incentives from the eu while the us waits to add pressure the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london on may 19 to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program . european union negotiators britain , france and germany - the eu-3 - are drawing up a package of incentives to be discussed with russia , china and the united states , as well as sanctions that could follow if a deal is not reached . the package will be finished " over the next 10 days , with the goal of securing p5 plus 1 -lrb- permanent five members plus germany -rrb- endorsement for the eu-3 to then present the combined package to iran , " a western diplomat said wednesday in explaining the may 19 meeting . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said early tuesday the incentives included civilian nuclear energy cooperation , trade and technological exchanges " and , why not , in the area of security . "
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails .

but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

" it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member , " said günther nooke , the country 's human rights representative , before voting started .
" people have different opinions about which countries should be members . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german human rights representative günter nooke wanted his country on the council should nations with poor human rights records be members ? while some observers were concerned that countries with poor human rights records received seats on the council - china , cuba and saudi arabia were among the nations elected - others said integrating them into the process would promote human rights where they are lacking . " countries such as china , which are incredibly important for developments across the globe , must be involved in this new body overseeing human rights , " christoph strässer , the german social democratic party spokesman for human rights , told dw-radio .
" in fact , i hope they become involved enough so that we actually see progress in the area of human rights in these countries . " the united states has not applied for membership to the council and was against its creation , claiming that it would just repeat the mistakes of the former human rights commission .
the absence of the us could be a source of future tension , according to strässer . " it 's a pity the us has not applied ; i think it should be a member , " he said .
" but i hope it will at least contribute to the development of the body . "
once the initial members have been elected , they will meet for the first time in june to discuss their agenda . seats allocated by region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un general assembly voted overwhelmingly in march for new human rights body there were 47 seats to be had on the council and 64 countries vying for them .
election is by secret ballot and candidates must receive at least 96 votes to gain a seat - an absolute majority of the general assembly 's 191 members .
germany received 154 votes . the seats are allocated by region , with 13 reserved for africa , 13 for asia , six for eastern europe , eight for latin america and the caribbean and seven for the regional grouping known as " western european and other states , " which includes , among others , the united states , canada and israel . the six other slots designated to western europe and other states were allotted to britain , canada , finland , france , the netherlands and switzerland . time had come for a change manuel rodriguez cuadros , chairman of the un human rights commission until june 16 , said the creation of the new council was essential . " the human rights commission eventually became paralyzed and could not longer act , " he told dw-world.de.
" it had become an instrument for various countries seeking to pursue their foreign policies , which eventually damaged the commission 's reputation . " we realized that this kind of an organization needs more power , " rodriquez cuadros added .
" we also agreed that the un must focus much more intensely on defending and protecting human rights in this day and age .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .

schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 sevilla triumph in first european final to lift the uefa cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet taste of victory middlesbrough and sevilla contested the 2006 uefa cup final wednesday night and provided a fitting prelude to the coming world cup .
only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .
instead he had to make do with the distinction of taking his club team to their first european final - and presiding over one of the cup 's heaviest defeats . middlesbrough : schwarzer , paranaby , riggott , soutgate , queudrue , morrison , rochemback , boateng , downing , viduka , hasselbaink sevilla : palop , alves , navarro , escude , david , navas , merti , maresca , correia , fabiano , saviola dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new england coach hopes for uefa cup success as send off in his last game as club coach , new england boss steve mcclaren pits his middlesbrough team against spain 's sevilla in the uefa cup final in rotterdam on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2006 fatherhood becomes big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german fathers in question have n't really been spending time with their kids german authorities are looking into a spate of unusual cases in which jobless german men have used a legal loophole to assume fake paternities of foreign children and make a tidy sum of money . a few years ago , the case of a german pensioner drawing on generous social welfare while living it up in a beach-front apartment in florida triggered widespread indignation in germany and a change in the country 's welfare laws . now , in an echo of the " florida rolf " case , it 's emerged that jobless male berliners are using a loophole in a child rights law of 1998 to make some cash .
the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .
german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced legislation in early april to put a stop to such " false fatherhoods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

" it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .
instead he had to make do with the distinction of taking his club team to their first european final - and presiding over one of the cup 's heaviest defeats . middlesbrough : schwarzer , paranaby , riggott , soutgate , queudrue , morrison , rochemback , boateng , downing , viduka , hasselbaink sevilla : palop , alves , navarro , escude , david , navas , merti , maresca , correia , fabiano , saviola dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new england coach hopes for uefa cup success as send off in his last game as club coach , new england boss steve mcclaren pits his middlesbrough team against spain 's sevilla in the uefa cup final in rotterdam on wednesday night .

dw-world.de has made a list of the games that should n't be missed . group a germany vs. costa rica , june 9 the fates were smiling on germany during the world cup group lottery in december , nearly guaranteeing their advancement to the next round with group a games against costa rica , poland and ecuador .
germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .

" we need the leadership at all levels of our member states , " barroso told a joint sitting of eu assemblies at the european parliament .

" we should not rush things , " she said .
" we should instead wait for the right moment to act . " merkel insisted the eu still needed a constitution but said berlin would use its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 to push for a common eu energy policy and cut brussels ' red tape . " europe is not good enough , there is no question , " she said in berlin . the german leader is due to set out her thoughts on the future of europe in a keynote speech on thursday . on wednesday , barroso will present proposals on how to take europe forward ; suggestions that will be put to eu leaders at their summit next month . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , warned leaders to " take the anguish of europeans " seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and schüssel want the eu to become closer to its citizens " if we do n't succeed , it would be difficult to relaunch the constitutional process , " which he said had been " the most successful attempt in recent years to improve the lot of europeans .

" we need the leadership at all levels of our member states , " barroso told a joint sitting of eu assemblies at the european parliament .

" we should not rush things , " she said .
" we should instead wait for the right moment to act . " merkel insisted the eu still needed a constitution but said berlin would use its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 to push for a common eu energy policy and cut brussels ' red tape . " europe is not good enough , there is no question , " she said in berlin . the german leader is due to set out her thoughts on the future of europe in a keynote speech on thursday . on wednesday , barroso will present proposals on how to take europe forward ; suggestions that will be put to eu leaders at their summit next month . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , warned leaders to " take the anguish of europeans " seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and schüssel want the eu to become closer to its citizens " if we do n't succeed , it would be difficult to relaunch the constitutional process , " which he said had been " the most successful attempt in recent years to improve the lot of europeans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2006 fatherhood becomes big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german fathers in question have n't really been spending time with their kids german authorities are looking into a spate of unusual cases in which jobless german men have used a legal loophole to assume fake paternities of foreign children and make a tidy sum of money . a few years ago , the case of a german pensioner drawing on generous social welfare while living it up in a beach-front apartment in florida triggered widespread indignation in germany and a change in the country 's welfare laws . now , in an echo of the " florida rolf " case , it 's emerged that jobless male berliners are using a loophole in a child rights law of 1998 to make some cash .
the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .
german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced legislation in early april to put a stop to such " false fatherhoods .

dw-world.de has made a list of the games that should n't be missed . group a germany vs. costa rica , june 9 the fates were smiling on germany during the world cup group lottery in december , nearly guaranteeing their advancement to the next round with group a games against costa rica , poland and ecuador .
germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2006 fatherhood becomes big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german fathers in question have n't really been spending time with their kids german authorities are looking into a spate of unusual cases in which jobless german men have used a legal loophole to assume fake paternities of foreign children and make a tidy sum of money . a few years ago , the case of a german pensioner drawing on generous social welfare while living it up in a beach-front apartment in florida triggered widespread indignation in germany and a change in the country 's welfare laws . now , in an echo of the " florida rolf " case , it 's emerged that jobless male berliners are using a loophole in a child rights law of 1998 to make some cash .
the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .
german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced legislation in early april to put a stop to such " false fatherhoods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2006 expert panel against integrated bahn ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are still discussing which path the bahn 's ipo should take deutsche bahn 's chances of including its railways system in an ipo dropped wednesday after experts said there would be a considerable risk to taxpayers and competition if the company and tracks to go public together . while speaking at a meeting of the bundestag 's transportation committee , a group of 10 experts agreed on wednesday that german rail operator deutsche bahn should be separated from its physical railway system from the business operations before going public . the german rail company has only been able to survive because of the taxpayer funds it receives , said martin hellwig of the max-planck institute for research on collective goods . " it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 opinion : window-dressing in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' financial crisis is proving a burden to the palestinian people a decision by the middle east diplomatic quartet to create a temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the palestinians will not help ease the desperation in the west bank and gaza strip , says dw 's peter philipp . the decision by the quartet to temporarily channel funds to the palestinian territories will hardly effect any great change in the west bank and gaza strip .
one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .
-lrb- april 9 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends palestinian funding the european union said it would be suspending funding to the palestinian authority until the new hamas government recognised israel and put down the gun .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him .

he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .

once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .

washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails .

washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs .

the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs . " public health insurers and pension funds in germany finance more than 100,000 inpatient and outpatient withdrawal treatments annually . therapy i n stead of jail the model " therapy instead of penalty " has also been developed .
a drug addict convicted to a prison sentence of less than two years for a criminal offense can go into withdrawal treatment instead of going to jail .
the therapy 's duration is then deducted from the sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many drug addicts turn to crime to finance their habit this therapy usually lasts nine months .
according to hüllinghorst , the patient has the opportunity during this time to not only be physically healed , but also to develop new perspectives for his life and to reintegrate himself into society - which would n't be possible in prison . substitution therapy is another treatment used in germany .
the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .
hüllinghorst said it 's a successful concept . " we have thereby nullified the pressure to obtain drugs , can tackle health problems and expect then that these people who get substitution products at some point work together with therapists and can be influenced to leave drugs , " he said . heroi n as medici n e ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a sharp debate on the controlled distribution of heroin some 60,000 patients in germany undergo substitution treatment in germany .
but this therapy has not been successful with a small group of about 1,500 drug addicts .
for these people , experts are calling for increasing use of heroin as a means to get clean .
this means the patients are provided with the drug in a protected space , so that they do n't have to acquire it by criminal means .
at the same time , they are offered psychological and group therapy .
perspectives for the future can then be developed together . some attempts in the controlled distribution of heroin on the way to getting clean have already been made .
the result : the concept was successful among approximately half of the addicts .
still , it remains disputed in germany . legal drugs are also a problem but drug abuse is n't just limited to illegal substances , such as heroin or cocaine .
alcohol and tobacco misuse lead to serious health problems and even death . alcohol continues to play the dominant role in addiction in germany .
besides excessive nicotine use , alcohol abuse is the main cause of drug-related deaths in germany . according to dhs , there were in 2005 some 40,000 alcohol-related deaths , 111,000 deaths from smoking and " only " 1,385 deaths as a result of the consumption of illegal drugs . but this phenomenon is to a large extent still taboo and no one wants to talk about it , hüllinghorst said . " the normal citizen would , of course , rather deal with the consequences of drugs , because it 's not something that is close to him , " hüllinghorst said .
" he prefers to talk less about his own alcohol and cigarette consumption . " but dhs wants to change this .
it is calling on german politicians to provide significantly more financing for education campaigns , which show the dangers of drug consumption .
this should include the alleged harmless legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco . givi n g you n g people the wro n g picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers are increasingly taking up smoking at an early age according to hüllinghorst , dhs hopes that the federal government will implement the european union 's tobacco advertising guideline , which would mean that tobacco ads would be prohibited in europe . " the question of alcohol advertising continues to play a major role , " he said . according to hüllinghorst , 500 million euros -lrb- $ 639.4 million -rrb- is spent on alcohol advertising compared to some 10 million euros for prevention . " these are proportions , which just ca n't be right , " he said .
" and they immediately give children and young people the wrong picture . " monika hoegen -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report shows ever more germans addicted to legal substances increasingly , germans are becoming addicted to legal drugs , but the number of deaths from hard drugs fell , a new report says .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .
instead he had to make do with the distinction of taking his club team to their first european final - and presiding over one of the cup 's heaviest defeats . middlesbrough : schwarzer , paranaby , riggott , soutgate , queudrue , morrison , rochemback , boateng , downing , viduka , hasselbaink sevilla : palop , alves , navarro , escude , david , navas , merti , maresca , correia , fabiano , saviola dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new england coach hopes for uefa cup success as send off in his last game as club coach , new england boss steve mcclaren pits his middlesbrough team against spain 's sevilla in the uefa cup final in rotterdam on wednesday night .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .
instead he had to make do with the distinction of taking his club team to their first european final - and presiding over one of the cup 's heaviest defeats . middlesbrough : schwarzer , paranaby , riggott , soutgate , queudrue , morrison , rochemback , boateng , downing , viduka , hasselbaink sevilla : palop , alves , navarro , escude , david , navas , merti , maresca , correia , fabiano , saviola dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new england coach hopes for uefa cup success as send off in his last game as club coach , new england boss steve mcclaren pits his middlesbrough team against spain 's sevilla in the uefa cup final in rotterdam on wednesday night .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .

schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .

" pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

" it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 10.05.2006 world cup group games worth watching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeing all the group games means a lot of time in front of the tv with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .
dw-world.de has made a list of the games that should n't be missed . group a germany vs. costa rica , june 9 the fates were smiling on germany during the world cup group lottery in december , nearly guaranteeing their advancement to the next round with group a games against costa rica , poland and ecuador .
germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .
after a long absence , ukrainian captain and star forward andriy shevchenko will relish the chance of making the iberians sweat out another international competition . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ronaldinho : this will be brazil 's world cup midfielder ronaldinho is considered by many to be the world 's best soccer player .

iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .

sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed .

schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution remains on barroso 's " to do " list european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 . " we should give the constitution one more chance but we need more time for the debate , " he said .
" at this stage the conditions have not been met to resolve the constitution issue . " barroso 's call came almost a year into the so-called " period of reflection " about europe 's future announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's planned constitution , throwing the bloc into its worst-ever crisis . until then , he called on the leaders to draw up a declaration laying out their vision of europe 's future and commit to fulfilling its goals . " the first step towards an institutional settlement should be a political declaration adopted by european leaders , not only as a set of principles and values , but also as an obligation to engage and to deliver , " he said .
" it is important that european citizens know if their leaders are or not ready to engage , not only about principles and values , but about delivery of those policies , " he told reporters in brussels . the constitution was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu as it expands , but the referendums in france and the netherlands highlighted public disenchantment with the european project , and notably continued enlargement . fifteen members have ratified the constitution , and finland is likely to do so in july , but it must be adopted by all 25 nations to legally take effect . a number of countries have frozen the ratification process and france and the netherlands are unlikely to vote on it again as the text stands . complai n ts about eu leaders barroso complained that eu leaders often commit to action when they hold their summits but never actually provide europe 's institutions with the means to achieve those goals . " i am challenging national leaders ; we can not go on like in the past , " he said .
" when national leaders have success , it is their success , but when they suffer a failure , it is europe 's problem . " " we believe this declaration could be an important step to finding the solution and should be signed by the leaders ... and by the commission and the european parliament , " barroso said .
" hopefully this could be done next year - the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , the birth of our european community . " he said the text could serve as the basis for future decisions on how to deal with the constitution and would be developed by future eu presidencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doubts about the future cloud europe day european union leaders marked europe day plagued by questions about where their 25-member club is headed after a series of stinging setbacks last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 10.05.2006 world cup group games worth watching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeing all the group games means a lot of time in front of the tv with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .
dw-world.de has made a list of the games that should n't be missed . group a germany vs. costa rica , june 9 the fates were smiling on germany during the world cup group lottery in december , nearly guaranteeing their advancement to the next round with group a games against costa rica , poland and ecuador .
germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

" we should give the constitution one more chance but we need more time for the debate , " he said .
" at this stage the conditions have not been met to resolve the constitution issue . " barroso 's call came almost a year into the so-called " period of reflection " about europe 's future announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's planned constitution , throwing the bloc into its worst-ever crisis . until then , he called on the leaders to draw up a declaration laying out their vision of europe 's future and commit to fulfilling its goals . " the first step towards an institutional settlement should be a political declaration adopted by european leaders , not only as a set of principles and values , but also as an obligation to engage and to deliver , " he said .
" it is important that european citizens know if their leaders are or not ready to engage , not only about principles and values , but about delivery of those policies , " he told reporters in brussels . the constitution was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu as it expands , but the referendums in france and the netherlands highlighted public disenchantment with the european project , and notably continued enlargement . fifteen members have ratified the constitution , and finland is likely to do so in july , but it must be adopted by all 25 nations to legally take effect . a number of countries have frozen the ratification process and france and the netherlands are unlikely to vote on it again as the text stands . complai n ts about eu leaders barroso complained that eu leaders often commit to action when they hold their summits but never actually provide europe 's institutions with the means to achieve those goals . " i am challenging national leaders ; we can not go on like in the past , " he said .
" when national leaders have success , it is their success , but when they suffer a failure , it is europe 's problem . " " we believe this declaration could be an important step to finding the solution and should be signed by the leaders ... and by the commission and the european parliament , " barroso said .
" hopefully this could be done next year - the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , the birth of our european community . " he said the text could serve as the basis for future decisions on how to deal with the constitution and would be developed by future eu presidencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doubts about the future cloud europe day european union leaders marked europe day plagued by questions about where their 25-member club is headed after a series of stinging setbacks last year .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

germany is no exception .

" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .
that 's why it 's somewhat of a seismographic development among young people , which has a stronger impact on our society than the consumption of legal substances . "
dhs represents all 24 substance addiction organizations in germany . hüllinghorst added that german treatment and rehabilitation programs even surpassed those in neighboring liberal holland , which is very experienced in dealing with drugs . " when it comes to the treatment of addiction in general , we are clearly in the fore in europe , " hüllinghorst said .
" the treatment of dependency illnesses is a standard treatment .
health and pension fund insurers feel responsible and offer certain programs .

the patient gets an addictive-like substance , which at least temporarily simulates the drug .
this facilitates the withdrawal and gradually enables the patient to get clean .

" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member , " said günther nooke , the country 's human rights representative , before voting started .
" people have different opinions about which countries should be members . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german human rights representative günter nooke wanted his country on the council should nations with poor human rights records be members ? while some observers were concerned that countries with poor human rights records received seats on the council - china , cuba and saudi arabia were among the nations elected - others said integrating them into the process would promote human rights where they are lacking . " countries such as china , which are incredibly important for developments across the globe , must be involved in this new body overseeing human rights , " christoph strässer , the german social democratic party spokesman for human rights , told dw-radio .
" in fact , i hope they become involved enough so that we actually see progress in the area of human rights in these countries . " the united states has not applied for membership to the council and was against its creation , claiming that it would just repeat the mistakes of the former human rights commission .
the absence of the us could be a source of future tension , according to strässer . " it 's a pity the us has not applied ; i think it should be a member , " he said .
" but i hope it will at least contribute to the development of the body . "

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2006 fatherhood becomes big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german fathers in question have n't really been spending time with their kids german authorities are looking into a spate of unusual cases in which jobless german men have used a legal loophole to assume fake paternities of foreign children and make a tidy sum of money . a few years ago , the case of a german pensioner drawing on generous social welfare while living it up in a beach-front apartment in florida triggered widespread indignation in germany and a change in the country 's welfare laws . now , in an echo of the " florida rolf " case , it 's emerged that jobless male berliners are using a loophole in a child rights law of 1998 to make some cash .
the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .

schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

germany is no exception .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2006 expert panel against integrated bahn ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are still discussing which path the bahn 's ipo should take deutsche bahn 's chances of including its railways system in an ipo dropped wednesday after experts said there would be a considerable risk to taxpayers and competition if the company and tracks to go public together . while speaking at a meeting of the bundestag 's transportation committee , a group of 10 experts agreed on wednesday that german rail operator deutsche bahn should be separated from its physical railway system from the business operations before going public . the german rail company has only been able to survive because of the taxpayer funds it receives , said martin hellwig of the max-planck institute for research on collective goods . " it would be unbearable for taxpayers " if bahn head hartmut mehdorn 's plan to privatize the state-owned rail company gets the go ahead from politicians , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn wants the bahn to go public by the end of 2006 mehdorn has repeatedly said he wants the all of the bahn 's operations and track system to be made public as one to make the most of in-company synergies of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- .
the bahn is currently responsible for about 90 percent of rail transportation with other competitors claiming the remaining 10 percent . privatization can not be undone the chairman of the monopoly commission , jürgen basedow , pointed out to politicians that selling part of the railway network would be a nearly irreversible step that could only be undone by incurring high costs . splitting the company is politicians ' only real option , basedow concluded , adding that it would be risky for the government to allow the track network to be traded publicly , since only time will tell if the chosen privatization model is in line with european requirements . calling into question statistics provided by the bahn , berlin finance senator and former deutsche bahn head thilo sarrazin said according to his calculations the company 's long-distance passenger transportation deficit would increase to 1.7 billion euros by 2010 , which would force some 60,000 jobs to be cut . " if it can not lower costs , then the bahn is not ready to be put on the market , " said sarrazin , a social democrat . second hearing scheduled for june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are expected to choose a privatization model by september splitting the track network from the company 's operations would also have serious consequences , according to bahn representative otto wiesheu .
the deutsche bahn is among the top international rail companies and separating it from the track system could cost up to 80,000 jobs . the head of the transnet transportation union , norbert hansen , called the hearing " extremely one-sided and made a intentionally false " impression of the bahn 's privatisation plans . but hans peter friedrich , deputy chairman of the conservative christian union , said he did not think the government had decided on which privatization model it would support , adding he would wait until deutsche bahn officials receive a chance to respond to the experts ' testimony during a second hearing at the beginning of june . politicians hope to reach agreement by september on a plan for how and how much of the bahn will be privatized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail union threatens world cup strike over bahn plans plans by the german government to split up the state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn may lead to german railway workers staging strikes during the world cup .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .

" we need the leadership at all levels of our member states , " barroso told a joint sitting of eu assemblies at the european parliament .

" we should instead wait for the right moment to act .

" europe is not good enough , there is no question , " she said in berlin . the german leader is due to set out her thoughts on the future of europe in a keynote speech on thursday . on wednesday , barroso will present proposals on how to take europe forward ; suggestions that will be put to eu leaders at their summit next month . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , warned leaders to " take the anguish of europeans " seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and schüssel want the eu to become closer to its citizens " if we do n't succeed , it would be difficult to relaunch the constitutional process , " which he said had been " the most successful attempt in recent years to improve the lot of europeans . " expa n sio n questio n s also remai n with many citizens concerned about endless expansion , merkel added that it is important for the union to draw its borders and not take in new members before it can properly integrate existing ones . " we should try to keep our promises but at the same time we should be able to say to certain countries that their adhesion is not possible in the foreseeable future , " she said . bulgaria and romania , meanwhile , were still waiting for the commission to decide whether they can join the eu as planned on jan .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .

" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .

schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

" we need the leadership at all levels of our member states , " barroso told a joint sitting of eu assemblies at the european parliament .

" we should instead wait for the right moment to act . " merkel insisted the eu still needed a constitution but said berlin would use its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 to push for a common eu energy policy and cut brussels ' red tape . " europe is not good enough , there is no question , " she said in berlin . the german leader is due to set out her thoughts on the future of europe in a keynote speech on thursday . on wednesday , barroso will present proposals on how to take europe forward ; suggestions that will be put to eu leaders at their summit next month . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , warned leaders to " take the anguish of europeans " seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and schüssel want the eu to become closer to its citizens " if we do n't succeed , it would be difficult to relaunch the constitutional process , " which he said had been " the most successful attempt in recent years to improve the lot of europeans . " expa n sio n questio n s also remai n with many citizens concerned about endless expansion , merkel added that it is important for the union to draw its borders and not take in new members before it can properly integrate existing ones . " we should try to keep our promises but at the same time we should be able to say to certain countries that their adhesion is not possible in the foreseeable future , " she said . bulgaria and romania , meanwhile , were still waiting for the commission to decide whether they can join the eu as planned on jan .

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .
he too is contemplating a grand finale . " if it is my last game , it would be great to go out on a high , and in many respects it is all set up for me with the final being in holland , " he said .
" but you still have to make it happen , and i 'll do everything in my power - along with my team-mates - to ensure it is an unforgettable day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next england coach prepares for his final club game aside from winning the club the first silverware in its 130-year history by bringing the league cup to the riverside two seasons ago , mcclaren 's lasting legacy looks likely to be the academy . boro 's youth policy paying dividends surprise england world cup squad member stewart downing , stuart parnaby , lee cattermole and james morrison have all emerged to become first-team regulars this season , testament to the chairman steve gibson 's recognition that building a club is not simply about buying players . as a city , seville could hardly be more different from middlesbrough , but the football teams share a historical lack of success and a focus on youth . the spanish side have not appeared in a major final since losing to real madrid in the final of the copa del generalissimo in 1962 , and have won nothing since beating celta vigo in the final of the same competition 14 years earlier . sevilla growing in stature and confidence the 20-year-old jesus navas has been a revelation this season , while sevilla 's winner against schalke 04 in the semi-final was scored by the 21-year-old antonio puerta .
" sevilla are getting bigger and so are my dreams along with the team , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was a youth-team player and have been a sevilla fan since i was little .
up in heaven is my grandfather , who was a big sevilla fan , and my goal against schalke was for him . " others will have more earth-bound motivations on wednesday , with javier saviola -lrb- photo -rrb- seeing the final as a last chance to force himself into jose pekerman 's argentina squad , which will be announced next monday . injured stars looking to force themselves into cup contention for middlesbrough goalkeeper mark schwarzer , too , this is a chance to prove his world cup readiness .
he has not played in any of middlesbrough 's last five games after fracturing a cheek in the fa cup semi-final against west ham , but is likely to turn out wearing a face-mask on wednesday . " mark is back in training and the mask option will be looked at , " said his agent barry silkman .
" he will be trying out the mask in the next few days to see how it is , but he has been told he could play without it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boro 's australian keeper mark schwarzer will return for sevilla , defender javi navarro will return after missing the semi-final through suspension , while frederic kanoute could be available after a thigh injury . the former west ham and tottenham forward came off the bench against malaga on saturday , but seville coach juande ramos remains unconvinced . " he 's far from the level of fitness he showed earlier in the season because he had a relapse three weeks ago and has been unable to train normally , " he said .
" in the next few days we will see if we can improve his fitness because his aerial power could be very useful to see if we can use him as an extra option or in an emergency .

the spokesman added that the german government would send its response this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes wants to know whether the guarantee constitutes state aid kroes and her team want to find out whether the guarantee to cover 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- of the project 's costs constitutes state aid and if so , whether it was compatible with eu subsidy rules .
the european commission has the right to probe all large state aid payments made by eu governments and can block them or demand repayment if they are deemed illegal . " the commission has requested information from the german authorities so that we can verify that any state support is fully compatible with the eu state aid rules , " a spokesman for kroes told the financial times . dogged by controversy berlin granted the guarantee , the largest ever by the german government , last year .
according to the contract 's terms , berlin would step in should russian energy giant gazprom default on a loan aimed at financing part of a 5 billion euro undersea gas pipeline linking russia and germany . the guarantee is just the latest in a string of controversies to hit the north european gas pipeline -lrb- ngep -rrb- that would allow siberian gas to be pumped through the baltic sea to germany .
the ngep is 51-percent owned by gazprom , while german energy companies e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's close links with gazprom have sparked concerns last year , former german chancellor gerhard schröder was strongly criticized for deciding to head the pipeline project . poland and the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania are angry for being left out of the agreement .
earlier this month poland 's defense minister compared the deal to a pact made between nazi germany and the soviet union because poland was bypassed . " pipeline affair " turns murky the " pipeline affair , " as the issue is being called , raised hackles in germany last month after revelations that the guarantee was agreed to last year on oct .
24 , a month after the election that ended schröder 's second term as chancellor and just before he was to accept a post as head of the supervisory board of the consortium that is to build the pipeline .
schröder will draw 250,000 euros a year for the job . schröder , however , has denied any conflict of interest , saying he had not known of a request for a guarantee nor of his government 's decision to grant it .
gazprom also has said it will not draw the loan offered by deutsche bank and the state-owned kfw bank , nor take advantage of the guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline has run into controversy but , several german politicians , including some from schröder 's own social democratic party , are now calling for a parliamentary investigation into the affair . the issue also seems to have left a bad taste in russia 's mouth . last month russian daily nezavisimaya gazeta wrote that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...

" we have enjoyed some marvelous occasions and boro will always remain close to my heart , " mcclaren said . " i 'm so pleased i was able to deliver success to middlesbrough because everyone - especially the fans - deserves it .
hopefully we can top the lot on wednesday night .
that would be the perfect ending for me , and a wonderful platform to take the club forward into the future . " that future now seems unlikely to include the dutch forward jimmy floyd hasselbaink , who , at 34 , has yet to be offered a contract for next season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 sevilla triumph in first european final to lift the uefa cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet taste of victory middlesbrough and sevilla contested the 2006 uefa cup final wednesday night and provided a fitting prelude to the coming world cup .
only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2006 sevilla triumph in first european final to lift the uefa cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet taste of victory middlesbrough and sevilla contested the 2006 uefa cup final wednesday night and provided a fitting prelude to the coming world cup .
only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .
chris riggot 's intervention almost squirmed past his goalie after correia had slipped a low cross into the box .
he almost repeated the feat as sevilla stepped up the pressure . boro were playing a dangerous game by hitting the spanish team on the break ; a dubious tactic considering the rescue efforts needed after going behind to early goals in their previous two matches in the cup .
sevilla needed no further invitation and the primera liga side whizzed the ball around with aplomb as they looked for the breakthrough . premiership team hit by english move by spaniards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabiano puts sevilla 1-0 up sevilla continued to pull boro out of shape with rapid movement and one-touch passing and they were definitely ahead on points midway through the first half .
sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .
no longer was it the constant harrying of sevilla forcing them into mistakes , they were fluffing their lines with no help at all .
sevilla looked happy to sit back and wait for a mistake to capitalize on . maresca double ends middlesbrough 's cup dream that mistake came with just twelve minutes to go .
a sevilla counter attack swept from left to right , dragging boro 's defenders to the flanks .
navas dropped a shoulder and drifted inside before whipping in a shot which schwarzer fumbled .
enzo maresca was the first to react and he made sure from a meter out to make it 2-0 . five minutes later and boro 's cup dream was in tatters .
alves floated in a cross to the penalty spot which was headed meekly away ro maresca waiting on the edge of the box .
he took one touch to control the ball before guiding a volley past schwarzer for his second and sevilla 's third . the spanish team were n't finished .
with seconds remaining , maresca went for his hat-trick with a curling shot with the outside of his left foot .
schwarzer parried and the substitute kanoute was on hand to score the fourth from close range . boro 's coach steve mcclaren hoped to bow out with a major european trophy as a parting gift before taking charge of the england national team after the world cup .
instead he had to make do with the distinction of taking his club team to their first european final - and presiding over one of the cup 's heaviest defeats . middlesbrough : schwarzer , paranaby , riggott , soutgate , queudrue , morrison , rochemback , boateng , downing , viduka , hasselbaink sevilla : palop , alves , navarro , escude , david , navas , merti , maresca , correia , fabiano , saviola dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new england coach hopes for uefa cup success as send off in his last game as club coach , new england boss steve mcclaren pits his middlesbrough team against spain 's sevilla in the uefa cup final in rotterdam on wednesday night .

" countries such as china , which are incredibly important for developments across the globe , must be involved in this new body overseeing human rights , " christoph strässer , the german social democratic party spokesman for human rights , told dw-radio .
" in fact , i hope they become involved enough so that we actually see progress in the area of human rights in these countries . " the united states has not applied for membership to the council and was against its creation , claiming that it would just repeat the mistakes of the former human rights commission .
the absence of the us could be a source of future tension , according to strässer . " it 's a pity the us has not applied ; i think it should be a member , " he said .
" but i hope it will at least contribute to the development of the body . "
once the initial members have been elected , they will meet for the first time in june to discuss their agenda . seats allocated by region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un general assembly voted overwhelmingly in march for new human rights body there were 47 seats to be had on the council and 64 countries vying for them .
election is by secret ballot and candidates must receive at least 96 votes to gain a seat - an absolute majority of the general assembly 's 191 members .
germany received 154 votes . the seats are allocated by region , with 13 reserved for africa , 13 for asia , six for eastern europe , eight for latin america and the caribbean and seven for the regional grouping known as " western european and other states , " which includes , among others , the united states , canada and israel . the six other slots designated to western europe and other states were allotted to britain , canada , finland , france , the netherlands and switzerland . time had come for a change manuel rodriguez cuadros , chairman of the un human rights commission until june 16 , said the creation of the new council was essential . " the human rights commission eventually became paralyzed and could not longer act , " he told dw-world.de.
" it had become an instrument for various countries seeking to pursue their foreign policies , which eventually damaged the commission 's reputation . " we realized that this kind of an organization needs more power , " rodriquez cuadros added .
" we also agreed that the un must focus much more intensely on defending and protecting human rights in this day and age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 10.05.2006 world cup group games worth watching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeing all the group games means a lot of time in front of the tv with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .
dw-world.de has made a list of the games that should n't be missed . group a germany vs. costa rica , june 9 the fates were smiling on germany during the world cup group lottery in december , nearly guaranteeing their advancement to the next round with group a games against costa rica , poland and ecuador .
germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .
this is the game that will play a huge role in deciding which group a teams advance into the second round , and large numbers of neighboring poles are expected to give the german fans a run for their money in terms of team support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and england meet regularly on the international soccer stage group b england vs. sweden , june 20 both teams will be hoping they 've already qualified for the knock-out rounds before meeting in cologne , but even if that 's the case , do n't expect either side to hold back .
group b 's second place team is likely to face germany in the round of 16 .
england have n't beat sweden in 38 years and their chances at turning that around took a dip when striker wayne rooney broke his foot in april . both teams are confident of their chances ahead of the tournament .
england fans know their side has other stars , like … . , to help pick up some of the offensive slack , while the swedes , recalling their surviving of the 2002 world cup " group of death , " can count on their team 's ability to punch above their weight in international tournaments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian fans want more players to celebrate group c netherlands vs. argentina , june 21 debatably the most anticipated match of the group stage , this is the pair-up that made observers at the december group lottery in leipzig draw in their breath with delight .
the two teams from formidable soccer nations are both looking to add a new layer of polish to their reputations and a win in frankfurt would certainly do it . while a loss would leave either team with a bit of explaining to do to their fans who are beginning to wonder if they 'll ever live to see their team in the world cup final ever again , an impressive result would help the winning side convince people at home that they do , in fact , deserve admiration they still receive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is a favorite for the round of 16 group d portugal vs. mexico , june 21 mexico was fifa 's top seed for group d , but that 's not keeping experts from naming portugal the favorite to advance .
the pair of teams is also set against iran and angola , two sides that are n't expected to pose much of a threat , so the match in gelsenkirchen will decide who gets the lighter of the round of 16 opponents . portugal 's 11 have , however , been given a special incentive to use the game to get into shape for the next rounds - the portuguese soccer federation is offering national team players their biggest-ever bonus if they win the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy can hear the second round calling group e czech republic vs. italy , june 22 there are no pushovers in group e , which also features the usa and ghana , making every match crucial for all four teams , but it 's the czech republic-italy game in hamburg that could have the largest influence on the group .
a win for either team would nearly ensure its advancement , but a draw here and bookmakers will be left with a difficult time setting odds for any of the teams .
make sure to see the czech republic take on the azzurri and count on a close result in all the group e matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was impressive in front of a local crowd at the 2002 world cup group f croatia vs. japan , june 18 the battle for second place can also be exciting - just ask anyone who has ever been stuck in a group with brazil .
barring any major upsets against the reigning world champions , the winners of this game in nuremberg will be well on their way to the second round , as australia , pleased to have finally qualified for a world cup finals , is unlikely to pose a serious threat to second place . if you can only pick one group f game to watch , then this is the one .
do n't worry about missing the brazilian magic - you 'll see plenty of it in the knock-out rounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's zinedane zidane said he 'll retire after the 2006 tournament group g france vs. switzerland , june 13 group g is proof that first impressions can be deceiving .
france is the hands down favorite , but les bleus proved they know how to disappoint by dropping out of the 2002 cup without a goal , and switzerland proved to be a handful for the french side in qualification , with both the matches ending in draws . playing close to home , watch for the swiss , who edged past turkey on goal difference in the qualifier play-off , to be one of the surprise teams of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is slowly getting used to coming up short in international soccer group h spain vs. ukraine , june 14 serial underachievers , spain will have to use their opening group match against ukraine , who despite making their first trip to the finals were one of europe 's most impressive qualifiers , as a springboard for the two other contests with tunisia and saudi arabia .

washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

one of the main reasons is that the implementation of this decision will take weeks , if not months .
meanwhile , the situation of the palestinians is desolate .
up to a third of the palestinian population is dependent on the 150,000 civil servant salaries paid by the government .
or to be more precise - salaries that the government has n't been able to pay now for almost two months .
that amounts to $ 166 million -lrb- 130 million euros -rrb- every month . also missing are the $ 50 million per month that israel is obliged to pay on duties and taxes - money that it is withholding in trust for the palestinian authority .
the official aid payments from europe and the us have been stopped since hamas ' election victory .
according to the world bank , that amounts to a billion dollars a year .
despite offers of aid from the arab league , iran , russia and certain scandinavian countries , the money remains absent , because they ca n't find a way to transfer it . most international banks refuse to carry out transfers , because they 're afraid of american sanctions .
even saudi and egyptian banks give higher priority to their business relations with the us than showing solidarity with the palestinians .
in this respect , the members of the quartet did well by demanding that banks no longer face the threat of sanctions if they carry out these money transfers .
but this also made the quartet 's helplessness more than clear . quartet largely i n effectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet members held an emergency meeting on tuesday the quartet originally came together to offer the middle east a way out of the situation it has found itself in ever since the intifada sparked open animosity between the israelis and the palestinians .
but this concentrated effort by international powers brought little more into being than the " road map " - a non-binding middle east peace plan .
two of its central tenets : the violence has to stop , and both sides have to recognize each other . but the quartet has n't been able to push through two such self-evident conditions .
israel and the plo were able to make a step in the right direction in oslo .
but now that hamas has been elected to lead the palestinians , the quartet seems at a loss .
up until now , hamas has always rejected israel 's right to statehood , and welcomed and justified terrorist attacks against israel .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with such an organization - one that was branded a terrorist organization in europe and the us . and yet , hamas came to power in free elections - elections just as western powers had always demanded , and of which they were also proud .
that is , until the results were made known .
now the west has shown that it applies double standards . the west wanted to put pressure on the new hamas government , but instead it ended up oppressing the palestinian population .
the decision to partly reinstate palestinian aid is supposed to correct that mistake , but it wo n't deliver a solution .
that still lies with the principal actors themselves - hamas on the one hand , israel on the other .
everything else is just window-dressing , meant to disguise the fact that the middle east quartet is incapable of creating peace in the region . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspension of eu funds expected despite hamas protests the european union is expected monday to approve a decision to suspend palestinian aid , rejecting hamas ' claim that its cash-strapped government is being " blackmailed " by europe and washington .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .

germany are likely to rack up the goals against costa rica , but the majesty of the 2006 germany world cup 's opening game still makes it one to watch . but if you 're looking for on-the-field action instead of pageantry , turn in to the germany-poland match on june 14 .

"
washington has refused to give iran security guarantees . iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful , spurned earlier efforts by the eu-3 to wean it off its alleged weapons ambitions with economic and other incentives .
it has also waffled at a proposal by moscow to enrich uranium for the iranians on russian soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council plus germany are deadlocked the five permanent security council members plus germany are deadlocked over how to crack down on iran 's nuclear program , after tehran failed to comply with a council call on may 29 for the islamic republic to halt uranium enrichment , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material . the united states says iran is using a civilian nuclear program to hide the development of atomic weapons . washington , along with europe , favors a tough security council resolution that would require iran to comply .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium .
iranian allies russia and china oppose such a resolution , as they fear an escalation of the crisis . european incentives would give iran a choice , says us the united states said it would wait " a couple of weeks " before pressing for tough un action against iran while european negotiators draft the new incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us still wanted a " forceful response " " we agreed that we will continue to seek a -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution , but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the europeans design an offer to the iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told abc television . but she said washington was not abandoning efforts to seek a forceful response to iran 's suspected efforts to build a nuclear bomb , despite opposition from russia and china to any punitive measures . us wants council to send strong message " we are all in agreement that the security council has got to send a very strong message to iran that it ca n't continue to defy the international community .
and that 's what we 're going to do , " rice said .
" and we felt that waiting a couple of weeks is the way to allow diplomatic options to be fully pursued . " " iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and un security council action ; or iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu team will try again to broker a deal with iran the major powers are now trying to see if the eu-3 can come up with a package in which iran would get both carrots and the threat of sticks , namely a promise of security , political and trade benefits if it complies but a warning of sanctions if it does not . the europeans , backed by the united states , had already offered benefits last august but iran rejected this offer . " the challenge is this : the revised incentives have to be good enough to persuade russia and china that iran has to accept them but not too good to scare off the united states from endorsing them , " a diplomat with the european negotiating team told afp . doubts already over the viability of eu-3 proposals a senior european diplomat said the europeans hoped to finalize their proposal by friday , present it to their capitals and then get the p5 plus 1 to review the package on may 19 . the diplomat said however that he did not think " a serious package can be prepared on such short notice . " tehran this week made an apparent attempt to open a direct dialogue with washington in a letter from its hard-line leader mahmoud ahmadinejad to president george w. bush . ahmadinejad 's letter to bush dismissed by washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's letter to bush " offered nothing new " but rice again dismissed the letter as falling short of a serious attempt to address issues between iran and the west .
" it really does n't offer a solution to the nuclear impasse , " she told abc .
" it does n't talk about iran 's role in terrorism around the world .
and there really is n't anything there to consider it a diplomatic overture . " she said that " no-one in the international system is prepared to allow the iranians to get a nuclear weapon " and again refused to rule out military action if diplomacy fails . " we fully believe that a diplomatic course of a unified international community will bring the iranians to understand that they have no choice but to agree to a civil nuclear program that the international community can support .

" we should give the constitution one more chance but we need more time for the debate , " he said .
" at this stage the conditions have not been met to resolve the constitution issue . " barroso 's call came almost a year into the so-called " period of reflection " about europe 's future announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's planned constitution , throwing the bloc into its worst-ever crisis . until then , he called on the leaders to draw up a declaration laying out their vision of europe 's future and commit to fulfilling its goals . " the first step towards an institutional settlement should be a political declaration adopted by european leaders , not only as a set of principles and values , but also as an obligation to engage and to deliver , " he said .
" it is important that european citizens know if their leaders are or not ready to engage , not only about principles and values , but about delivery of those policies , " he told reporters in brussels . the constitution was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu as it expands , but the referendums in france and the netherlands highlighted public disenchantment with the european project , and notably continued enlargement . fifteen members have ratified the constitution , and finland is likely to do so in july , but it must be adopted by all 25 nations to legally take effect . a number of countries have frozen the ratification process and france and the netherlands are unlikely to vote on it again as the text stands . complai n ts about eu leaders barroso complained that eu leaders often commit to action when they hold their summits but never actually provide europe 's institutions with the means to achieve those goals . " i am challenging national leaders ; we can not go on like in the past , " he said .
" when national leaders have success , it is their success , but when they suffer a failure , it is europe 's problem . " " we believe this declaration could be an important step to finding the solution and should be signed by the leaders ... and by the commission and the european parliament , " barroso said .
" hopefully this could be done next year - the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , the birth of our european community . " he said the text could serve as the basis for future decisions on how to deal with the constitution and would be developed by future eu presidencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doubts about the future cloud europe day european union leaders marked europe day plagued by questions about where their 25-member club is headed after a series of stinging setbacks last year .

germany is no exception .
but it is leading the way in researching and treating addictions . experts in germany are calling for more funding for drug prevention and education , so that more can be done than just reacting with hindsight .
victims of illegal drugs in particular , such as heroin , cocaine or hashish , face an alarming situation . " we 're mainly talking about young people , " said spokesman rolf hüllinghorst from the german central office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- .
" they start to smoke fairly early and move relatively quickly on to other drugs .

" we should give the constitution one more chance but we need more time for the debate , " he said .
" at this stage the conditions have not been met to resolve the constitution issue . " barroso 's call came almost a year into the so-called " period of reflection " about europe 's future announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's planned constitution , throwing the bloc into its worst-ever crisis . until then , he called on the leaders to draw up a declaration laying out their vision of europe 's future and commit to fulfilling its goals . " the first step towards an institutional settlement should be a political declaration adopted by european leaders , not only as a set of principles and values , but also as an obligation to engage and to deliver , " he said .
" it is important that european citizens know if their leaders are or not ready to engage , not only about principles and values , but about delivery of those policies , " he told reporters in brussels . the constitution was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu as it expands , but the referendums in france and the netherlands highlighted public disenchantment with the european project , and notably continued enlargement . fifteen members have ratified the constitution , and finland is likely to do so in july , but it must be adopted by all 25 nations to legally take effect . a number of countries have frozen the ratification process and france and the netherlands are unlikely to vote on it again as the text stands . complai n ts about eu leaders barroso complained that eu leaders often commit to action when they hold their summits but never actually provide europe 's institutions with the means to achieve those goals . " i am challenging national leaders ; we can not go on like in the past , " he said .
" when national leaders have success , it is their success , but when they suffer a failure , it is europe 's problem . " " we believe this declaration could be an important step to finding the solution and should be signed by the leaders ... and by the commission and the european parliament , " barroso said .
" hopefully this could be done next year - the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , the birth of our european community . " he said the text could serve as the basis for future decisions on how to deal with the constitution and would be developed by future eu presidencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doubts about the future cloud europe day european union leaders marked europe day plagued by questions about where their 25-member club is headed after a series of stinging setbacks last year .

only one team could win and that was sevilla , lifting the trophy after a 4-0 win . one of european soccer 's last showpieces before the season 's end was played out in balmy temperatures in eindhoven on wednesday night as english premiership team middlesbrough took on spain 's sevilla in what was the first european final for both sides . the preliminaries were played out in brilliant sunshine as the two sets of supporters danced , drank and sang together in a carnival atmosphere in the dutch town where high-spirited english and spanish supporters embraced each other and the spirit of the game before the two teams emerged onto the pristine pitch at the philips stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : middlesbrough 's defense was under almost constant siege boro found themselves in the final after nail-biting quarter- and semi-final comebacks and were looking to add the uefa cup to the 2004 english league cup in their trophy cabinet .
sevilla had also dusted their shelves down in anticipation of adding the cup to their only trophy , the 1948 copa del generalissimo . with such a historic victory awaiting one of the teams , the game started nervously as both clubs looked to settle first .
sevilla looked the more confident in the early stages with daniel alves firing in the first shot on two minutes , a long range effort which curled away from mark schwarzer but flew just wide . boro responded in typically robust style with fabio rochemback cracking a 25-meter free kick at goal five minutes later which andres palop found too hot to handle. javi navarro just managed to hook the looose ball away as stewart downing looked to capitalize . the premiership team almost scored a minute later but at the wrong end .

sevilla then converted their possession into a goal on 27 minutes .
a whipped cross into the box from alves was met with a bullet header from luis fabiano which cannoned off the post and over the line with schwarzer rooted to the spot . despite their recent reputation for staging breath-taking comebacks , boro rarely threatened an equalizer as the first 45 minutes ticked away with sevilla comfortably in control . the english team were first out of the blocks in the second half as boro went in search of parity with last-gasp striking hero massimo maccarone on for midfielder james morrsion .
sevilla also brought on an extra attacker in freddie kanoute , raising the stakes higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : navas slips past quedrue boro 's search for an equalizer almost back-fired when sevilla caught them on the break and correia drifted inside quedue on the left to bend a shot over schwarzer but also just over the bar on 49 minutes .
boro responded quickly with their first real shot on goal two minutes later when mark viduka blasted a close range shot at palop 's legs with the goal gaping . with 30 minutes to play , boro started to look desperate .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is said to be misused by young single foreign women " we 're aware of such cases , " thomas blesing , city councilor of the neukölln district in berlin told news agency dpa .
" these women are often threatened with deportation and so they present a german man who says he 's the father of their children . " since the law does n't prescribe paternity tests , the authorities are forced to accept the statements of both the mother and the false father , blesing added .
once the german father steps forward and assumes fatherhood , the foreign child can get german citizenship almost immediately . the mother can thus stake a claim to childcare handouts and social welfare , including healthcare for her children .
usually , she then gets the right to residence in order to look after her children . " a thorn in our side " blesing added that german men were often illegally paid a generous sum for assuming fake paternities and some even deliberately fathered children in different german cities in order to avoid making the authorities suspicious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless fathers are said to make thousands of euros through the law " something like this can get unemployed men around 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,100 -rrb- a year , " he said .
blesing said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of cases where the law was abused .
" but it 's quite a considerable number , " he said .
" it 's a thorn in our side . " german wants to father 1,000 foreign children der spiegel reported on the case of a man from the rhine river region who plans to assume paternity by the end of the year of 1,000 foreign children from poor countries . the man , jürgen hass , wants to give the kids an opportunity to study and get access to the german social welfare system by declaring them his own . a former politician with the free-market liberal fdp , hass has said he wants to help the children , but also underlined that he wants to lead a " personal , private retribution campaign " against the german state .
hass was apparently jailed for three years in 1987 for fraud , though he says he was innocent . the paternity adventure of unemployed german men might come to an end sooner rather than later .
german justice minister brigitte zypries introduced legislation in early april to put a stop to such " false fatherhoods .

the law allows men to assume paternity when the mother is willing and no other man steps forward to declare himself the father . no paternity tests required a report in newsmagazine der spiegel said the law served to help single mothers without german citizenship to stay in the country if they presented a german father to their children .
in return , the german men often received money as a gesture of thanks from the women .

we used the opportunity to tell you about high definition television - hdtv .
hd ready tvs are being sold alongside adverts promoting world cup matches in the new format .
but following our report , several breakfast viewers contacted us to say that you were having problems getting hold of the kit in time .
breakfast 's susannah streeter explained the background to delays with equipment you can watch both reports via the links on the right of this page our report on hdtv was the second part of our series about the changing face of broadcast technology .
in the first of our series , we looked at digital television , something that will affect us all when programmes are no longer transmitted on analogue .
on wednesday we turned our attention to high definition television - or hdtv - and that will dramatically improve the quality of sound and pictures .
wednesday on breakfast : susannah streeter reported live from belfast at the first bbc news and sport on tour event .
she took the opportunity to find out about the bbc 's new high definition services , which launch today .
jump straight to our full list of tour dates simple guide to high definition television what is high definition television ?
in simple terms , high definition television signals send out more information to your television set allowing clearer , sharper and more colourful pictures ; as well as higher quality sound .
known as hdtv , it 's basically a new format for broadcasting pictures .
while normal tv screens have around half a million pixels , hd sets can have as many as two million - which makes for a much sharper picture .
will i need a special television ?
yes , you will need a television that is described as ' hd ready ' the hd ready logo , shows that new equipment will be compatible if you 're thinking of buying a new television set , or other equipment , you will need to look out for the logo shown on the right hand side of this page .
the cheapest hd tvs start at around £ 500 , hd ready televisions will have all the necessary connectors but will need to be linked to compatible equipment such as dvd machines .
will everyone be able to receive hdtv pictures ?
no you will need one of the compatible digital ' platforms ' ; for example digital cable or satellite - so you will need to have an hd set top box .
at the moment it 's not known whether you will be able to receive hdtv via freeview because there is no room available on freeview for hd channels , at least until the digital switchover takes place .
also , an existing digital sky box will not be able to receive hd , you should contact your main service provider before investing in a new television as you may have to spend more to upgrade your receiver .
will i still be able to see tv pictures in the existing format ?
yes , you wo n't be forced to upgrade to hd , and pictures in the existing format should continue for many years .
for a more comprehensive guide , follow the links to the specialist bbc websites complete hdtv guide the bbc news website also has an in-depth section on the news and sport tour , but we 've provided a summary of dates and locations below bbc news and sport on tour - in-depth news and sport on tour dates : belfast wednesday 10 to friday 12 may the balmoral show , belfast .

in simple terms , high definition television signals send out more information to your television set allowing clearer , sharper and more colourful pictures ; as well as higher quality sound .
known as hdtv , it 's basically a new format for broadcasting pictures .
while normal tv screens have around half a million pixels , hd sets can have as many as two million - which makes for a much sharper picture .
will i need a special television ?
yes , you will need a television that is described as ' hd ready ' the hd ready logo , shows that new equipment will be compatible if you 're thinking of buying a new television set , or other equipment , you will need to look out for the logo shown on the right hand side of this page .
the cheapest hd tvs start at around £ 500 , hd ready televisions will have all the necessary connectors but will need to be linked to compatible equipment such as dvd machines .
will everyone be able to receive hdtv pictures ?
no you will need one of the compatible digital ' platforms ' ; for example digital cable or satellite - so you will need to have an hd set top box .
at the moment it 's not known whether you will be able to receive hdtv via freeview because there is no room available on freeview for hd channels , at least until the digital switchover takes place .
also , an existing digital sky box will not be able to receive hd , you should contact your main service provider before investing in a new television as you may have to spend more to upgrade your receiver .
will i still be able to see tv pictures in the existing format ?
yes , you wo n't be forced to upgrade to hd , and pictures in the existing format should continue for many years .

gamers had already had a taste of what next generation gaming could be in the shape of microsoft 's xbox 360 .
and on the sidelines is nintendo 's wii , promising to shake up gaming with its motion-sensing controller .
sony had to come up with something to make fans across the world stand up and take notice .
hundreds of guests , journalists and industry analysts packed into one of sony 's hollywood studios on a warm monday afternoon to be wowed .
two hours later , they shuffled out knowing the launch date and the price of the system , but feeling somewhat let down .
have your say " why should the consumer be limited to one type of console ?
vive la difference i say " carl pheasant , london your questions answered there was nothing wrong with the games sony demonstrated .
it was more that they looked pretty much like games on the xbox 360 .
even the tilt-sensitive controller came across as ill-conceived compared with the controller for the wii .
while sony showed off one game in which you could control a plane by moving the controller around , nintendo 's whole presentation was based around a new way of playing games .
play time after the workmanlike quality of the sony presentation , nintendo was a breath of fresh air .
it began off with a vigorous performance by nintendo guru shigeru miyamoto , conducting an orchestra by waving the wii controller in the air .
from the start , it was clear that nintendo had one aim - to show how much fun you could have , by yourself or with others .
it reflects the different approach of the makers of mario and zelda .
nintendo is ploughing a different path to rivals sony and microsoft .
nintendo is clearly pinning its hopes that gamers will turn their backs on high-definition graphics in favour of new gaming experiences .
judging by first impressions , the wii may be just the console to change how we think about video games .
but that still leaves sony and microsoft slugging it out for gamers hungry for photo-realistic and intense shooting or racing games .
here , the software giant from seattle has a considerable advantage .
its xbox 360 is already out and , after some supply shortages , readily available in the shops .
second wave microsoft is keeping up the pressure with a raft of new games due out this year .
the first titles for the xbox 360 on release were good , but there was no halo or grand theft auto among them .
microsoft has to make sure this second wave is sensational , to build on the head start it has gained by launching its console first .
the question for gamers is whether to take the plunge into the world of xbox now , or wait until later in the year for the ps3 or the wii .
nintendo can probably count on dedicated fans , and those attracted by the sheer unconventional nature of the wii 's controllers and its promise of unadulterated fun .
but sony could find itself being squeezed from both sides .
it has the most to lose , as it dominates the current set of consoles , having sold more than 100 million playstation 2s .
the strength of the playstation brand can not be underestimated and this will help sony .
but it is clear that the company has a lot of work to do between now and the planned november launch of the ps3 to remain the king of home console gaming .

microsoft has to make sure this second wave is sensational , to build on the head start it has gained by launching its console first .
the question for gamers is whether to take the plunge into the world of xbox now , or wait until later in the year for the ps3 or the wii .
nintendo can probably count on dedicated fans , and those attracted by the sheer unconventional nature of the wii 's controllers and its promise of unadulterated fun .

we talked to two who failed - and to sir alan himself fourteen hopefuls have been whittled down to two - and tonight , we 'll find out who 's hired and who 's fired in the final episode of the apprentice .
the reality tv series has been an unexpected hit for the bbc 's - and has turned sir alan sugar into a household name .
amid tears , tantrums and boardroom rantings , sir alan has dispensed with the services of 12 hopefuls so far , leaving two of the women - michelle and ruth - to battle it out .
neither have had an easy ride from sir alan who 's been dishing out feedback in his customary blunt style .
but tonight one of the women will hear the words " you 're hired ! "
this morning on breakfast : sugar : " what you see is what you get " we talked to sir alan himself , live from his home .
" i 'm not an actor , " he told us .
" what you see is what you get . "
he refused to be drawn on who 'll win tonight 's final , which has already been filmed , but he did tell us : " it 's been so hard to choose between the two .
they 're both very capable although they have completely different skill sets .
" it was a terrible decision . " watch our interview in full with sir alan sugar we also talked to two of the candidates who have already been turned down : jo cameron and syed ahmed .
jo and syed : labelled the liar and the nutter we put to them the labels " the nutter " and " the liar " which they were given by sir alan 's team .
" i do n't deny that sometimes i 'm a nutter , " said jo .
" that 's some of me some of the time - not all of me all of the time . "
syed does n't accept the label " liar " but he does reckon he learned from his time on the show - and he has used that to help run the company he set up 18 months ago. watch our interview in full with syed and jo tomorrow morning , we 'll be talking live to the winner of the apprentice .

cuba , china and pakistan are among many nations considered to have poor rights records which have joined the new body .
the us envoy to the un , john bolton , said the council looked set to inherit the flaws of its predecessor , the discredited un human rights commission .
rights groups have broadly welcomed the creation of the new council .
many countries that had belonged to the disbanded human rights commission and had been accused of violating human rights did not seek membership to the council .
the head of new york-based pressure group , human rights watch , said the absence of several " spoiler governments " from the new body would make its work easier .
" that does n't guarantee that the council will be a success but it is a step in the right direction , " kenneth roth told the associated press news agency .
' resounding victory ' the us has opposed the council 's creation , arguing it did not go far enough to prevent countries with bad rights records from winning seats .
the new council is seen as a key part of broader un reforms responding to the election of cuba to the council , mr bolton said sarcastically : " what a joy " , the afp news agency reported .
" that simply says that the deficiencies from the previous commission may well now still be carried over . "
cuba , however , said its election was a " resounding victory " and a snub to the us .
mr bolton said the us , which did not stand , would work with member states " to make the council as strong and effective as it can be " .
rights pledge a total of 67 countries stood for the council .
several criticised for abusing human rights - including china , saudi arabia , pakistan and russia - were elected .
human rights watch had urged the un not to elect them .
human rights council seats africa : 13 asia : 13 latin america and caribbean : 8 eastern europe : 6 western europe and others : 7 but a spokesman for the group told the bbc that they had expected most of those five to win places because of their political power .
venezuela and iran - also judged unsuitable - failed to win election .
russia was one of six eastern european nations election onto the new body .
the others were azerbaijan , czech republic , poland , romania and ukraine each nation standing for election had to pledge to promote human rights .
campaigners hope it will be less politicised and more willing to act on abuse than its predecessor .
' bad joke ' many recent commission members with poor human rights records did not stand for election , including sudan , zimbabwe , syria , nepal , eritrea and ethiopia .
the bbc 's laura trevelyan , at the un , says the old commission was widely seen as a bad joke .
whether the new human rights council really represents an improvement on the old commission depends on how it acts from hereon in , she adds .
the creation of the human rights council is seen as a key component of overall reform of the united nations .
the regional composition of the new council is based on population .
to get a seat a country had to be elected by a majority vote of the 191-member general assembly .
the council will be based in geneva and is expected to hold its first meeting on 19 june .

several recent media reports have suggested the syndrome as a cause of anti-social and threatening behaviour .
but the study of over a million people in wales found " very little data " to link the mild form of autism with criminal behaviour .
the syndrome can lead to people having communication problems or understanding the consequences of their actions .
it affects as many as one in every 250 people .
awareness of the syndrome has grown since the publication of novel the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by mark haddon , which portrays the life of a child growing up with the condition .
in january , an 18-year-old from manchester claimed to suffer from the syndrome when he was jailed for murdering a 10-year - old girl . "
on the basis of our evidence there 's very little data to support that association between asperger 's syndrome and criminal behaviour " professor david allen there was no medical evidence to suggest he was a sufferer .
a team led by professor david allen , of bridgend-based bro morgannwg nhs trust , studied a population area of over a million people across south wales , to find whether those involved in criminal behaviour actually showed characteristics of the syndrome .
prof allen said : " we 've been to as many relevant services we could to see if they were supporting people with asperger 's syndrome .
" we found very few people - only a group of just over 30 people - which surprised us .
" on the basis of our evidence there 's very little data to support that association between asperger 's syndrome and criminal behaviour . "
the research will be presented to an international autism conference in cardiff on wednesday , hosted by autism cymru .
clinical psychologist dr tony attwood , from queensland , australia said the findings were important to inform the public .
" if there 's a sensational case and asperger 's is involved the media will automatically assume that everyone with asperger 's syndrome will commit that type of offence - and that 's not true , " he said .
dr attwood also thinks the criminal justice system needs to be better informed in how to deal with people living with asperger 's .
" when offences do occur , they need to be aware in terms of criminality , sentencing and support for that person . "
mark annis , a penarth artist who has asperger 's syndrome.said the condition has led to him being misunderstood .
" it does make life very difficult for me - it can get you into trouble really , " he said .
" people treat me as if i was at fault - they think they can ride roughshod over me and get away with it . "
the three-day conference has drawn specialists from across the world as well as families who have experience of living with different forms of autism .

they were winched to safety by helicopter , after sending mobile phone text messages to relatives with their approximate location .
john tabo , his 20-year-old son and teenage nephew survived on raw squid and rainwater for three weeks .
they had left their home on murray island , which lies in between northern australia and papua new guinea .
they were heading for another island 70km -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- away , but got lost in heavy seas and soon ran out of fuel .
rescuers began looking for them and their small dinghy , but gave up after five days because of an approaching cyclone .
full recovery relatives thought the men were dead .
that was until they received a text message saying that their boat had drifted back into familiar waters near murray island .
emergency crews were immediately sent to this remote area in the torres strait and the missing sailors were found .
all three are recovering in hospital , suffering from severe dehydration and extreme weight loss .
medical staff have said they are exhausted and traumatised but should make a full recovery .
it has been quite a week for dramatic stories of survival in australia .
the lost boatmen were found alive the same day that a pair of tasmanian miners were rescued from a gold mine after spending 14 days trapped underground .
