some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush in washington on jan .
13 according to an article to be published monday in the german weekly focus , bush told merkel he would free kurnaz on condition that germany give " guarantees of security , " the details of which are now being discussed by german diplomats and government security experts .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .
book claims stasi employed nazis as spies the former east germany 's feared stasi secret police set nazi officers to work as spies and protected them from prosecution , according to a new book that belies the official anti-fascist stance of the communist regime .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .

" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .
they hope the move will lower non-wage labor costs : pensions contributions make up almost 20 percent of non-wage labor costs and are shared equally between employers and employees . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .
they hope the move will lower non-wage labor costs : pensions contributions make up almost 20 percent of non-wage labor costs and are shared equally between employers and employees . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .

keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .
they hope the move will lower non-wage labor costs : pensions contributions make up almost 20 percent of non-wage labor costs and are shared equally between employers and employees . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.02.2006 german study questions eco-friendliness of plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do trees and plants give up more greenhouse gas then they absorb ?
the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .
book claims stasi employed nazis as spies the former east germany 's feared stasi secret police set nazi officers to work as spies and protected them from prosecution , according to a new book that belies the official anti-fascist stance of the communist regime .

little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .

it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .

" if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .

" more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .

" more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .

" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .

now , huge investment has turned it into a state-of-the-art center of excellence where german athletes train for olympic glory . oberhof is an unassuming little town in the eastern german state of thuringia .
with a population of around 2,000 people , it barely registers as a settlement outside its local boundaries .
while for the majority of the year oberhof lacks much in the way of excitement or attractions for most of the outside world , the town becomes a focus for winter sports fans once the snow starts to hit the ground . oberhof is transformed during the winter .
while the town itself may not take up too much space on the local map , its state-of-the-art rennsteig arena certainly does .
little oberhof hosted the 2004 biathlon world cup in the impressive stadium and is also the location for annual championship ski jumping events and international tobogganing championships . but every four years , the town suffers a winter lull .
such a cycle may be cause for concern in some circles but when the snow on the cross-country skiing course remains pure and driven and the sledging tubes are as smooth as glass , fewer people in germany are more happy and proud .
this is because the winter athletes that flock to the events and facilities around town are off somewhere around the world representing germany at the winter olympics . local athletes bring back gold , silver , bronze and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wins the men 's doubles at the luge world cup in oberhof in january " we are so very proud , " said the state 's minister of infrastructure , andreas trautvetter . and rightly so .
at the last winter olympics , local athletes who regularly train and compete in oberhof came home from salt lake city with six gold medals , six silver and two bronze after representing germany ; a haul which was almost half of all the medals won by the whole german team . while some consider bavaria to the home of german winter sports , with its alps and regular snowfall , most will not realize that thuringia , and oberhof specifically , was chosen as the site where winter sports excellence would be strived for when former chancellor helmut kohl surveyed the reunified land after the fall of the berlin wall 16 years ago . the investment and winter sports infrastructure on show in oberhof is unique in germany and when viewed as a whole complex , it is unsurprising that german olympic athletes choose to come to the town to prepare for the winter games . investment in people and infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberhof provides winter athletes with a wide range of practice runs as well as the rennsteig arena , there is an outdoor and indoor shooting hall for the biathlon 's rifle discipline ; several winter cross-country skiing routes and summer ski-rolling tracks , six full size ski jumping slopes , the bobsleigh run and toboggan run with separate start training areas and computer-controlled treadmills which can be programmed to simulate any cross-country skiing course in the world including , naturally , those in turin . in the spring , oberhof will present the first ski tunnel in germany .
it will be 1,400 meters long , six meters wide and will offer athletes the opportunity to make training runs on snow in high summer .
the 12-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- project should be opened in the summer of 2008 , in good time to be used as a training facility for the winter games in vancouver in 2010 . in addition to the technical and training support the facilities offer germany 's top winter athletes , oberhof continues to educate and inspire the stars of the future in a purpose built sports school . east germany 's winter mecca now springboard to the world the choice of oberhof as the recipient of some 60 million euros may have seemed like a strange one to many people in the west of the germany .
but for those from the former east germany , it was the natural choice .
just as chemnitz was , and remains so , the center of germany 's successful skating production line , oberhof was already the focus of the east 's skiing ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's next generation will benefit from the facilities at oberhof as with any sporting center of excellence of the former gdr , oberhof has suffered allegations of doping and stasi secret police meddling but the post-wall makeover , and the subsequent successes which have followed for the unified germany , have done much to transform the place and the town 's sporting reputation . now the town holds the key to olympic glory for future generations of german winter athletes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .

keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research .

one of the conditions could be that german law enforcement authorities observe kurnaz at all times . kurnaz , a turkish national born in the north german city of bremen , was arrested in 2002 by american forces in pakistan , where he had moved in 2001 .
the german press nicknamed him " the taliban of bremen .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .

presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .

it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .

the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .

keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .
they hope the move will lower non-wage labor costs : pensions contributions make up almost 20 percent of non-wage labor costs and are shared equally between employers and employees . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .

" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .

some politicians now have already started to demand exceptions . earlier this month , labor minister franz müntefering announced that the phase-in period of the new retirement age - in an effort to secure germany 's creaking state pension system - would be completed in 2029 rather than 2035 as previously planned . the move does not sit well with members of müntefering 's social democratic party such as karl franz , the head of the workers ' council at the eisenach plant of german car maker opel . franz said working on the plant 's assembly line beyond the age of 50 is impossible : the job is so physically demanding that only younger workers can keep doing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel production in germany " opel has invested a lot in a healthy job environment in order to keep workers employed longer than in the past , " he said .
" but working under such intense conditions until the age of 67 is an abolute illusion . " in recent years , opel has sent most of its older workers on early retirement , paying out generous compensation to tide its workers over the period until full retirement at 65 . throwing the system out of balance the method , however , has come under the criticism of müntefering .
shedding older workers well before retirement age is one reason why germany 's statutory pensions system has been thrown out of balance , the minister says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans getting to old ?
the other one is that people become much older thus enjoying their pensions for much longer than in the past .
according to müntefering , the german pay-as-you-go pension system is bound to collapse if the current situation goes on like this . " primary school arithmetic is enough to understand why we have to act , " he said .
" those who deny this ignore the realities of the present day . " ignoring realities ? but müntefering himself stands accused of ignoring realities .
critics , even from within his own social democrats , say it 's impossible to keep hard-working roof layers , miners or factory workers toiling until 67 . kurt beck , spd premier in the state of rhineland-palatinate and up for re-election this year , demands the government allows exceptions to the rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some decide to attend university again " the realities of life must be taken account of by allowing people who have worked 45 years to be able to continue to retire in the future at 65 years of age , " he said .
" in addition we should find ways of subsidizing pensions for people in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work until 67 . " so far , however , the government is resisting calls for exceptions for specific professions . employers are hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers see profits rising if they have to contribute less to pension funds germany 's powerful trade unions argue it 's been the government 's intention all along to use the increase in the retirement age to force unemployed elderly people into early retirement on reduced pension rates in order to save millions in state contributions to the creaking system . last year the government paid out 78 billion euros -lrb- $ 93.4 billion -rrb- , about 30 percent of government expenditure , to shore up the pensions system . but while workers are unhappy , german employers generally welcome the rise in retirement age .
they hope the move will lower non-wage labor costs : pensions contributions make up almost 20 percent of non-wage labor costs and are shared equally between employers and employees . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .

the meeting was chaired by health minister francesco storace and brought together health officials from puglia , calabria and sicily - the southern regions where the virus was found in migrating swans . the health official for puglia , alberto tedesco , told the meeting that strict control measures were already in place , ansa news agency reported .
another expert attending the meeting , antonio limone , said the situation was " under control " in agricultural zones and on the markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of the virus storace said saturday that the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in a total of 21 dead swans , five of them with a virulent form . the european commission reacted calmly to the news that the virus had for the first time crossed into the 25-member bloc , after having previously infected birds as close as romania and killed four people in turkey . calmi n g co n sumer fears storace tried to calm fears by saying that no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
but hospitals in sicily said they would test patients showing flu symptoms to determine the type of infection . five chickens found dead near the sicilian town of caltanissetta were undergoing tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian officials say they 're safe to eat in a bid to calm possible consumer fears italian poultry lobby officials said their " products are undergoing the most severe tests in europe . " greek poultry farmers also stressed that bird flu detected near the northern city of salonika saturday among three wild swans " does not concern farm birds . "
but authorities and ornithologists fear that more birds may be infected with the lethal avian flu after swans fleeing an exceptionally severe european winter were found dead on the territory . a greek official on saturday called on citizens not to panic but to observe simple health precautions . more cases expected yannis tsougrakis of the salonika region 's ornithological union told afp that the number of swans in the evros -lrb- meric in turkey -rrb- river delta , greece 's largest waterbody on the northeastern border with turkey , had risen from 830 in mid-january to 11,000 at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , inspectors found no evidence of bird flu in greece " after the unexpected arrival of waterbirds - the main carriers of the virus - fleeing the recent cold snap in northern europe , it was more than likely that the h5n1 virus would be detected in greece , " he said , predicting a rise of the caseload . but he also warned against dramatizing " as we have dead swans because of the cold and lack of food every year . " striking a reassuring note ornithologist thodoris kominos said that " few people currently live near the waterbodies so the risk of infection is small . " bulgaria which wants to join the european union next year said it was taking all precautionary measures to protect its people from an outbreak of bird flu after an eu reference laboratory saturday confirmed h5n1 in a wild swan found in the northwest of the country . new cases i n slove n ia the h5 bird flu virus has also been detected in a swan in eu member slovenia , eu officials said sunday . " the slovenian authorities today informed the european commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus h5 in a swan , " a statement issued by the eu 's executive branch . a slovenian laboratory made a first analysis and was sending samples to the eu reference laboratory for avian influenza in weybridge , england , for further tests , it added .
slovenia pledged to immediately apply the same precautionary measures as those set out in a commission decision adopted for greece and italy during the weekend . slovenian authorities are in close contact with their austrian counterparts , since the surveillance area crosses the slovenian-austrian border , the eu statement said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.02.2006 german study questions eco-friendliness of plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do trees and plants give up more greenhouse gas then they absorb ?
the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas . plants have long been seen as organisms that help to rid the globe of harmful carbon dioxide and , in turn , reduce the effects of cars , trucks and industrial plants .
but all may not be quite like that . scientists at germany 's max-planck-institute in heidelberg , germany , have found out that plants produce methane , considered one of the earth 's major greenhouse gases , which lock the sun 's energy inside the earth 's atmosphere . " we have made the discovery that plants under normal environmental conditions ... produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , " said frank keppler , who directed the research team 's laboratory studies .
" we have done rough calculations on a global scale and have estimated that it could be a really major source of atmospheric methane . " it has been widely held that methane gas is produced primarily in areas of low oxygen levels such as swamps and rice paddies where bacteria act upon vegetable matter .
farm animals like cows and sheep release gas as part of their digestive processes . a threat to carbon trading ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol allows countries to balance air pollution with tree planting or reforestation the discovery appears to threaten the principle of carbon trading , where greenhouse gas emissions can be balanced against tree planting or reforestation programs , a mainstay of the kyoto protocol environmental treaty . the max-planck-institute report brings agreements like the kyoto accord into question since the role of trees and other plants in pulling harmful carbon dioxide from the air may be countered by their methane production . " if it turns out that methane emissions are important here , that would then need to be monitored , " said halldor thorgeirsson , the deputy executive to the united nations climate change secretariat .
" and only when that has happened do we know how this will change the balance of the benefit of the forests to the protection of the climate . " but thorgeirsson advised caution when drawing conclusions from a study that raises questions about kyoto and whether forests produce more greenhouse gas then they capture . " the methods to actually quantify the emissions and remove also greenhouse gases are quite rigorous , " thorgeirsson said .
" we do have a process to actually take into account new scientific findings . " more research needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't give up yet the idea of adding more green to the yard or neighborhood thorgeirsson and keppler agreed that more research on plant-produced methane is needed on a broader scale and in the field in real-life environments .
keppler 's research team estimates that methane emissions from plants just slightly diminishes the effects of reforestation programs . " the climate benefits through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed that relatively small , negative effect , " keppler said . thorgeirrson said he expects the max-planck-institute study to trigger more research . " so far , this study does not fundamentally alter the way we look at forests , " he said .
" forests have a lot of other benefits in term of biodiversity , conservation , in terms of water recycling and a lot of other benefits , and one has to weigh all those benefits together .

2006 has already seen a number of allegations arise . it is 16 years since the notorious and hated stasi , the secret service apparatus of the communist former east germany , was disbanded as democracy once more embraced the eastern regions of a divided country .
time enough for a nation wounded and scarred by the actions of an oppressive agency which thrived on the fear of neighbor watching neighbor to heal .
or one would think . in fact , the shadow of the stasi continues to stretch and darken the land with what appears to be a gradual yet constant stream of allegations and scandals linked to prominent germans and their supposed dealings with the ddr 's secret service . the year is barely two months old and the list of the great and good who could have potentially been not so great and bad includes popular socialist politician gregor gysi , the olympic ice skating coach ingo steuer and public broadcaster ard 's sports journalist hagen bossdorf . gysi , one time leader of the former communist pds party and now joint leader of the renamed left wing alliance left party 's parliamentary group , finds himself the subject of on-going allegations that he once worked for the secret police .
these claims are nothing new .
gysi has successfully defended himself against such claims in court on numerous occasions . gysi vows to fight loose n i n g laws o n public access bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi wants reporters to be banned from accessing his files but now , investigations by journalists into the suspected stasi backgrounds of a number of prominent left party members , including gysi who made his name as a lawyer defending opponents of the communist regime which was toppled in 1989 , threatens to unearth damaging information . gysi wants to prevent journalists getting their hands on sensitive former stasi files which are currently declassified but not yet available to reporters or the public .
presently , files can only be viewed by the individual about whom the intelligence was compiled . marianne birthler , the official in charge of the files , wants the law changed to allow more transparency . " the public has a right to know which members of parliament worked for the ministry of state security , " birthler said , using the official name of the stasi . unlike gysi , there is no doubt about the secret service involvement of figure skating coach ingo steuer .
documents show that the former world champion pairs skater was employed by the stasi from 1985 to 1989 and spied on other athletes during that time . ice skati n g coach 's fate i n the bala n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer worked for the stasi for four years in the eighties steuer was initially dropped by the german national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- after the documents came to light but a berlin court overruled the decision and he will travel to the winter olympic games in turin as coach to aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy .
it is debatable whether he will be there to watch the pair when they compete as the nok intends to appeal the decision this week . steuer was one of 160 sportspeople investigated for possible stasi ties .
ski-jumping coach henry glass was also excluded from the german team for turin but has not contested the decision .
a third german official was also omitted although their identity has yet to be revealed . tour de fra n ce reporter de n ies stasi li n ks ard journalist bossdorf 's case went before a hamburg court after claims surfaced of his alleged involvement with the stasi while he was student .
the court at the time said that it could not suppress such reports coming out . it was left to bossdorf 's superiors to take action .
but after issuing a statement in december backing the journalist , no more has been said .
a further statement said that a decision would be made this month .
bossdorf has vehemently denied the allegations . marcel fürstenau -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach german figure-skating coach ingo steuer has been told he can now travel to the turin olympics after a berlin court ruled he been unfairly treated by the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- .

the inquiry into the crash concluded signal sn-109 was difficult to read in bright sunlight .
network rail said the signal had been repositioned and upgraded .
more than 400 people were also injured after a thames trains train went through a red light at ladbroke grove shortly after leaving paddington .
' persistent failure ' the train operated by recently-qualified driver michael hodder hit a cheltenham to paddington great western express on 5 october 1999 .
lord cullen 's report into the crash said there had been a " lamentable failure " by maintenance firm railtrack to respond to safety warnings on the stretch of track before the accident .
there was " a serious and persistent failure " by the company to look at how well signals could be sighted , the inquiry concluded .
we 've done everything we possibly can in terms of safety measures , to make sure such a tragic accident never happens again robin gisby , network rail robin gisby , director of operations at network rail , said it had taken on board all the recommendations from the enquiry .
he rejected criticisms from the train drivers unions , aslef , that there had not been enough consultation about the decision , saying the signal had passed necessary safety checks .
" obviously everybody 's deeply sorry about what happened at the time , bringing it back now , as i say , will improve the operational layout of paddington , " he said .
" we 've done everything we possibly can in terms of safety measures , to make sure such a tragic accident never happens again . "
chairman of the paddington survivors group , jonathan duckworth , told bbc 5 live that despite its central role in the crash , he was not opposed to the idea of the signal being brought back into use .
' move on ' he said : " initially your feelings are very strong , about the crash , about the fact that there was a signal that was difficult to see , that drivers did n't feel comfortable passing .
" but as long as all due process has been gone through , then i suppose our view is that the crash happened six years ago , and things have to move on from that . "
lord cullen also said the culture of safety in regard to the training of drivers was " slack and less than adequate " .
thames trains pleaded guilty to health and safety offences in 2004 and was fined £ 2m .
in november last year , the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- said network rail , which took over railtrack 's duties after the firm went into administration , would face criminal charges under the health and safety at work act .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- click -pipe- intel looks beyond the microchip bbc news / click graphics version bbc sport home click -pipe- about the programme -pipe- archive -pipe- buyers ' guides -pipe- inbox -pipe- meet the team -pipe- sunday , 12 february 2006 , 07:57 gmt intel looks beyond the microchip by spencer kelly click presenter intel 's new ceo , paul otellini , outlines new directions for a company best known for making computer chips . "
the direction in which our products are going and the markets that we serve are changing " paul otellini , intel ceo of all the companies in the technology community , intel has to have had the hardest job of selling itself .
it makes one of the smallest devices in the computer , which you never see , and which is probably one of the most technically complicated devices available to the consumer .
yet the vast majority of us know the manufacturer 's name - no mean feat .
when big computers roamed the earth there were only a small number of people involved in buying them ; they cost so much and were so specialised that only the richest of companies could have them .
so , like the mainframes that went before it , there was little clue as to what was inside and actually drove the first pc .
this was a relatively new device and the microprocessor was only 10 years old and almost unknown outside the hi-tech world .
however , by the late 1980s intel 's name was on millions of pc users ' lips , and , as the number of pcs in the world rumbled into the hundreds of millions , it was soon to be on the lips of more .
during the 1990s intel consolidated its position as the number one microprocessor manufacturer .
but 2006 sees major changes : new processors , a new logo , and a new ceo , paul otellini .
despite the new logo , mr otellini says the company has not fundamentally changed .
" we 're still a technology company , we 're still the world 's largest semi-conductor company .
" but the direction in which our products are going and the markets that we serve are changing .
we felt this was important enough a change to be able to signal that to the public at large .
" and today the whole marketing approach of the company , the product definition approach has to do with : what do consumers want to solve particular problems in their businesses , homes , healthcare etc .
" to do that we thought that we needed a different and fresher image . "
core product intel has tried to simplify the way we think of their chips , although it is not clear if it will work .
all microprocessor chips have a core .
the current intel core , the pentium , is on its way out , to be replaced by a new core , called " core " . "
consumers can select within a given family the best product to meet their needs " paul otellini , intel ceo it all sounds a bit like intel 's hijacking a technical term and trying to turn it into a brand name .
these new core chips come in two flavours .
solo core is a single core processor , and duo core is a dual core processor .
i can tell the difference between a celeron and a pentium , but if we have two solos side by side how are we going to be able to tell which is better than which ?
mr otellini says : " we have that same consideration today with our pentium line or other manufacturers ' lines .
" we provide - at least for the consumers who care - very detailed references of the specifications .
there will be a numbering scheme that suggests what are the features , what 's the speed , what 's the performance and so forth .
" so consumers can select within a given family the best product to meet their needs . "
entertaining future perhaps the biggest announcement from intel so far is the viiv standard .
viiv is less technology and more a shopping list of technologies .
aimed fair and square at the home entertainment market , it defines the latest generation of media centres that are capable of playing anything from mp3 songs to high-definition films .
one of the features of viiv is a very fast boot-up and switch on .
" we are not just a hardware company , " says mr otellini .
" we ship over one million lines of software with every microprocessor that goes out the door to be able to handle all of the functions around the microprocessor : the audio , the video , the graphics , and things like the power management .
" you see that every day in your notebook .
the notebook is very efficient at managing power .
" all we 've done with viiv is take some of those same power management techniques - instant on , instant resume - that we 've developed for mobile technology , and now we 're taking it in a different fashion to things for the living room .
in two to five years time , the typical home pc will , says mr otellini , still have the same basic functionality of a computer .
" it does all the things you do today with a consumer pc : internet access , storing digital media , videos , home music .
none of that is going to be different .
" what will be different is how you see it and where you see it .
" this technology allows us , instead of walking up to that two-foot screen on your computer in your den or kitchen or wherever you have it , to sit in the comfort of your living room with a single remote .
" you can access not only all the content that was on your machine in pc mode , but also you 'll be able to go on to the internet and bring down this premium content , mostly high-definition , and enjoy that on the big screen in the house , and move it around the house . "

the direction in which our products are going and the markets that we serve are changing paul otellini , intel ceo of all the companies in the technology community , intel has to have had the hardest job of selling itself .
it makes one of the smallest devices in the computer , which you never see , and which is probably one of the most technically complicated devices available to the consumer .
yet the vast majority of us know the manufacturer 's name - no mean feat .
when big computers roamed the earth there were only a small number of people involved in buying them ; they cost so much and were so specialised that only the richest of companies could have them .
so , like the mainframes that went before it , there was little clue as to what was inside and actually drove the first pc .
this was a relatively new device and the microprocessor was only 10 years old and almost unknown outside the hi-tech world .
however , by the late 1980s intel 's name was on millions of pc users ' lips , and , as the number of pcs in the world rumbled into the hundreds of millions , it was soon to be on the lips of more .
during the 1990s intel consolidated its position as the number one microprocessor manufacturer .
but 2006 sees major changes : new processors , a new logo , and a new ceo , paul otellini .
despite the new logo , mr otellini says the company has not fundamentally changed .
" we 're still a technology company , we 're still the world 's largest semi-conductor company .
" but the direction in which our products are going and the markets that we serve are changing .
we felt this was important enough a change to be able to signal that to the public at large .
" and today the whole marketing approach of the company , the product definition approach has to do with : what do consumers want to solve particular problems in their businesses , homes , healthcare etc .
" to do that we thought that we needed a different and fresher image . "
core product intel has tried to simplify the way we think of their chips , although it is not clear if it will work .
all microprocessor chips have a core .
the current intel core , the pentium , is on its way out , to be replaced by a new core , called " core " .
consumers can select within a given family the best product to meet their needs paul otellini , intel ceo it all sounds a bit like intel 's hijacking a technical term and trying to turn it into a brand name .
these new core chips come in two flavours .
solo core is a single core processor , and duo core is a dual core processor .
i can tell the difference between a celeron and a pentium , but if we have two solos side by side how are we going to be able to tell which is better than which ?
mr otellini says : " we have that same consideration today with our pentium line or other manufacturers ' lines .
" we provide - at least for the consumers who care - very detailed references of the specifications .
there will be a numbering scheme that suggests what are the features , what 's the speed , what 's the performance and so forth .
" so consumers can select within a given family the best product to meet their needs . "
entertaining future perhaps the biggest announcement from intel so far is the viiv standard .
viiv is less technology and more a shopping list of technologies .
aimed fair and square at the home entertainment market , it defines the latest generation of media centres that are capable of playing anything from mp3 songs to high-definition films .
one of the features of viiv is a very fast boot-up and switch on .
" we are not just a hardware company , " says mr otellini .

no , says technology commentator bill thompson .
the net should be like a canal and not care about what travels on it one of those loud and angry debates that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the world is currently playing out in the us .
the senate committee on commerce , science and transportation is considering making changes to the 1996 telecommunications act , and one of the ideas being floated is that network providers should be allowed to offer preferential service to some of their customers instead of providing a neutral data carrier service .
back in 2004 , michael powell , at the time chairman of the federal communications commission , said that net service firms should support " network freedom " and ensure that their users could access all lawful content and attach whatever devices they want to their network connection without any discrimination .
now some of the big telecoms companies want to be able to sell premium services for things like streaming video or voice over ip , and some people are worried that this will eventually lead to a segregated internet .
they include lawrence lessig , law professor at stanford university , founder of the creative commons and one of the most significant and influential thinkers about the future of the network we have been building for the past 30 years .
it 's a big issue .
after all , once we get away from the idea that the pipes just move bits around without really caring what data is being transmitted , it 's a small step to discriminating against some forms of content and then targeting specific sites , services or users .
instead of an " end-to-end " network , we would end up with something more like the phone network , along with a complicated array of charging schemes for " 0800 " , " 0845 " and " 0871 " sites .
those in favour of " network neutrality " and keeping the current model of the internet as just a data conduit include big hitters such as google , ebay , amazon and even microsoft .
they know it will cost them more if they have to pay to get their video delivered to users .
the phone and cable companies want to be free to charge for new services and make more money , and they argue that it 's not up to the government what they do with their networks .
policy echo this might not seem to matter to the rest of us , since the us no longer has the majority of network users , but of course business practices , technologies and even laws made over there tend to have a disproportionate impact on the rest of the world so we should pay attention .
social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
bill thompson we 've already seen how the digital millennium copyright act , a us law designed to protect the interests of large media organisations , resulted in the appallingly restrictive eu copyright directive .
we do n't want anything like that to happen this time .
this debate is happening now largely thanks to the internet 's astonishing success .
the earliest packet-switched network connections , the ones that made up the early arpanet back in the late 1960s , used telephone lines to transmit data between university campuses in california and ohio .
but they used the network in the way that canal boats use water .
a canal has no idea what is being carried in the narrow boats , and it does n't really care .
until the 1990 's the phone companies did n't really know or care what data was going over the leased lines they sold .
when dial-up access started to take off , there was a flurry of activity and attempts at control , all of which failed .
however , now all the telcos run their own networks using internet technologies and internet protocols and they want a piece of the action .
charging differently for different content is not the same as turning the net into a toll road , open to all for a fee .
we already have that : if you choose to pay more you can have a fast broadband connection to your home ; if you choose to pay vast amounts of money you can stream large amounts of data like google or the bbc does .
justice call what is being proposed is more like building two roads into every town and up to every house , one smooth and well-maintained tarmac and the other a dirt track , and then letting tesco and waitrose bid for the right to use the good road .
previous attempts to set up a two-tier net have failed this issue just the latest round of a long-running debate about how much government - of whatever type , in whatever country - should be involved in the growth and development of the internet .
some , mostly libertarian conservative thinkers like those at the cato institute , instinctively oppose any and all regulation and want the free market to determine what services are offered , at what price and to whom .
even those who remember that the net emerged from a publicly-funded attempt to build a high-speed data network choose to claim that the days of subsidy are now over and that only deregulation can offer real benefits , both to companies and to the wider society .
for them , any attempt to restrict the telephone companies ' freedom to offer preferential service is tantamount to state socialism and one step away from a communist revolution .
of course they are wrong , and badly so .
i 'm a market socialist , and i believe that regulated markets are the best way to create social value .
i have also been using the net since 1985 and i have seen it evolve and grow thanks to the balance between regulation and market forces .
that balance has to be maintained .
social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
markets fail , and they do so in ways that any humane society must address .
ensuring that network access is available to all and that the network itself carries all lawful traffic is the only way forward .
we must just hope that the us government recognises that this is the case , and sets a good example to the rest of the world .

social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
bill thompson we 've already seen how the digital millennium copyright act , a us law designed to protect the interests of large media organisations , resulted in the appallingly restrictive eu copyright directive .
we do n't want anything like that to happen this time .
this debate is happening now largely thanks to the internet 's astonishing success .
the earliest packet-switched network connections , the ones that made up the early arpanet back in the late 1960s , used telephone lines to transmit data between university campuses in california and ohio .
but they used the network in the way that canal boats use water .
a canal has no idea what is being carried in the narrow boats , and it does n't really care .
until the 1990 's the phone companies did n't really know or care what data was going over the leased lines they sold .
when dial-up access started to take off , there was a flurry of activity and attempts at control , all of which failed .
however , now all the telcos run their own networks using internet technologies and internet protocols and they want a piece of the action .
charging differently for different content is not the same as turning the net into a toll road , open to all for a fee .
we already have that : if you choose to pay more you can have a fast broadband connection to your home ; if you choose to pay vast amounts of money you can stream large amounts of data like google or the bbc does .
justice call what is being proposed is more like building two roads into every town and up to every house , one smooth and well-maintained tarmac and the other a dirt track , and then letting tesco and waitrose bid for the right to use the good road .
previous attempts to set up a two-tier net have failed this issue just the latest round of a long-running debate about how much government - of whatever type , in whatever country - should be involved in the growth and development of the internet .
some , mostly libertarian conservative thinkers like those at the cato institute , instinctively oppose any and all regulation and want the free market to determine what services are offered , at what price and to whom .
even those who remember that the net emerged from a publicly-funded attempt to build a high-speed data network choose to claim that the days of subsidy are now over and that only deregulation can offer real benefits , both to companies and to the wider society .
for them , any attempt to restrict the telephone companies ' freedom to offer preferential service is tantamount to state socialism and one step away from a communist revolution .
of course they are wrong , and badly so .
i 'm a market socialist , and i believe that regulated markets are the best way to create social value .
i have also been using the net since 1985 and i have seen it evolve and grow thanks to the balance between regulation and market forces .
that balance has to be maintained .
social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
markets fail , and they do so in ways that any humane society must address .
ensuring that network access is available to all and that the network itself carries all lawful traffic is the only way forward .
we must just hope that the us government recognises that this is the case , and sets a good example to the rest of the world .

no , says technology commentator bill thompson .
the net should be like a canal and not care about what travels on it one of those loud and angry debates that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the world is currently playing out in the us .
the senate committee on commerce , science and transportation is considering making changes to the 1996 telecommunications act , and one of the ideas being floated is that network providers should be allowed to offer preferential service to some of their customers instead of providing a neutral data carrier service .
back in 2004 , michael powell , at the time chairman of the federal communications commission , said that net service firms should support " network freedom " and ensure that their users could access all lawful content and attach whatever devices they want to their network connection without any discrimination .
now some of the big telecoms companies want to be able to sell premium services for things like streaming video or voice over ip , and some people are worried that this will eventually lead to a segregated internet .
they include lawrence lessig , law professor at stanford university , founder of the creative commons and one of the most significant and influential thinkers about the future of the network we have been building for the past 30 years .
it 's a big issue .
after all , once we get away from the idea that the pipes just move bits around without really caring what data is being transmitted , it 's a small step to discriminating against some forms of content and then targeting specific sites , services or users .
instead of an " end-to-end " network , we would end up with something more like the phone network , along with a complicated array of charging schemes for " 0800 " , " 0845 " and " 0871 " sites .
those in favour of " network neutrality " and keeping the current model of the internet as just a data conduit include big hitters such as google , ebay , amazon and even microsoft .
they know it will cost them more if they have to pay to get their video delivered to users .

previous attempts to set up a two-tier net have failed this issue just the latest round of a long-running debate about how much government - of whatever type , in whatever country - should be involved in the growth and development of the internet .
some , mostly libertarian conservative thinkers like those at the cato institute , instinctively oppose any and all regulation and want the free market to determine what services are offered , at what price and to whom .
even those who remember that the net emerged from a publicly-funded attempt to build a high-speed data network choose to claim that the days of subsidy are now over and that only deregulation can offer real benefits , both to companies and to the wider society .
for them , any attempt to restrict the telephone companies ' freedom to offer preferential service is tantamount to state socialism and one step away from a communist revolution .
of course they are wrong , and badly so .
i 'm a market socialist , and i believe that regulated markets are the best way to create social value .
i have also been using the net since 1985 and i have seen it evolve and grow thanks to the balance between regulation and market forces .
that balance has to be maintained .
social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
markets fail , and they do so in ways that any humane society must address .
ensuring that network access is available to all and that the network itself carries all lawful traffic is the only way forward .
we must just hope that the us government recognises that this is the case , and sets a good example to the rest of the world .

the five-tonne rock is a gift from the people of the falklands to welsh veterans of the 1982 conflict .
on sunday it was transported on the last leg of the journey by part-time soldiers from a ta regiment .
it is hoped the stone will form the centrepiece of a veterans ' memorial to mark the 25th anniversary of the war .
falklands veteran andy ' curly ' jones found the stone at the base of mount harriet , near the falklands ' capital stanley on a visit to the islands last march .
soldiers helped start the stone on its journey to wales mr jones , a former welsh guardsman and secretary of the south atlantic medal association in wales -lrb- sama wales -rrb- , said : " i went back always with the intention of bringing a rock back home to wales .
" but it was n't until the last day just before we flew back that the rock appeared .
" i think it was like music and lights ... the clouds parted and there it was a perfect shape " .
the rock which stands seven foot high and almost the same distance in width is destined to be the centrepiece of a memorial which will honour all 250 from the uk forces who died in the falklands war .
remember the stone was situated at the base of mount harriet , a famous battle site where welsh guards secured the start line for the british attack , and was moved from there by members of the armed forces now stationed on the islands .
on sunday around 70 veterans of the conflict will gather at brecon when the stone is brought on the last leg of its journey from southampton by soldiers in the royal logistics corps based at maindy barracks in cardiff .
mr jones said it was hoped that the memorial with a plinth made of welsh slate would eventually be erected at a site in cardiff in time for the 25th anniversary of the conflict in 2007 .
" it will commemorate the involvement of the taskforce but more than that its hoped it will be somewhere that wives , mothers , and girlfriends can remember all the boys who did not come home , " he said .
