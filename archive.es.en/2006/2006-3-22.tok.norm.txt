but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .

germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is a conservative islamic country and 99 percent of its citizens are muslims it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations . an afghan judge said on sunday that 40-year-old abdul rahman had been jailed for converting from islam to christianity and could face the death penalty if he refused to become a muslim again .
under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and italy defend afghan christian convert italy and germany , nato countries with troops in afghanistan , have expressed urgent concern to the kabul government about reports that an afghan convert to christianity faced the death penalty there .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .

each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .

the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

no , folks , it 's not a bit of spam that has appeared in e-mail boxes : it 's real-life sex help for a horse . a court in the small eastern german town of neuruppin ordered viagra to be given to a stallion after his new owner claimed the horse was impotent and refused to pay the full asking price for the animal .
the buyer of the horse called " vedor " paid just a tenth of the price of over 4,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,900 -rrb- , claiming the animal had only one testicle and had failed to get friendly with a female pony .
after examining the horse closely , a veterinarian discovered the testicle , said egbert simons , a spokesman for the neuruppin court .
and , lo and behold : once the stallion was given the potency drug viagra , he was up and raring to go .
it soon became evident that the horse was fully functional , the spokesman added .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

the buyer of the horse called " vedor " paid just a tenth of the price of over 4,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,900 -rrb- , claiming the animal had only one testicle and had failed to get friendly with a female pony .
after examining the horse closely , a veterinarian discovered the testicle , said egbert simons , a spokesman for the neuruppin court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is a conservative islamic country and 99 percent of its citizens are muslims it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations . an afghan judge said on sunday that 40-year-old abdul rahman had been jailed for converting from islam to christianity and could face the death penalty if he refused to become a muslim again .
under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .

" the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits .

" the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

" german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country . " christians have few rights in some islamic countries , notably saudi arabia and pakistan .
this has become an increasingly sore point in europe , where muslim communities are growing rapidly and demanding rights and respect . human rights and fundamental freedoms a statement released by the italian foreign ministry said : " italy will move at the highest level ... to prevent something which is incompatible with the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians from both the coalition and the opposition oppose the mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word . the deployment of a european union force to safeguard a series of elections in the democratic republic of congo this summer is becoming ever more likely after a number of eu countries said they would make troops available , and germany agreed to take a leadership role .
but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .
" arguments that the eu wants to stabilize the drc and that european credibility is at stake simply do n't go together with the deployment of just 1,500 troops , of which only about 700 will actually be based in kinshasa . " germa n comma n d i n potsdam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said germany is ready to lead at least 10 eu countries are expected to take part in the congo mission with germany and france making up the bulk of the force , contributing 500 troops each .
germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is a conservative islamic country and 99 percent of its citizens are muslims it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations . an afghan judge said on sunday that 40-year-old abdul rahman had been jailed for converting from islam to christianity and could face the death penalty if he refused to become a muslim again .
under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .

" so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch .

instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .

" but we are missing about a dozen players , " germany and the united states last met at the 2002 world cup quarter-final , which germany won 1-0 before losing to brazil in the final . while anything less than a repeat performance will leave klinsmann hoping the 11,000 t-shirts being giving away will suffice to keep fans from calling for his resignation , arena stressed that both teams are still in the calm before the world cup storm .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .

i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .

that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .

" german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country . " christians have few rights in some islamic countries , notably saudi arabia and pakistan .
this has become an increasingly sore point in europe , where muslim communities are growing rapidly and demanding rights and respect . human rights and fundamental freedoms a statement released by the italian foreign ministry said : " italy will move at the highest level ... to prevent something which is incompatible with the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians from both the coalition and the opposition oppose the mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word . the deployment of a european union force to safeguard a series of elections in the democratic republic of congo this summer is becoming ever more likely after a number of eu countries said they would make troops available , and germany agreed to take a leadership role .
but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .
" arguments that the eu wants to stabilize the drc and that european credibility is at stake simply do n't go together with the deployment of just 1,500 troops , of which only about 700 will actually be based in kinshasa . " germa n comma n d i n potsdam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said germany is ready to lead at least 10 eu countries are expected to take part in the congo mission with germany and france making up the bulk of the force , contributing 500 troops each .
germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch . " it 's a big deal to these people , " said american defender steve cherundolo , who plays for hanover in the bundesliga .
" they take it very seriously , as they should , and things have n't gone well the past year and a half . " us coach bruce arena said he would n't be able field his strongest side because of injuries and europe-based players whose club teams wo n't release them for the friendly .
instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .
" the german team will be prepared to play their best against us and this will be an incredible challenge for our players . " us experience comes from bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us goalkeeper kasey keller three germany-based americans , including goalkeeper kasey keller , who will provide added experience to a group of players lacking experience together . " it would be extreme to call this a b-team , " keller told reporters monday .
" but we are missing about a dozen players , " germany and the united states last met at the 2002 world cup quarter-final , which germany won 1-0 before losing to brazil in the final . while anything less than a repeat performance will leave klinsmann hoping the 11,000 t-shirts being giving away will suffice to keep fans from calling for his resignation , arena stressed that both teams are still in the calm before the world cup storm . " i think in the big picture , a result in this game is n't critical for either team , " arena said .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .

" so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch . " it 's a big deal to these people , " said american defender steve cherundolo , who plays for hanover in the bundesliga .
" they take it very seriously , as they should , and things have n't gone well the past year and a half . " us coach bruce arena said he would n't be able field his strongest side because of injuries and europe-based players whose club teams wo n't release them for the friendly .
instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .
" the german team will be prepared to play their best against us and this will be an incredible challenge for our players . " us experience comes from bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us goalkeeper kasey keller three germany-based americans , including goalkeeper kasey keller , who will provide added experience to a group of players lacking experience together . " it would be extreme to call this a b-team , " keller told reporters monday .
" but we are missing about a dozen players , " germany and the united states last met at the 2002 world cup quarter-final , which germany won 1-0 before losing to brazil in the final . while anything less than a repeat performance will leave klinsmann hoping the 11,000 t-shirts being giving away will suffice to keep fans from calling for his resignation , arena stressed that both teams are still in the calm before the world cup storm . " i think in the big picture , a result in this game is n't critical for either team , " arena said .
" the goal is to have your team ready for the opening game of the world cup .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2006 design contest showcases fashion with a message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes as a political statement who says fashion has to be frivolous ?
a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?
the trend in germany these days is to talk capitalism down , but what if you could invest only in socially responsible companies and still turn a profit ?
" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out .
-lrb- june 22 , 2005 -rrb- giving even when it hurts germans may be hard hit by their struggling economy , but they do n't cut corners when it comes to charitable giving .

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : interviews with the stars oliver kahn : germany can win the soccer world cup us counting on fan support in kaiserslautern " klinsmann has put together a good team " " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.03.2006 us goalie : pressure will be on european teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 36 , keller is the oldest players on the us roster us goalie kasey keller told dw-world.de about the benefit of experience , the difficulty of judging the world 's top keepers and how the us team will deal with two european opponents playing close to home in group stage . currently a regular fixture between the posts for the bundesliga 's borussia mönchengladbach , keller is one of the us team 's most internationally experienced players , having played in england and spain before settling down in germany .
keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .

i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 report : german firms involved in illegal arms exports to iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms have allegedly been supplying parts for iran 's missiles even as tensions simmer between iran and the west over teheran 's nuclear program , security sources in germany say around 100 dummy firms are illegally exporting arms to the islamic country . speaking to german public broadcaster ard on monday , security experts confirmed that as many as up to 100 dummy firms in germany are involved in illegally exporting components for missiles and aircraft to iran . johannes schmalzl , president of the office for the protection of the constitution in the state of baden-württemberg , told the program " report mainz " that the situation was n't entirely new . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plutonium tablets at a nuclear facility in germany " we 've been devoting time to the topic since 2002 , " he said .
" and we 've concluded that an estimated 100 dummy firms in germany are involved in it . " schmalzl added that the authorities could hardly keep up with the scale of illegal exports to iran . " when i say , 100 dummy firms , you can imagine that when we discover one and the federal prosecutor opens a case against them , we 're happy and pat ourselves on the back .
but 99 others are still in business , " schmalzl said . shopping for illegal arms the television program reported that most of the exports were designed to refine and perfect iran 's missile program , which is widely considered a key part of teheran 's ambitions to establish itself as a serious nuclear and military power .
many say it would pose a direct threat to israel . according to the station , for years iran has been sending agents on shopping trips to europe and to germany in order to improve the reach and precision of their missiles . most of the iranian spies disguised the arms exports through a maze of trade firms and distributions points both within iran and abroad .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .
" arguments that the eu wants to stabilize the drc and that european credibility is at stake simply do n't go together with the deployment of just 1,500 troops , of which only about 700 will actually be based in kinshasa . " germa n comma n d i n potsdam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said germany is ready to lead at least 10 eu countries are expected to take part in the congo mission with germany and france making up the bulk of the force , contributing 500 troops each .
germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "

and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2006 german music biz hit by pirates for seventh straight year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany illegal copying and downloading is again to blame for the german music industry 's failure to recover from its slump .
figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch .

instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .

" but we are missing about a dozen players , " germany and the united states last met at the 2002 world cup quarter-final , which germany won 1-0 before losing to brazil in the final . while anything less than a repeat performance will leave klinsmann hoping the 11,000 t-shirts being giving away will suffice to keep fans from calling for his resignation , arena stressed that both teams are still in the calm before the world cup storm .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .
he needs a foreign troop presence in his country to defend against al qaeda and taliban remnants . religious freedom " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the daily bild .
the newspaper said rahman had converted to christianity while he lived in germany for nine years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul says she 's contact hamid karzai directly wieczorek-zeul said she would make a direct appeal to karzai . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed " deep concern " and said he would also intervene if necessary .
berlin 's embassy in kabul was " in close contact with the afghan side " on this , he told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . religious voices weighed in as well .
germany 's top catholic prelate , cardinal karl lehmann , described the case against rahman as " an alarming signal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the german bishops ' conference solemnly demands that christians in afghanistan be able to practice their faith openly and freely and that conversion to christianity must be possible without any disadvantages , " he said in a statement . " german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country . " christians have few rights in some islamic countries , notably saudi arabia and pakistan .
this has become an increasingly sore point in europe , where muslim communities are growing rapidly and demanding rights and respect . human rights and fundamental freedoms a statement released by the italian foreign ministry said : " italy will move at the highest level ... to prevent something which is incompatible with the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment .

" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team .

instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?
the trend in germany these days is to talk capitalism down , but what if you could invest only in socially responsible companies and still turn a profit ?
" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out .

no , folks , it 's not a bit of spam that has appeared in e-mail boxes : it 's real-life sex help for a horse . a court in the small eastern german town of neuruppin ordered viagra to be given to a stallion after his new owner claimed the horse was impotent and refused to pay the full asking price for the animal .

after examining the horse closely , a veterinarian discovered the testicle , said egbert simons , a spokesman for the neuruppin court .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch . " it 's a big deal to these people , " said american defender steve cherundolo , who plays for hanover in the bundesliga .
" they take it very seriously , as they should , and things have n't gone well the past year and a half . " us coach bruce arena said he would n't be able field his strongest side because of injuries and europe-based players whose club teams wo n't release them for the friendly .
instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .
" the german team will be prepared to play their best against us and this will be an incredible challenge for our players .

" but we are missing about a dozen players , " germany and the united states last met at the 2002 world cup quarter-final , which germany won 1-0 before losing to brazil in the final . while anything less than a repeat performance will leave klinsmann hoping the 11,000 t-shirts being giving away will suffice to keep fans from calling for his resignation , arena stressed that both teams are still in the calm before the world cup storm .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .

obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : interviews with the stars oliver kahn : germany can win the soccer world cup us counting on fan support in kaiserslautern " klinsmann has put together a good team " " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.03.2006 us goalie : pressure will be on european teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 36 , keller is the oldest players on the us roster us goalie kasey keller told dw-world.de about the benefit of experience , the difficulty of judging the world 's top keepers and how the us team will deal with two european opponents playing close to home in group stage . currently a regular fixture between the posts for the bundesliga 's borussia mönchengladbach , keller is one of the us team 's most internationally experienced players , having played in england and spain before settling down in germany .
keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

" and we 've concluded that an estimated 100 dummy firms in germany are involved in it . " schmalzl added that the authorities could hardly keep up with the scale of illegal exports to iran . " when i say , 100 dummy firms , you can imagine that when we discover one and the federal prosecutor opens a case against them , we 're happy and pat ourselves on the back .
but 99 others are still in business , " schmalzl said . shopping for illegal arms the television program reported that most of the exports were designed to refine and perfect iran 's missile program , which is widely considered a key part of teheran 's ambitions to establish itself as a serious nuclear and military power .
many say it would pose a direct threat to israel . according to the station , for years iran has been sending agents on shopping trips to europe and to germany in order to improve the reach and precision of their missiles . most of the iranian spies disguised the arms exports through a maze of trade firms and distributions points both within iran and abroad .
according to german authorities , such networks served to mislead authorities and facilitate the illegal exports .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .

" so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .
that 's been a big factor is why i 'm still able to play as well as i have been at the age that i am . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian keeper gianluigi buffon may improve with age what do you think of the other two keepers in your group ? i have a lot of respect for both of them .
obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .
i think in the past experience was a factor .
i think petr cech will be a better goalkeeper at 30 than he is right now if he stays fit and healthy , there 's no question . who do you think is a better , cech or buffon ? it all comes down to form at the time .
when you start to talk about the top 10 or 20 goalkeepers in the world everything rotates .
nobody is playing in the same league so it 's hard to really judge . perhaps the world cup is a better place to judge ? it would be just who was better at that world cup .
a lot of it depends on how your team is playing around you .
how far you go in the tournament and keep doing well .
a lot of the time goalkeepers can have a great game and lose 2-0 .
look at our game the other day , the bielefeld keeper had a great game ; i did n't have very much to do .
but he lost and i won .
that 's the way it goes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany eliminated the usa at the 2002 world cup what 's the secret ?
how do you keep your form so well ? experience is a lot .
i 'm very happy with the training i 'm getting with uwe kamps , my goalkeeping coach here at borussia , which definitely helps .
i 'm staying fit , have good training and the experience to not get into bad situations very often - that comes with a lot of games . there are some top strikers in the czech and italian teams .
have you ever played against any of them ? italy i 've played against a few times at different times in my career .
obviously , the strikers change . some of the czech players are playing in germany , so i 've played against several of their players as well . but once again , it 's down to how well are my defenders going to be playing against those players , what opportunities are they going to have .
i feel confident with the players i have in front of me . people say your group is the " group of death , " and most people would choose italy and the czech republic to advance , so there is comparatively less pressure for the us team . it 's a tough group .
i think with the tournament being in europe , statistically over the years , european teams have done better in the tournaments held in europe . we know playing against two big european teams the pressure will be on them .
we have enough pride in our own ability that we feel we can get through this group as well . in your opinion , what is the us team 's most powerful weapon ? we 're a team .
we 're not based on one individual holding up our team for us .
we feel that we will work extremely hard , we 're fast , and we 'll work as a team and fight for everything . qu xiao interviewed kasey keller -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england " roque santa cruz is a household name in the bundesliga and his home country but hopes to take that fame to the next level at the world cup .

as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .

obviously buffon has been around a bit longer ; cech is younger and had a great season last year for chelsea .
i think they are two of the top goalkeepers in the world . are goalkeepers better after they reach 30 ? it 's definitely changing a little bit .

" and we 've concluded that an estimated 100 dummy firms in germany are involved in it . " schmalzl added that the authorities could hardly keep up with the scale of illegal exports to iran . " when i say , 100 dummy firms , you can imagine that when we discover one and the federal prosecutor opens a case against them , we 're happy and pat ourselves on the back .
but 99 others are still in business , " schmalzl said . shopping for illegal arms the television program reported that most of the exports were designed to refine and perfect iran 's missile program , which is widely considered a key part of teheran 's ambitions to establish itself as a serious nuclear and military power .
many say it would pose a direct threat to israel . according to the station , for years iran has been sending agents on shopping trips to europe and to germany in order to improve the reach and precision of their missiles . most of the iranian spies disguised the arms exports through a maze of trade firms and distributions points both within iran and abroad .
according to german authorities , such networks served to mislead authorities and facilitate the illegal exports . " we 're talking about companies made up one to three persons who do n't necessarily produce anything themselves but rather order something from the producers and then conceal where the stuff is going , " karl-heinz matthias , president of the federal customs office , told ard . german exports not meant for iran alone even as the standoff between iran and the international community over teheran 's alleged covert nuclear program continues , experts point out that iran 's missile program has never been a secret . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the " father of the pakistani bomb " " a country , which like iran intensively works on missiles , only does this in order to be able to put nuclear weapons on the missiles , " oliver thränert of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told the television station .
" iran is certainly far removed from that , but in the end , iran 's goal seems to be to fire nuclear weapons with its missiles . " however , german firms ' involvement in illegal arms exports is not confined to iran alone .
since the 1980s , german firms and middlemen , along with counterparts in other european countries , have been suspected of smuggling nuclear technology to regimes in pakistan and north korea . last friday , a court in mannheim began hearing the case of a german engineer accused of aiding libya 's nuclear program and being involved with the global nuclear mafia run by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment . " i take this job very seriously , " he told a group of journalists , before pointing out that it 's the games in this summer 's world cup that will mean the most .
" if we win our first two games , everyone will try to jump on our train , but the train will have left already . " but even germany 's soccer aficionado and president of the 2006 world cup organizing committee franz beckenbauer said he thinks germany needs to starting seeing results soon because " time is running out . " " it 's a very important game for us , " said german midfielder and sometimes captain michael ballack .
" it 's a decisive game for our confidence , for the mood in the team . " us aware of pressure on germany the american competition also knows they 'll be entering a highly-charged domestic atmosphere when they take to the pitch . " it 's a big deal to these people , " said american defender steve cherundolo , who plays for hanover in the bundesliga .
" they take it very seriously , as they should , and things have n't gone well the past year and a half . " us coach bruce arena said he would n't be able field his strongest side because of injuries and europe-based players whose club teams wo n't release them for the friendly .
instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up .

but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .
" arguments that the eu wants to stabilize the drc and that european credibility is at stake simply do n't go together with the deployment of just 1,500 troops , of which only about 700 will actually be based in kinshasa . " germa n comma n d i n potsdam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said germany is ready to lead at least 10 eu countries are expected to take part in the congo mission with germany and france making up the bulk of the force , contributing 500 troops each .
germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .

each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .

among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

" germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .
" no one in germany will end up starving under bridges , but the state can no longer keep the promise it once made to guarantee individual living standards for pensioners .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there .

" the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?
the trend in germany these days is to talk capitalism down , but what if you could invest only in socially responsible companies and still turn a profit ?
" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out .
-lrb- june 22 , 2005 -rrb- giving even when it hurts germans may be hard hit by their struggling economy , but they do n't cut corners when it comes to charitable giving .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "
ce n turies of traditio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingeborg schäuble ingeborg schäuble , chairwoman of german agro action , is well aware that where politics can be divisive , fashion can be bonding .
and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .
in many of these countries clothes and textiles are rooted in traditions that go back centuries and it 's a fascinating topic to explore . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

kahn , winning his 84th cap , has been embroiled in a long battle with arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann for the number one jersey for the world cup finals . kahn 's save was vital as it stopped the vistors from levelling at 1-1 but thereafter germany took control scoring three times in six minutes . oliver neuville , an outside bet for a place in klinsmann 's final squad , curled a brilliant volley past borussia mönchengladbach team-mate kasey keller to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes . the inexperienced us defence collapsed with miroslav klose netting in the 75th minute and captain michael ballack was on target four minutes later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , struggles with cory gibbs from the us team it was a slightly flattering scoreline , although steve cherundolo scored late on to put the us on the score sheet , but that did not bother klinsmann or the bulk of the 66,000 fans at dortmund 's westfalen stadium . dortmund charmed germany have now won 12 of their 13 matches in dortmund , which is turning into something of a fortress for the national team .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

" german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country .

but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .

germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2006 germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is a conservative islamic country and 99 percent of its citizens are muslims it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations . an afghan judge said on sunday that 40-year-old abdul rahman had been jailed for converting from islam to christianity and could face the death penalty if he refused to become a muslim again .
under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and italy defend afghan christian convert italy and germany , nato countries with troops in afghanistan , have expressed urgent concern to the kabul government about reports that an afghan convert to christianity faced the death penalty there .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .
he needs a foreign troop presence in his country to defend against al qaeda and taliban remnants . religious freedom " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the daily bild .
the newspaper said rahman had converted to christianity while he lived in germany for nine years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul says she 's contact hamid karzai directly wieczorek-zeul said she would make a direct appeal to karzai . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed " deep concern " and said he would also intervene if necessary .
berlin 's embassy in kabul was " in close contact with the afghan side " on this , he told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . religious voices weighed in as well .
germany 's top catholic prelate , cardinal karl lehmann , described the case against rahman as " an alarming signal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the german bishops ' conference solemnly demands that christians in afghanistan be able to practice their faith openly and freely and that conversion to christianity must be possible without any disadvantages , " he said in a statement . " german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country . " christians have few rights in some islamic countries , notably saudi arabia and pakistan .
this has become an increasingly sore point in europe , where muslim communities are growing rapidly and demanding rights and respect . human rights and fundamental freedoms a statement released by the italian foreign ministry said : " italy will move at the highest level ... to prevent something which is incompatible with the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan supreme court judge ansarullah mawlavezada holds a bible in kabul former president cossiga wrote an open letter to prime minister silvio berlusconi and urged him to withdraw italian troops from afghanistan unless kabul ensures rahman 's safety . " it is not acceptable that our soldiers should put themselves at risk or even sacrifice their lives for a fundamentalist , illiberal regime , " cossiga wrote . afghanistan is a conservative islamic country and 99 per cent of its more than 25 million people are muslim .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .

" german bishops will try to ensure christians in islamic countries enjoy the same rights as muslims have in our country . " christians have few rights in some islamic countries , notably saudi arabia and pakistan .
this has become an increasingly sore point in europe , where muslim communities are growing rapidly and demanding rights and respect . human rights and fundamental freedoms a statement released by the italian foreign ministry said : " italy will move at the highest level ... to prevent something which is incompatible with the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .

" i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .

germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

but the mission must still be approved by the german parliament , where reaching agreement among lawmakers appears to be far from a done deal.while for chancellor angela merkel , the mission to the drc is symbolic of europe ’ s determination to help africa , this noble aim has not been embraced by a substantial number of parliamentarians .
bernd siebert , a conservative member of the bundestag 's defense committee , said that skepticism prevails even among the military experts in parliament . " i do n't know anybody in the committee who is euphorically in favor of this assignment , " he said .
" we are all very reluctant and careful . " worrying many german deputies is the question of how a relatively small force of just 1,500 troops can ensure stability in a country the size of the entire european continent . johannes kaars , a social democrat parliamentarian , has also taken issue with the plan to station a majority of the soldiers in neighboring gabon or in a ship off its coast , saying this would make the undertaking ridiculous . " i will work to prevent a majority , " kaars said .
" arguments that the eu wants to stabilize the drc and that european credibility is at stake simply do n't go together with the deployment of just 1,500 troops , of which only about 700 will actually be based in kinshasa . " germa n comma n d i n potsdam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said germany is ready to lead at least 10 eu countries are expected to take part in the congo mission with germany and france making up the bulk of the force , contributing 500 troops each .
germany would command overall mission headquarters in potsdam , near berlin , with france taking charge on the ground in kinshasa . the mission has come about at the request of the united nations , which already has 17,000 peacekeepers in the drc .
during a fact-finding trip to kinshasa , social democrat mp and defense expert rolf kramer was convinced that eu and un together can make a difference , and is now appealing to his fellow mps to approve the mission . " i 'm now fully convinced that the eu presence makes sense because it will show the congolese population that the international community wants to help them , and it tells those seeking to make trouble that we are here to prevent that , " kramer said . germany 's strongest opposition party , the free-market liberal fdp , has already said it wo n't approve the deployment , while the green party has issues several conditions it wants to be met before it gives its approval . the greens want the mission to be limited to just four months , and are seeking government assurances that the eu force would remain strictly neutral even if conflicts were to erupt during the elections . the vote in the bundestag is scheduled for early april . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in khinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .
" you had to pick a country to concentrate on and do all the necessary research , " she said .
" you had to find out what it has in common with europe , what 's currently going on there , what are its traditions , how do people there look and what are the current fashions .
that 's when you started to get some ideas . "

and she also believes it 's important to show countries generally associated with poverty in a new , more positive light .
" we 're usually so busy reporting on hunger , suffering , death and disaster , " she said .
" so we decided we 'd like to report on something positive , about culture - and clothes , because everyone is interested in clothes .

a project organized by german agro action in cooperation with deutsche welle proves that fashion is an international language that can raise cultural awareness across the globe . it was a far cry from the sulky chic of the paris prêt-à-porter shows , but the third " world robes " fashion show at the deutsche welle building in bonn was all the more enjoyable for it . at first glance , many of the outfits paraded down the catwalk could n't have been more diverse .
but in fact , all the pieces modeled had one thing in common - they were made of fabric produced in mali , india and peru and based on traditional ethnic costumes . developme n t bo n us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes are a part of cultural heritage the event was showcasing the winning entries of the " world robes " initiative , a competition that gets fashion students exploring the cultures of other countries and learning about their fabrics , their clothes-making traditions and skills .
each year a fashion school from india , west africa or south america participates as an exclusive partner , with revenue from the project ploughed back into development projects in the partner countries . this year , the partner was the renowned national institute of fashion technology in new delhi .
the project was so successful it was recently honored by the initiative " germany - land of ideas . " the task at hand is to design a collection within a semester consisting of some 15 outfits and accessories made of fabric provided by german agro action .
the material comes from countries where the organization is actively involved in projects and manufactured in accordance with ecological and social standards .
this year , the textiles ranged from cotton with traditional printed motifs from mali to delicate paisley silk from southern india and thick hand-woven , woolen cloth in glowing colors of the rainbow from the peruvian andes .
cha n gi n g the world bildunterschrift : modern interpretations of traditional dress the challenge for the participants was to set these unusual textiles in a new , modern context - and the students were happy to rise to it .
among the winners was 31-year-old rafael gomes , a german-brazilian student at munich 's leading fashion school .
the dress he designed was a rococo-style frock with a corset made of pumpkin seeds , beans and coconut shells teamed with a tall wig made of bast fiber .
the look was marie antoinette meets ethnic chic , and a comment on the disposability of contemporary culture .
" i would jump at the chance to take part in more projects like this one , " gomes said .
" i 'd love to change the world with fashion.the contest was a way of showing that fashion can make a contribution , it can be socially aware and very effective . "
participant monika hordoan from hanover university was equally enthusiastic about the contest .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .
he needs a foreign troop presence in his country to defend against al qaeda and taliban remnants . religious freedom " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the daily bild .
the newspaper said rahman had converted to christianity while he lived in germany for nine years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul says she 's contact hamid karzai directly wieczorek-zeul said she would make a direct appeal to karzai . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed " deep concern " and said he would also intervene if necessary .
berlin 's embassy in kabul was " in close contact with the afghan side " on this , he told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . religious voices weighed in as well .
germany 's top catholic prelate , cardinal karl lehmann , described the case against rahman as " an alarming signal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the german bishops ' conference solemnly demands that christians in afghanistan be able to practice their faith openly and freely and that conversion to christianity must be possible without any disadvantages , " he said in a statement .

islamic sharia law stipulates death for apostasy . italy called in the afghan ambassador in rome and its former president francesco cossiga suggested withdrawing italian troops unless the man is spared . with some 2,700 german and 1,775 italian soldiers in afghanistan , the development presents a dilemma for president hamid karzai , a key ally in the us-led war on terrorism .
he needs a foreign troop presence in his country to defend against al qaeda and taliban remnants . religious freedom " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the daily bild .

berlin 's embassy in kabul was " in close contact with the afghan side " on this , he told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . religious voices weighed in as well .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said .

and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .

according to german authorities , such networks served to mislead authorities and facilitate the illegal exports .

" and we 've concluded that an estimated 100 dummy firms in germany are involved in it . " schmalzl added that the authorities could hardly keep up with the scale of illegal exports to iran . " when i say , 100 dummy firms , you can imagine that when we discover one and the federal prosecutor opens a case against them , we 're happy and pat ourselves on the back .
but 99 others are still in business , " schmalzl said . shopping for illegal arms the television program reported that most of the exports were designed to refine and perfect iran 's missile program , which is widely considered a key part of teheran 's ambitions to establish itself as a serious nuclear and military power .
many say it would pose a direct threat to israel . according to the station , for years iran has been sending agents on shopping trips to europe and to germany in order to improve the reach and precision of their missiles . most of the iranian spies disguised the arms exports through a maze of trade firms and distributions points both within iran and abroad .
according to german authorities , such networks served to mislead authorities and facilitate the illegal exports . " we 're talking about companies made up one to three persons who do n't necessarily produce anything themselves but rather order something from the producers and then conceal where the stuff is going , " karl-heinz matthias , president of the federal customs office , told ard . german exports not meant for iran alone even as the standoff between iran and the international community over teheran 's alleged covert nuclear program continues , experts point out that iran 's missile program has never been a secret . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the " father of the pakistani bomb " " a country , which like iran intensively works on missiles , only does this in order to be able to put nuclear weapons on the missiles , " oliver thränert of the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told the television station .
" iran is certainly far removed from that , but in the end , iran 's goal seems to be to fire nuclear weapons with its missiles . " however , german firms ' involvement in illegal arms exports is not confined to iran alone .
since the 1980s , german firms and middlemen , along with counterparts in other european countries , have been suspected of smuggling nuclear technology to regimes in pakistan and north korea . last friday , a court in mannheim began hearing the case of a german engineer accused of aiding libya 's nuclear program and being involved with the global nuclear mafia run by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology .
-lrb- march 17 , 2006 -rrb- why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players .

but viagra for horses ?
no , folks , it 's not a bit of spam that has appeared in e-mail boxes : it 's real-life sex help for a horse . a court in the small eastern german town of neuruppin ordered viagra to be given to a stallion after his new owner claimed the horse was impotent and refused to pay the full asking price for the animal .
the buyer of the horse called " vedor " paid just a tenth of the price of over 4,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,900 -rrb- , claiming the animal had only one testicle and had failed to get friendly with a female pony .
after examining the horse closely , a veterinarian discovered the testicle , said egbert simons , a spokesman for the neuruppin court .
and , lo and behold : once the stallion was given the potency drug viagra , he was up and raring to go .
it soon became evident that the horse was fully functional , the spokesman added .
the court then ordered the buyer of " vedor " to pay the full price . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for more quirky stories .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and italy defend afghan christian convert italy and germany , nato countries with troops in afghanistan , have expressed urgent concern to the kabul government about reports that an afghan convert to christianity faced the death penalty there .

after a 4-1 rout in italy , the german national team will be looking to fans in dortmund for a confidence boost during its friendly against the usa .
but just how much help they 'll be willing to provide remains in doubt . playing in signal iduna park , germany 's largest stadium , jürgen klinsmann 's team would normally be able to count on massive public support of some 70,000 fans , but the coach may be met with jeers of opposition for his decision to cut dortmund 's christian wörns from the national team . after being criticized for his decision to continue living in california while coaching the german team and even accused of damaging the german economy , a convincing win against the united states wednesday evening could help fans realize the former german world champion 's coaching commitment .

instead he said the game will help him make decisions on individual players before announcing his world cup line-up . " although we will be playing with a less than full roster , this game will provide an outstanding opportunity for some of our players to show they deserve strong consideration for the world cup , " arena said .

keller has been named us soccer 's athlete of the year three times , most recently in 2005 . dw-world.de : you are in a group with world-class goalkeepers from the czech republic and italy .
as a 36-year-old goalkeeper , what is your opinion of petr cech , 23 , and gianluigi buffon , 28 ? kasey keller : i feel i 'm playing as well as i 've ever played .
i think i 've been very fortunate throughout my career with injuries - i do n't think i 've ever been out longer than three weeks in my whole career .
it 's been a big benefit that i have n't had a knee problem or a shoulder problem .

a study by the emnid research institute reveals that germany 's 50-plus generation are happier with their lot than their european peers , but feel considerably more pessimistic about the future . " germans do tend to worry about the future , " said emnid ceo peter schöppner at the presentation of the report in berlin . their fellow fifty-somethings in britain , france , spain , italy and poland agree that life might well take a financial turn for the worse when they become pensioners , but germans expect a far bleaker future than anyone else . according to the survey which questioned 500 people in their fifties in six eu countries , what niggles them most are fears about care in their old age , illness and crime .
and most of them dread being financially worse off in twenty years time than they are today . even so , their fears are general rather than specific - and somewhat contradictory .
while somberly predicting that life will be much worse for the elderly in 20 years time than it is today , 63 percent of them say they 're upbeat about their own twilight years - compared to the 65 percent in france who look forward to growing old gracefully and the 74 percent of brits who think old age is when the fun really starts . fi n e for n ow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to stay fit even in their old age but the future appears to be what bothers germans most - because for the time being , most germans in their fifties are actually surprisingly pleased with themselves .
eighty-nine percent of them say they have all the friends they need , 74 percent are satisfied with their health-care , 76 percent feel financially secure and 64 percent describe themselves as open to new experiences . and despite their glum outlook on what lies in store , germans are the ones best-prepared for the ageing process . " germans plan for their future exceptionally well , " said schöppner , pointing out that they do more sports and eat more sensibly then many of their european counterparts . " people up to the age of 75 are as healthy today as the rest of the population , " he added . pessimistic - or just realistic ? unfortunately , they might have a point .
germany will indeed face serious social problems when the full effects of its ageing population start to kick in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is ageing fast " those born in the mid-60s grew up in a very youthful society , " said meinhard miegel , director of the institute for economics and society in bonn .
" but by the time they 're senior citizens in the 2040s , the percentage of 20-year-olds will have dropped by 50 percent and the percentage of 60-year-olds will have doubled . " so maybe germans have just done the math . " if over one third of a society is over 60 , the state wo n't be able to afford its welfare system , " miegel said . " a golden age is coming to an end , " he said , referring to germany 's post-war economic miracle .

figures for 2005 showed cd sales slipped for the seventh year in a row . the german music industry is still suffering from the weight of piracy with little hope of any growth in sales in the near future , according to the managing director of the german branch of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- and the german phonographic industry association -lrb- bpw -rrb- . peter zombik , the executive director of ifpi 's germany chapter , delivered a gloomy annual review of the industry at the annual press conference of the german recorded music associations in berlin .
not for the first time illegal downloaders and cd pirates were the main culprits . the industry in 2005 was again plagued by illegal private copying and downloading which hit cd sales and precipitated a seventh consecutive annual decrease in turnover , zombik said .
as illegal copying increased , cd sales fell steadily throughout the year , he added . as a result the hoped-for recovery in the industry did not materialize . " despite high expectations , 2005 turned out not to be the year in which the turnaround for the music industry took place , " zombik said . cd sales co n ti n e to fall as illegal copyi n g i n creases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lone shopper contemplates buying a cd total turnover for the german recording industry fell in 2005 for the seventh year in a row to 1,746 million euros -lrb- $ 2,113 million -rrb- , down from 1,753 million euros in 2004 .
this represents a decrease in sales of almost 45 percent in comparison with 1998 . this can be directly linked to statistics which show the increase in illegal copying over the last seven years .
the amount of music copied illegally has risen sharply from only 58 million cd equivalents in 1999 , with a corresponding steady decline in cd sales , which have fallen every year since 1999 when 198 million cds were sold . zombik told the press conference that in 2005 the equivalent of 439 million music cds were copied illegally in germany , in comparison to sales of 123.7 million cds , leading to the industry having to make " massive re-adjustments " including job losses .
over 30 percent of jobs in the sector have been lost in the last seven or eight years . according to industry figures , 21 million people copy music illegally in germany , from a total population of 82 million . unsurprisingly , industry executives called for more to be done to protect music and to combat illegal copying and measures suggested included restricting private copying to only making backups of cds that the consumer owns , a ban on software which can copy individual titles broadcast on internet radio stations , and better legal instruments to combat piracy , such as the right to obtain information on illegal downloads from internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- . legal dow n loads hit cd si n gles sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of legal portals also affect cd sales even the positives had a downside .
music tracks sold legally over registered portals increased in 2005 to 16.4 million individual tracks from 6.4 million tracks in 2004 .
but , as a result , the sales of cd singles were drastically reduced .
sales fell from 21.1 million units in 2004 to 15.4 million units in 2005 . while one could argue that while cd singles sales shrank , the titles themselves were still selling albeit in a different format , zombik pointed out that the online market is still very small in comparison to traditional channels , only making up around 2 percent of sales . even though the industry was still suffering from a slump in sales , there was some reason to be cheerful in the news that german artists had seen an increase in popularity last year .
cds from german artists now comprise 35.3 percent of total album sales , an increase from 30.3 percent in 2004 .
in terms of singles , german artists are now more popular than international stars and make up 51.4 per cent of singles sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

under sharia law , renouncing the religion of islam is a crime punishable by death , although islam respects the right of christians and jews to practice their faith . rahman told a judge at a preliminary hearing last week he became a christian while working for an aid group helping afghan refugees in pakistan 15 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul rahman faces the death sentence for converting to christianity " i 'm not an apostate .
i 'm obedient to god but i 'm a christian , that 's my choice , " rahman told the hearing . the case has sparked alarm in germany , the us and italy - all nato countries with peacekeeping troops in afghanistan .
german politicians weighed into the debate this week which has increasingly drawn the battle lines between religious conservatives in afghanistan and western diplomats pushing a reformist agenda . " we will do everything possible to save the life of abdul rahman , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the bild newspaper . christoph strässer , spokesman on human rights for the social democrats , part of germany 's governing coalition , said it was no surprise that the issue had inflamed passions in germany , a country which is deeply involved in afghanistan 's postwar reconstruction and peacekeeping and currently has 2,700 soldiers deployed there . " for one , germany is fundamentally against the death sentence , independent of whether it 's sanctioned by different cultures , " strässer said .
" and secondly , religious freedom is extremely precious to us and should be respected by an islamic society too . " " serious democracy deficits " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 2,700 peacekeepers in afghanistan several german conservative and liberal politicians , however , want the government to step up pressure on the afghan government by threatening to pull out german troops , freeze development aid and to review traditionally close ties between kabul and berlin . " the case is absolutely unbearable and is n't compatible with western values especially when western nations are so involved in securing the peace there and pumping in aid money , " said erika steinbach , spokeswoman on human rights for the ruling conservative christian democratic union . " it 's a particularly crass case of christian persecution and just the tip of the iceberg , " she added , pointing out that if afghanistan went ahead with the death sentence it would show that the country " has serious democracy deficits . " test for afghan democracy indeed , the abdul rahman case is being billed as a test for afghanistan 's path towards democracy , a stance staunchly advocated by pro-western president hamid karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , right , shows the new constitution to former king zahir shah starting in 2004 , afghanistan - with western help - ushered in a new reformed constitution , after which it elected a new parliament and created a supreme court and an independent legal system - steps considered essential in what the us administration calls " nation-building . " but , experts warn about the dangers of flaunting afghanistan as a poster-child for spreading democracy to former totalitarian countries .
more than four years after the fall of the taliban , the country remains riddled with corruption and cronyism linked to the country 's administrative system and $ 2.8 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- drug industry . " one should n't forget that karzai had to make several concessions to ultra-conservatives in drawing up the constitution , " said citha maass , afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . maass pointed out that the rahman case highlighted the contradictions in afghanistan 's constitution , which enshrines religious freedom on the one hand and upholds the supremacy of islamic sharia law on the other . " the problem is that sharia law has never been codified in afghan society and so every mullah interprets it the way he wants it .
and the absolute guardian is the supreme court which has several hardline members and a very conservative outlook , " maass added . the afghanistan expert also pointed out that recent protests over controversial cartoons published in european newspapers had been the most violent in afghanistan . " after 30 years of war , the afghans still have to learn democratic behavior .
it ca n't happen overnight , " she said . strengthening karzai most agree that pressure has to be stepped up on karzai 's government to stop rahman being sentenced to death , but not by threatening to pull out troops and halting aid . " that would be totally counterproductive and send a fatal signal to all those involved in rebuilding afghanistan , " said the spd 's strässer , who added it would inflict needless pain on the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai " at the end of the day , it 's the afghan president who has to sign and approve the death sentence and that 's where we should raise the pressure - by making him say clearly whose side he 's on , " said strässer . " it wo n't be easy with all the fundamentalists against him and he 'll need the west 's support and we 'll have to strengthen him , " he said .
" but that 's where the real test lies .

workers in welsh hospitals report an average of 22 daily incidents of verbal or physical abuse costing the nhs £ 6m every year .
and the auditor general for wales said under-reporting could be hiding the true extent of the problem .
a nursing union said the situation should not be allowed to continue . "
you do n't know when that is going to escalate from verbal abuse to actual physical abuse " naomi gibson , staff nurse one nurse has spoken of delayed shock and distress after being punched repeatedly .
naomi gibson , a staff nurse at the accident and emergency department in prince charles hospital , merthyr tydfil , said staff are often confronted with verbal assault on a daily basis .
she said she later needed to take time off work after being attacked as she tended to a patient .
she said : " i was working an afternoon shift , an ambulance crew brought a patient in , i was treating her and going to do her blood pressure , she started hitting out .
" i advised the nurse with me to go out and phone police and security .
i walked out behind her , -lsb- the -rsb- patient jumped up off the trolley and grabbed hold of my uniform , punched me twice in the head .
" i managed to push her down on the trolley and she again punched me another twice on the head .
" i had redness to the side of my head and my face where i had been punched , -lsb- i was -rsb- mostly shaken up , frightened . "
' distress ' ms gibson said the shock of what happened to her did not sink in until later .
" when you first get attacked it 's like you are running on adrenalin - you are shaking but you carry on , " she said .
" it was n't until a week later really it hit home and i had to go on the sick because i was really physically shaking and distressed . "
she added : " mostly on a daily occurrence we have verbal assaults in a & e which are quite threatening and again that brings back all the frightening experience i had on that day when i was physically assaulted - you do n't know when that is going to escalate from verbal abuse to actual physical abuse .
" you feel like you are fighting a losing battle and it seems the more we try the worse we are treated , " she added .
the welsh assembly audit committee report , protecting nhs staff from violence and aggression , said trusts are complying with legal obligations and guidelines on protecting staff .
but it added that there are still gaps in information collected about the nature and causes of incidents . "
the welsh assembly government has shown some leadership in tackling the problem but more , much more , needs to be done " tina donnelly , royal college of nursing improvements on data collection and risk assessments of some patients - who are delayed in being transferred - are called for in the report .
last september the auditor general for wales , jeremy colman , said the problem could be much worse because of under-reporting .
the royal college of nursing director tina donnelly said steps had been taken but more needs to be done .
ms donnelly said : " it is a state of affairs that can not be allowed to continue .
" to date the welsh assembly government has shown some leadership in tackling the problem but more , much more , needs to be done . "
in 2003-04 , nhs trusts in wales spent £ 6.3m dealing with violent incidents as well as on prevention through training and security .

workers in welsh hospitals report an average of 22 daily incidents of verbal or physical abuse costing the nhs £ 6m every year .
and the auditor general for wales said under-reporting could be hiding the true extent of the problem .
a nursing union said the situation should not be allowed to continue .
you do n't know when that is going to escalate from verbal abuse to actual physical abuse naomi gibson , staff nurse one nurse has spoken of delayed shock and distress after being punched repeatedly .
naomi gibson , a staff nurse at the accident and emergency department in prince charles hospital , merthyr tydfil , said staff are often confronted with verbal assault on a daily basis .
she said she later needed to take time off work after being attacked as she tended to a patient .
she said : " i was working an afternoon shift , an ambulance crew brought a patient in , i was treating her and going to do her blood pressure , she started hitting out .
" i advised the nurse with me to go out and phone police and security .
i walked out behind her , -lsb- the -rsb- patient jumped up off the trolley and grabbed hold of my uniform , punched me twice in the head .
" i managed to push her down on the trolley and she again punched me another twice on the head .
" i had redness to the side of my head and my face where i had been punched , -lsb- i was -rsb- mostly shaken up , frightened . "
' distress ' ms gibson said the shock of what happened to her did not sink in until later .
" when you first get attacked it 's like you are running on adrenalin - you are shaking but you carry on , " she said .
" it was n't until a week later really it hit home and i had to go on the sick because i was really physically shaking and distressed . "
she added : " mostly on a daily occurrence we have verbal assaults in a & e which are quite threatening and again that brings back all the frightening experience i had on that day when i was physically assaulted - you do n't know when that is going to escalate from verbal abuse to actual physical abuse .
" you feel like you are fighting a losing battle and it seems the more we try the worse we are treated , " she added .
the welsh assembly audit committee report , protecting nhs staff from violence and aggression , said trusts are complying with legal obligations and guidelines on protecting staff .
but it added that there are still gaps in information collected about the nature and causes of incidents .
the welsh assembly government has shown some leadership in tackling the problem but more , much more , needs to be done tina donnelly , royal college of nursing improvements on data collection and risk assessments of some patients - who are delayed in being transferred - are called for in the report .
last september the auditor general for wales , jeremy colman , said the problem could be much worse because of under-reporting .
the royal college of nursing director tina donnelly said steps had been taken but more needs to be done .
ms donnelly said : " it is a state of affairs that can not be allowed to continue .
" to date the welsh assembly government has shown some leadership in tackling the problem but more , much more , needs to be done . "

if the project goes ahead it would be the biggest trade deal between russia and china and would cast doubt on an alternative plan to pump oil to japan .
energy-hungry china and japan have been competing for years for a direct link to russian oil supplies , but moscow has so far refused to commit to a route .
on tuesday , china and russia signed a separate deal to double gas to china .
the deal on the gas pipeline could see china receive up to 80bn cubic metres of russian gas annually within five years .
mr putin is currently visiting china with a 90-member delegation , including business leaders and representatives of russia 's oil and gas industries .
japanese offer president putin 's hint that russia now favours a chinese route for the oil pipeline will come as a surprise , says the bbc 's quentin somerville in shanghai .
the japanese had offered to pay most of the construction costs and the contract had previously appeared to be going their way , our correspondent says .
russia stressed on tuesday that a feasibility study must be completed before a final decision is made on the route of the oil pipeline .
if a deal goes ahead with beijing , the pipeline will bring 600,000 barrels of oil daily from eastern siberia to north-eastern china .
moscow 's energy minister told russian news agency , tass , that the link to china could be constructed before the end of 2008 .
russia 's oil supplies , though plentiful , are not inexhaustible and building a japanese and a chinese pipeline is not a likely option , our correspondent says .

as part of the series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , health minister andy kerr looks forward to a new era for the people of scotland .
the minister believes that the legislation will become one of the greatest achievements of devolution .
from 0600 gmt in the morning on 26 march , 2006 scotland will become the first part of the uk to be smoke-free .
the executive hopes the ban will see people kicking the habit this far-reaching and bold step will protect the health of hundreds of thousands of scots who find themselves exposed to second-hand smoke every year .
in scotland , second-hand smoke is associated with up to 1,000 deaths a year among lifelong non-smokers - the case for reducing exposure to second-hand smoke to improve health is now indisputable .
it will also help many people to give up smoking and encourage a no-smoking culture for future generations .
with over 13,000 deaths a year from smoking-related illnesses in scotland , the potential benefits to the health of the people of scotland are enormous .
the comprehensive nature of the legislation will also help us to close the health inequalities in our society , with smoking a major contributor to disease and reduced life expectancy in our least well off communities .
we know already that seven out of 10 people do n't smoke and of those who do , seven out of 10 want to give up in ireland there has also been a significant drop in the number of cigarettes being smoked , particularly among heavy smokers since 2003 .
and in new york there are now nearly 200,000 fewer smokers since 2002 .
over the same period , exposure to second-hand smoke in homes in new york dropped by more than a third .
in scotland , we know already that seven out of 10 people do n't smoke and of those who do , seven out of 10 want to give up .
the smoking ban will make it easier for those who do decide to give up to do so .
right decision calls to the national quitline in 2005 , at over 60,000 , were almost double the number calling in 2003 .
so scots are starting to make the effort to give up now .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking and as a former smoker i appreciate fully the challenge it presents , but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
that is why we are investing record levels of funding - £ 11m by 2007/8 - in services to support people who want to give up .
scotland has a high rate of smoking-related disease improved services in communities across scotland - combined with the introduction of the ban - make 2006 the best year yet to give up .
you can now get cessation support in a range of settings from the local bingo hall to the shopping centre .
this makes it much easier for people to get the encouragement and support they need to quit .
it really is the right decision , not just for the smoker , but for their friends and their families .
it will help keep families together for longer .
international evidence also suggests that the ban will be good for the economy and without significant impact on the hospitality sector .
in ireland bar retail value sales are now up on pre-ban levels .
premature deaths so 26 march , 2006 really is a big day for scotland .
the benefits that will follow are priceless .
our country 's health and productivity will improve and the incidence of smoking-related diseases will fall .
it will give our wider drive to improve the health of scots an extremely solid foundation on which we can build .
scotland 's health is improving , but not fast enough .
premature deaths from cancer , stroke and heart disease have all significantly decreased in recent years however people living in deprived areas have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those in more affluent areas .
the smoking ban will have a massive impact on this .
i am confident that , in time , the improvement in public health delivered through this legislation will be regarded as one of the great achievements of devolution .
passive smoking is not just a nuisance - it is a killer .
and that is why this legislation is so important for the people of scotland and the future health of our nation .
we should all be proud .

as part of the series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , health minister andy kerr looks forward to a new era for the people of scotland .
the minister believes that the legislation will become one of the greatest achievements of devolution .
from 0600 gmt in the morning on 26 march , 2006 scotland will become the first part of the uk to be smoke-free .
the executive hopes the ban will see people kicking the habit this far-reaching and bold step will protect the health of hundreds of thousands of scots who find themselves exposed to second-hand smoke every year .
in scotland , second-hand smoke is associated with up to 1,000 deaths a year among lifelong non-smokers - the case for reducing exposure to second-hand smoke to improve health is now indisputable .
it will also help many people to give up smoking and encourage a no-smoking culture for future generations .
with over 13,000 deaths a year from smoking-related illnesses in scotland , the potential benefits to the health of the people of scotland are enormous .
the comprehensive nature of the legislation will also help us to close the health inequalities in our society , with smoking a major contributor to disease and reduced life expectancy in our least well off communities .
we know already that seven out of 10 people do n't smoke and of those who do , seven out of 10 want to give up in ireland there has also been a significant drop in the number of cigarettes being smoked , particularly among heavy smokers since 2003 .
and in new york there are now nearly 200,000 fewer smokers since 2002 .
over the same period , exposure to second-hand smoke in homes in new york dropped by more than a third .
in scotland , we know already that seven out of 10 people do n't smoke and of those who do , seven out of 10 want to give up .
the smoking ban will make it easier for those who do decide to give up to do so .
right decision calls to the national quitline in 2005 , at over 60,000 , were almost double the number calling in 2003 .
so scots are starting to make the effort to give up now .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking and as a former smoker i appreciate fully the challenge it presents , but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
that is why we are investing record levels of funding - £ 11m by 2007/8 - in services to support people who want to give up .
scotland has a high rate of smoking-related disease improved services in communities across scotland - combined with the introduction of the ban - make 2006 the best year yet to give up .
you can now get cessation support in a range of settings from the local bingo hall to the shopping centre .
this makes it much easier for people to get the encouragement and support they need to quit .
it really is the right decision , not just for the smoker , but for their friends and their families .
it will help keep families together for longer .
international evidence also suggests that the ban will be good for the economy and without significant impact on the hospitality sector .
in ireland bar retail value sales are now up on pre-ban levels .

over the same period , exposure to second-hand smoke in homes in new york dropped by more than a third .
in scotland , we know already that seven out of 10 people do n't smoke and of those who do , seven out of 10 want to give up .
the smoking ban will make it easier for those who do decide to give up to do so .
right decision calls to the national quitline in 2005 , at over 60,000 , were almost double the number calling in 2003 .
so scots are starting to make the effort to give up now .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking and as a former smoker i appreciate fully the challenge it presents , but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
that is why we are investing record levels of funding - £ 11m by 2007/8 - in services to support people who want to give up .
scotland has a high rate of smoking-related disease improved services in communities across scotland - combined with the introduction of the ban - make 2006 the best year yet to give up .
you can now get cessation support in a range of settings from the local bingo hall to the shopping centre .
this makes it much easier for people to get the encouragement and support they need to quit .
it really is the right decision , not just for the smoker , but for their friends and their families .
it will help keep families together for longer .
international evidence also suggests that the ban will be good for the economy and without significant impact on the hospitality sector .

the benefits that will follow are priceless .
our country 's health and productivity will improve and the incidence of smoking-related diseases will fall .

scotland 's health is improving , but not fast enough .
premature deaths from cancer , stroke and heart disease have all significantly decreased in recent years however people living in deprived areas have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those in more affluent areas .
the smoking ban will have a massive impact on this .

as part of the series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , health minister andy kerr looks forward to a new era for the people of scotland .
the minister believes that the legislation will become one of the greatest achievements of devolution . "
from 0600 gmt in the morning on 26 march , 2006 scotland will become the first part of the uk to be smoke-free .
this far-reaching and bold step will protect the health of hundreds of thousands of scots who find themselves exposed to second-hand smoke every year .
in scotland , second-hand smoke is associated with up to 1,000 deaths a year among lifelong non-smokers - the case for reducing exposure to second-hand smoke to improve health is now indisputable .
it will also help many people to give up smoking and encourage a no-smoking culture for future generations .
with over 13,000 deaths a year from smoking-related illnesses in scotland , the potential benefits to the health of the people of scotland are enormous .
the comprehensive nature of the legislation will also help us to close the health inequalities in our society , with smoking a major contributor to disease and reduced life expectancy in our least well off communities . "

as part of the series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , paul waterson , chief executive of the scottish licensed trade association -lrb- slta -rrb- , warns that businesses will close .
mr waterson is angered by how the ban has been brought in and what it will mean for members who will face having to police it . "
the scottish licensed trade association has vigorously opposed the imminent smoking ban from the start .
we believe that customers should have a choice of places in which to smoke -providing that their habit does not disturb others - and that simple but effective ventilation or smoking rooms would very adequately protect staff from any dangers posed by the smoke .
we also believe , that the ban has been brought in with unnecessary haste .
this will damage our industry far more than if it had been brought in with proper consultation over a reasonable time frame .
time would have permitted us to educate and prepare our customers and businesses properly and for the government to encourage more people to quit .
this undue haste has also caused confusion on compliance and enforcement from local authorities . "
without doubt there will be pub closures and job losses " unfortunately , our concerns have been ignored .
pub owners are now responsible for reducing the amount that people smoke , even though the evidence from ireland and norway shows that bans actually have no effect on the number of people who smoke - only where they smoke .
to understand how best to adapt to a ban we have looked closely at the pub industry in ireland .
it is clear that operators who adapted first did best and this meant creating comfortable outdoor areas .
their regulations were pretty clear - shelters with a roof may have a maximum of half the wall space enclosed .
legal product consequently the licensed trade has been willing and able to invest large sums of money to keep their smoking customers happy .
the story here is different .
in practical terms licensees in scotland have been given less than a month to organise shelters outside for their core customer base - the smokers .
this may seem simple , but when you consider that planning permission takes eight weeks and licensing changes can take months , before even considering the cost of and physically installing canopies and heaters etc . , four weeks becomes a tight if not impossible schedule .
add to this the fact that every local authority we have spoken to has a different idea about what is and is n't allowed as a smoking shelter - including ' if it has a roof of any description , you ca n't smoke under it ' - and you 'll quickly understand that following the letter of the law is not as straightforward as it first appears .
a lot has been written and said about the irish experience .
health groups think that it has been an unqualified success .
many people in our industry know that this success has come at a price - and that we as an industry will be forced to pay that price here too .
without doubt there will be pub closures and job losses - this is the price to our industry , but more widely the law allows local authorities to ban smoking in other places like local parks and several are considering doing just this .
we are not obsessed by personal freedoms , particularly those that are unpleasant for some people , such as smoking .
but we are concerned that limits on how people use what is in fact a legal product have been crossed and could open the floodgates for controls on other legal pastimes - drinking , eating , freedom of speech . "

as part of the series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , paul waterson , chief executive of the scottish licensed trade association -lrb- slta -rrb- , warns that businesses will close .
mr waterson is angered by how the ban has been brought in and what it will mean for members who will face having to police it .
the scottish licensed trade association has vigorously opposed the imminent smoking ban from the start .
this week is the last chance to smoke in a bar we believe that customers should have a choice of places in which to smoke -providing that their habit does not disturb others - and that simple but effective ventilation or smoking rooms would very adequately protect staff from any dangers posed by the smoke .
we also believe , that the ban has been brought in with unnecessary haste .
this will damage our industry far more than if it had been brought in with proper consultation over a reasonable time frame .
time would have permitted us to educate and prepare our customers and businesses properly and for the government to encourage more people to quit .
this undue haste has also caused confusion on compliance and enforcement from local authorities .
without doubt there will be pub closures and job losses unfortunately , our concerns have been ignored .
pub owners are now responsible for reducing the amount that people smoke , even though the evidence from ireland and norway shows that bans actually have no effect on the number of people who smoke - only where they smoke .
to understand how best to adapt to a ban we have looked closely at the pub industry in ireland .
it is clear that operators who adapted first did best and this meant creating comfortable outdoor areas .
their regulations were pretty clear - shelters with a roof may have a maximum of half the wall space enclosed .
legal product consequently the licensed trade has been willing and able to invest large sums of money to keep their smoking customers happy .
the story here is different .
in practical terms licensees in scotland have been given less than a month to organise shelters outside for their core customer base - the smokers .
this may seem simple , but when you consider that planning permission takes eight weeks and licensing changes can take months , before even considering the cost of and physically installing canopies and heaters etc . , four weeks becomes a tight if not impossible schedule .
mr waterson objects to controls over legal pastimes add to this the fact that every local authority we have spoken to has a different idea about what is and is n't allowed as a smoking shelter - including ' if it has a roof of any description , you ca n't smoke under it ' - and you 'll quickly understand that following the letter of the law is not as straightforward as it first appears .
a lot has been written and said about the irish experience .
health groups think that it has been an unqualified success .
many people in our industry know that this success has come at a price - and that we as an industry will be forced to pay that price here too .
without doubt there will be pub closures and job losses - this is the price to our industry , but more widely the law allows local authorities to ban smoking in other places like local parks and several are considering doing just this .
we are not obsessed by personal freedoms , particularly those that are unpleasant for some people , such as smoking .
but we are concerned that limits on how people use what is in fact a legal product have been crossed and could open the floodgates for controls on other legal pastimes - drinking , eating , freedom of speech .

national executive committee chairman sir jeremy beecham defended party treasurer jack dromey , who has said he knew nothing about £ 14m in loans .
mr clarke said this raised queries about mr dromey 's capacity for the job .
sir jeremy said the treasurer " should n't be criticised " and had " acted perfectly properly " .
meanwhile , police are examining three complaints that labour has breached the honours system , something it denies .
on tuesday mr clarke said the fact mr dromey had not known about the loans , given to the party last year , meant " you have to wonder how well he was doing his work " .

sir jeremy responded with a statement saying it was " absolutely clear that the reasons that nec officers , including the elected party treasurer , did not know about the loans had nothing to do with any failings on their part " .
he added : " jack dromey has always carried out his responsibilities with great diligence and retained the absolute confidence of the nec in ensuring that this issue is dealt with . "
he later told the bbc that mr clarke had not read the situation correctly .
he said : " i do n't know how closely charles has been involved in all this .

on tuesday scotland yard announced it had received three complaints that the party had breached the honours system , including one from scottish national mp angus mcneil and one from elfyn llwyd , parliamentary leader of plaid cymru .
the police investigation will focus on whether the honours -lrb- prevention of abuses -rrb- act 1925 was abided by and whether honours were given by labour in return for loans or donations .
sir jeremy said labour would co-operate with the police inquiry but dismissed the complaints as " opportunism " .
the controversy surrounding the loans began with the revelation that a number of millionaires who loaned labour large sums around the time of last year 's general election were subsequently nominated by tony blair for seats in the house of lords .
the nominations were blocked after the independent commission which vets applications raised concerns over three names .
mr blair has denied nominating them in return for their loans .
mr dromey later revealed he and other elected party officials had been kept in the dark about loans arranged by mr blair 's chief fundraiser , lord levy .
according to the daily telegraph , four of the 12 donors who lent the money in the run-up to the general election have indicated they expect the money to be repaid between august this year and april 2008 .
they each said they had made the loans at commercial rates of interest .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- salt reduction targets ' too soft ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes wednesday , 22 march 2006 , 09:00 gmt salt reduction targets ' too soft ' campaigners say revised targets set by a government watchdog for cutting salt in food do not go far enough .
the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- has published targets to cut salt in 85 types of food product by 2010 .
however , campaigners say the proposals have been watered down following pressure from the food industry .
they argue that failure to reduce salt in the diet by sufficient levels could endanger the lives of thousands of people a year in the uk . "
the power of the food industry is once again in evidence and the purely commercial interests of food companies have been allowed to prevail " professor graham macgregor q & a : salt do you know your salt ?
it is estimated that at least 26 million people in the uk eat more than the recommended 6g of salt per day .
the average daily consumption is closer to 10g .
eating too much salt is a significant risk factor in developing high blood pressure , which can triple the risk of heart disease and stroke .
experts estimate that if average consumption was cut to 6g a day , it would prevent 70,000 heart attacks and strokes a year .
processed foods are thought to account for about 75 % of the average person 's salt intake .
the new fsa targets , which are not compulsory , include : crisps should have no more than 1.5g of salt per 100g - a reduction of about 10 % on current levels bacon : 3.5g of salt per 100g standard salted butter : 1.7g of salt per 100g breakfast cereals : 0.8g per 100g baked beans : 0.8g per 100g pre-packed bread and rolls : 1.1g per 100g the guidelines follow a consultation on an original set of planned targets which was launched in august last year .
' tragedy for uk ' salt campaign group cash -lrb- consensus action on salt and health -rrb- accused the fsa of bowing to industry pressure by increasing its target salt levels in some food categories .
professor graham macgregor , its chairman , said some snacks aimed at children would remain saltier than sea water even if the fsa targets were met .
he said : " the power of the food industry is once again in evidence , and the purely commercial interests of food companies have been allowed to prevail .
" there are no taste , technical or safety reasons why salt can not be reduced far further than these new targets . "
professor macgregor said the new guidelines were likely to lead to an average daily salt intake of 8g , not the 6g desired .
" as a result , 30,000 more strokes and heart attacks will occur unnecessarily , 15,000 of which will be fatal .
that is a tragedy for the uk . "
paul lincoln , of the national heart forum , said the food industry had not done enough to cut salt levels .
he said : " the problem is that these targets are voluntary .
some companies have demonstrated that it is possible to make significant and rapid reductions .
" however , without the threat of any sanctions or penalties , some sectors are clearly unwilling to press ahead with healthy reformulations . "
' challenging ' targets the food and drink federation , which represents uk manufacturers , said the fsa 's targets appeared " more realistic " than the 2005 proposals - but were still challenging .
deputy director general martin paterson said salt levels had already been substantially lowered in many products .
" at first glance , the targets appear more realistic than the 2005 proposals , but we will need to study the detail to ensure the targets are practical , realistic and take into account the microbiological safety of food . "
public health minister caroline flint said : " our salt reduction targets are challenging , but many food manufacturers and retailers have responded to this challenge .
" high levels of salt in our diets can contribute to major diseases and illnesses like high blood pressure , heart disease and stroke .
" government and industry action is making a difference , because people are more aware than ever of the need to reduce the amount of salt they eat . "

the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- has published targets to cut salt in 85 types of food product by 2010 .
however , campaigners say the proposals have been watered down following pressure from the food industry .
they argue that failure to reduce salt in the diet by sufficient levels could endanger the lives of thousands of people a year in the uk .
the power of the food industry is once again in evidence and the purely commercial interests of food companies have been allowed to prevail professor graham macgregor q & a : salt do you know your salt ?
it is estimated that at least 26 million people in the uk eat more than the recommended 6g of salt per day .
the average daily consumption is closer to 10g .
eating too much salt is a significant risk factor in developing high blood pressure , which can triple the risk of heart disease and stroke .
experts estimate that if average consumption was cut to 6g a day , it would prevent 70,000 heart attacks and strokes a year .
processed foods are thought to account for about 75 % of the average person 's salt intake .
the new fsa targets , which are not compulsory , include : crisps should have no more than 1.5g of salt per 100g - a reduction of about 10 % on current levels bacon : 3.5g of salt per 100g standard salted butter : 1.7g of salt per 100g breakfast cereals : 0.8g per 100g baked beans : 0.8g per 100g pre-packed bread and rolls : 1.1g per 100g the guidelines follow a consultation on an original set of planned targets which was launched in august last year .
' tragedy for uk ' salt campaign group cash -lrb- consensus action on salt and health -rrb- accused the fsa of bowing to industry pressure by increasing its target salt levels in some food categories .
professor graham macgregor , its chairman , said some snacks aimed at children would remain saltier than sea water even if the fsa targets were met .
he said : " the power of the food industry is once again in evidence , and the purely commercial interests of food companies have been allowed to prevail .
" there are no taste , technical or safety reasons why salt can not be reduced far further than these new targets . "
professor macgregor said the new guidelines were likely to lead to an average daily salt intake of 8g , not the 6g desired .
" as a result , 30,000 more strokes and heart attacks will occur unnecessarily , 15,000 of which will be fatal .
that is a tragedy for the uk . "
paul lincoln , of the national heart forum , said the food industry had not done enough to cut salt levels .
he said : " the problem is that these targets are voluntary .
some companies have demonstrated that it is possible to make significant and rapid reductions .
" however , without the threat of any sanctions or penalties , some sectors are clearly unwilling to press ahead with healthy reformulations . "
' challenging ' targets the food and drink federation , which represents uk manufacturers , said the fsa 's targets appeared " more realistic " than the 2005 proposals - but were still challenging .
deputy director general martin paterson said salt levels had already been substantially lowered in many products .
" at first glance , the targets appear more realistic than the 2005 proposals , but we will need to study the detail to ensure the targets are practical , realistic and take into account the microbiological safety of food . "
public health minister caroline flint said : " our salt reduction targets are challenging , but many food manufacturers and retailers have responded to this challenge .
" high levels of salt in our diets can contribute to major diseases and illnesses like high blood pressure , heart disease and stroke .
" government and industry action is making a difference , because people are more aware than ever of the need to reduce the amount of salt they eat . "

too much salt is linked to high blood pressure , which is turn can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
the government watchdog the food standards agency announced targets for reducing salt in a range of food products in 2006 .
why do we need salt ?
salt is a commonly occuring mineral , the technical name of which is sodium chloride .
it is the sodium part of salt that is important .
the body needs a certain amount of sodium to function properly .
sodium helps to maintain the concentration of body fluids at correct levels .
it also plays a central role in the transmission of electrical impulses in the nerves , and helps cells to take up nutrients .
why is too much salt bad ?
in adults , when levels of sodium are too high , the body retains too much water and the volume of bodily fluids increases .
many scientists , although not all , believe this process is linked to high blood pressure , or hypertension , which in turn is linked to a greater risk of coronary heart disease and stroke .
with high levels of fluid circulating through the brain there is a greater chance that weaknesses in the brain 's blood vessels are exposed , and that they may burst , causing a stroke .
similarly , a greater volume of fluid passing through the heart can place additional strain on the organ , increasing the possibility of coronary disease .
however , there are many potential causes of hypertension and coronary heart disease , and some scientists deny that salt plays any significant role at all .
an adult will be able to remove salt from the body through the kidneys into the urine .
however , very young babies do not have the capacity to process large quantities of salt as the kidneys are not yet developed .
if they are given adult food with a higher salt content before they are at least four months old , excess sodium can accumulate in the body , causing kidney , liver and brain damage , and in very occasional cases , death .
it is recommended that babies are given only milk , whether breast or formula , for the first four months of life .
baby foods are supposed to contain lower levels of salt , and it is recommended that if adult foods are to be given , unprocessed foods should be used , and no salt added .
how much salt should we eat ?
the government recommends that adults should eat 6g of salt a day .
however , the average intake of salt is between 9g and 10g a day .
experts estimate that if average consumption was cut to 6g a day it would prevent 70,000 heart attacks and strokes a year .
the main sources of salt in the diet are processed foods and salt added during cooking or at the table .
meat and meat products , and bread can also be high in salt .
processed foods are thought to account for around 75 % of the average person 's salt intake .
however , research published in the lancet medical journal suggested that most people could not tell the difference between loaves with markedly different salt content .
salt is added to processed foods to aid preservation and to improve taste .
sodium is present in additives such as monosodium glutamate and sodium bicarbonate .
small amounts of sodium can be found naturally in some foods such as eggs and fish .
the salt we sprinkle on our food from cellar accounts for only 10 % -15 % of our intake .
what action has the food standards agency taken ?
it drew up targets for the food industry to cut the salt content of a range of 85 products .
the aim was that if the targets were enforced , the average daily intake of salt would fall to the recommended level of 6g .
however , the targets were voluntary , and campaigners said they were not set at a sufficiently tough level .
they argued that even if followed by the food industry they would result in an average daily intake of 8g , rather than 6g .
professor graham macgregor , of cash -lrb- consensus action on salt and health -rrb- , said that would mean an extra 30,000 more strokes and heart attacks a year in the uk - 15,000 of which would be fatal .
what should we do ?
dr wynnie chan , a nutrition scientist for the british nurtrition foundation , says that everybody should look to reduce the amount of salt in their diet .
" it would have a significant effect on those people who need to reduce their salt levels because they are susceptible to hypertension , but it would also do no harm for the whole population to reduce its salt intake , " she said .
dr chan said there were four main ways to reduce salt intake : stop adding table salt to food once it is served choose items with a reduced sodium content carefully monitor the salt content of processed food eat more fruit and vegetables - they contain potassium which balances the effect of salt on the body reading food labels can be confusing as they often give the sodium , rather than the salt content of food .
to calculate the amount of salt in a product , multiply the sodium content by two-and-a-half times .
