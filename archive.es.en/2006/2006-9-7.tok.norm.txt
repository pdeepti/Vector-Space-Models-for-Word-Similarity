11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .
zapatero has offered them a landing runway .
if they choose not to use it , the end could be disastrous . " andreu jerez -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain convicts sept .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .

" this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .

the match was one of 21 european championship qualifying matches matches that took place on wednesday . not unusually , it took a while for the clear favorite to crack the defensive wall .
even after lukas podolski beat his defender and headed the ball into the net in the 11th minute , san marino stood firm for another quarter of an hour . löw acknowledged san marino 's stiff resistance in that first half-hour , but was satisfied by his players ' reaction . " we had fu n " " we came into the match with a good attitude , a professional attitude even against such an opponent , " löw said .
" all in all , i think we saw lots of great goals and that we had fun . " after 30 minutes of play , the flood gates burst .
the pressure , and the condition of the professionals from germany , proved too great for san marino .
by the end of the first half , the score stood 6-0 on two goals by podolski , two from miroslav klose , one from michael ballack and another from bastian schweinsteiger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany forward lukas podolski celebrated after scoring one of his two goals .

podolski matched his first-half performance with another two goals , bringing his total to 20 in just 35 games in a german national uniform . thomas hitzlsperger , currently on the bench in stuttgart , scored his first two goals for the national squad .
defender manuel friedrich also got his premiere goal in just his third game on the german team .
goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose yellow jersey remained unstained during the match , almost had a chance to score on a penalty kick just one minute from time . fair play ? " running up to take the kick , i was n't so sure because it seemed like humiliation , " the arsenal keeper said .
" i got up to the penalty spot and then the san marino players started saying ' fair play , fair play ! ' and so i thought it better to forget it and not humiliate the opponent . " bernd schneider , who again played a very good match , then converted the penalty kick .
captain ballack , who played just 45 minutes , said he was pleased with the result , and believes that the team is going down the right path . " when we come up against difficult opponents , we 'll have to adjust more to that team 's abilities , " he said .
" nevertheless , we want to play our style of soccer and we 've done that the last few weeks .

the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .

at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ?

the match was one of 21 european championship qualifying matches matches that took place on wednesday . not unusually , it took a while for the clear favorite to crack the defensive wall .
even after lukas podolski beat his defender and headed the ball into the net in the 11th minute , san marino stood firm for another quarter of an hour . löw acknowledged san marino 's stiff resistance in that first half-hour , but was satisfied by his players ' reaction . " we had fu n " " we came into the match with a good attitude , a professional attitude even against such an opponent , " löw said .
" all in all , i think we saw lots of great goals and that we had fun . " after 30 minutes of play , the flood gates burst .
the pressure , and the condition of the professionals from germany , proved too great for san marino .
by the end of the first half , the score stood 6-0 on two goals by podolski , two from miroslav klose , one from michael ballack and another from bastian schweinsteiger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany forward lukas podolski celebrated after scoring one of his two goals .
the german juggernaut continued directly after half-time on an indirect kick by schweinsteiger .
podolski matched his first-half performance with another two goals , bringing his total to 20 in just 35 games in a german national uniform . thomas hitzlsperger , currently on the bench in stuttgart , scored his first two goals for the national squad .
defender manuel friedrich also got his premiere goal in just his third game on the german team .
goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose yellow jersey remained unstained during the match , almost had a chance to score on a penalty kick just one minute from time . fair play ? " running up to take the kick , i was n't so sure because it seemed like humiliation , " the arsenal keeper said .
" i got up to the penalty spot and then the san marino players started saying ' fair play , fair play ! ' and so i thought it better to forget it and not humiliate the opponent . " bernd schneider , who again played a very good match , then converted the penalty kick .
captain ballack , who played just 45 minutes , said he was pleased with the result , and believes that the team is going down the right path . " when we come up against difficult opponents , we 'll have to adjust more to that team 's abilities , " he said .
" nevertheless , we want to play our style of soccer and we 've done that the last few weeks .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .

" if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said .

" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

the match was one of 21 european championship qualifying matches matches that took place on wednesday . not unusually , it took a while for the clear favorite to crack the defensive wall .

" we had fu n " " we came into the match with a good attitude , a professional attitude even against such an opponent , " löw said .
" all in all , i think we saw lots of great goals and that we had fun . " after 30 minutes of play , the flood gates burst .

defender manuel friedrich also got his premiere goal in just his third game on the german team .
goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose yellow jersey remained unstained during the match , almost had a chance to score on a penalty kick just one minute from time . fair play ? " running up to take the kick , i was n't so sure because it seemed like humiliation , " the arsenal keeper said .
" i got up to the penalty spot and then the san marino players started saying ' fair play , fair play ! ' and so i thought it better to forget it and not humiliate the opponent . " bernd schneider , who again played a very good match , then converted the penalty kick .
captain ballack , who played just 45 minutes , said he was pleased with the result , and believes that the team is going down the right path . " when we come up against difficult opponents , we 'll have to adjust more to that team 's abilities , " he said .
" nevertheless , we want to play our style of soccer and we 've done that the last few weeks .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2006 chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern , german army : learning to use tanks that detect nuclear , biological and chemical agents in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2006 chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern , german army : learning to use tanks that detect nuclear , biological and chemical agents in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

the match was one of 21 european championship qualifying matches matches that took place on wednesday . not unusually , it took a while for the clear favorite to crack the defensive wall .
even after lukas podolski beat his defender and headed the ball into the net in the 11th minute , san marino stood firm for another quarter of an hour . löw acknowledged san marino 's stiff resistance in that first half-hour , but was satisfied by his players ' reaction . " we had fu n " " we came into the match with a good attitude , a professional attitude even against such an opponent , " löw said .
" all in all , i think we saw lots of great goals and that we had fun . " after 30 minutes of play , the flood gates burst .
the pressure , and the condition of the professionals from germany , proved too great for san marino .
by the end of the first half , the score stood 6-0 on two goals by podolski , two from miroslav klose , one from michael ballack and another from bastian schweinsteiger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany forward lukas podolski celebrated after scoring one of his two goals .

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ?

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law .

" by his admission that the cia has indeed practiced illegal kidnapping and detention , bush exposes not only his own previous lies , " said sarah ludford .
" he also exposes to ridicule those arrogant government leaders in europe who dismissed as unfounded our fears about extraordinary rendition .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .

but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 07.09.2006 anti-americanism , homeschooling and happy housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the president , not the people , some europeans have a problem with dw-world.de readers this week commented on anti-americanism after sept .
11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism .
-lrb- sept .
4 , 2006 -rrb- delighted , not desperate , housewives what do women really want ?
definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 europe -pipe- 07.09.2006 uprooting terrorism in spain after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .
zapatero has offered them a landing runway .
if they choose not to use it , the end could be disastrous . " andreu jerez -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain convicts sept .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .
zapatero has offered them a landing runway .

" it 's extremely important for the government and the people of lebanon , " annan said in spain on the latest leg of his tour .
" now the government ... and the lebanese people can dedicate themselves again to reconstruction . " a devastating effect lebanese officials had blasted the continuing blockade as a violation of un resolution 1701 that brought an end to the conflict in which more than 1,200 lebanese , mostly civilians , and 160 israelis , mostly soldiers , were killed . the restrictions also had a devastating effect on the lebanese economy which imports 85 percent of its consumer goods . on top of the destruction of infrastructure , estimated to have cost $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , finance minister jihad azour said the war and blockade had increased lebanon 's public debt to $ 41 billion , more than twice gross domestic product of $ 18 billion , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon signals delay in requesting german troops the lebanese government has set preconditions for the deployment of a german naval peacekeeping force , saying israel must first lift its air and sea blockade .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.09.2006 interview with kidnapped girl attracts viewers - and critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition for natascha kampusch 's first interviews was fierce natascha kampusch - the 18-year-old kidnapping victim whose fate has riveted europe since she escaped after eight years of captivity - made her first public appearance wednesday . austrian teenager natascha kampusch showed both fragility and strength in her first interview since fleeing captivity last month . the tv interview garnered massive ratings - and not a little criticism . she told an austrian interviewer that she had never abandoned dreams of freedom , saying : " i only thought about fleeing . " kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .

2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .

finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .

the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law . " first acknowledgment bush on wednesday for the first time acknowledged that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .

most other detainees held abroad - less than 100 since 2001 - have been released or turned over for prosecution . breaching human rights the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg is the continent 's main human rights watchdog and is independent from the eu . its final report on a six-month inquiry into the cia charges said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . conducting a separate probe into the controversial issue , european lawmakers in june agreed to extend their investigation with a focus on trying to find out whether romania and poland have hosted illegal cia prisons .
both countries have denied the allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and romania have allegedly hosted secret prisons clandestine detention centers , secret flights via or from europe to countries where suspects could face torture or extraordinary renditions would all breach the continent 's human-rights conventions . exposed to ridicule the vice-chair of the european parliament 's special committee investigating cia prisons in europe said bush 's disclosure also puts european leaders in a bad light . " by his admission that the cia has indeed practiced illegal kidnapping and detention , bush exposes not only his own previous lies , " said sarah ludford .
" he also exposes to ridicule those arrogant government leaders in europe who dismissed as unfounded our fears about extraordinary rendition . " eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have long called on us officials to admit the us used a network of secret prisons and have transferred prisoners between them on covert flights .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ? " perfume , " an olfactory story if there ever was one , has been rendered by its missing sense , senseless . jochen kürten -lrb- tt / df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disappointment for germany at venice film festival germany 's contribution to this year 's venice film festival is respectable enough - but it could have been so much more .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .

but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment . " the berlin meeting is the first reunion of the five permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany , since iran defied the security council deadline . the six are offering iran talks on a package of trade , security and technology benefits if it freezes enrichment . discussing ambiguities in another development , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said thursday in spain that he plans to meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana within days to discuss what he said were " ambiguities " in the benefits offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic efforts have failed so far ali asghar soltanieh , the iranian ambassador in vienna to the un nuclear watchdog agency there , told afp that the larijani-solana meeting would be in the austrian capital , after having been postponed there wednesday . in tehran , a national security council official said that larijani wants to have " serious and constructive negotiations with the 5 plus 1 group ... especially on the nuclear question . " in berlin , " they 're going to talk about sanctions , and my guess is that they 're going to come up with not very much , " chicago-based non-proliferation expert gary samore said about the meeting of the six nations ' foreign ministry political directors . no decision-making a western diplomat said the gathering was " not a decision-making meeting .
it is the first conversation on where we go from here . " washington leads international concerns that iran is covertly trying to develop nuclear weapons , something tehran denies , and the us is also spearheading the push for sanctions .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment . " the berlin meeting is the first reunion of the five permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany , since iran defied the security council deadline . the six are offering iran talks on a package of trade , security and technology benefits if it freezes enrichment . discussing ambiguities in another development , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said thursday in spain that he plans to meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana within days to discuss what he said were " ambiguities " in the benefits offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic efforts have failed so far ali asghar soltanieh , the iranian ambassador in vienna to the un nuclear watchdog agency there , told afp that the larijani-solana meeting would be in the austrian capital , after having been postponed there wednesday . in tehran , a national security council official said that larijani wants to have " serious and constructive negotiations with the 5 plus 1 group ... especially on the nuclear question . " in berlin , " they 're going to talk about sanctions , and my guess is that they 're going to come up with not very much , " chicago-based non-proliferation expert gary samore said about the meeting of the six nations ' foreign ministry political directors . no decision-making a western diplomat said the gathering was " not a decision-making meeting .
it is the first conversation on where we go from here . " washington leads international concerns that iran is covertly trying to develop nuclear weapons , something tehran denies , and the us is also spearheading the push for sanctions .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.09.2006 interview with kidnapped girl attracts viewers - and critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition for natascha kampusch 's first interviews was fierce natascha kampusch - the 18-year-old kidnapping victim whose fate has riveted europe since she escaped after eight years of captivity - made her first public appearance wednesday . austrian teenager natascha kampusch showed both fragility and strength in her first interview since fleeing captivity last month . the tv interview garnered massive ratings - and not a little criticism . she told an austrian interviewer that she had never abandoned dreams of freedom , saying : " i only thought about fleeing . " kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom .

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment . " the berlin meeting is the first reunion of the five permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany , since iran defied the security council deadline . the six are offering iran talks on a package of trade , security and technology benefits if it freezes enrichment . discussing ambiguities in another development , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said thursday in spain that he plans to meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana within days to discuss what he said were " ambiguities " in the benefits offer .

" we will consider this from all points of view , in totality , based on our goal of not allowing the spread of wmd -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- and technology that is linked with this , " state-run ria novosti quoted him as saying . lavrov said however that russia still had reservations about imposing sanctions on iran and he underlined moscow 's opposition to military action . robert joseph , us under secretary of state for arms control and international security , said he believed a vote on sanctions could come this month , and he expected russia and china would sign on . the campaign picked up pace after president george w. bush on tuesday branded iran 's leaders " tyrants " and said they must not be allowed to get nuclear weapons , " the tools of mass murder .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 07.09.2006 anti-americanism , homeschooling and happy housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the president , not the people , some europeans have a problem with dw-world.de readers this week commented on anti-americanism after sept .
11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 07.09.2006 anti-americanism , homeschooling and happy housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the president , not the people , some europeans have a problem with dw-world.de readers this week commented on anti-americanism after sept .
11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law . " first acknowledgment bush on wednesday for the first time acknowledged that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .

" by his admission that the cia has indeed practiced illegal kidnapping and detention , bush exposes not only his own previous lies , " said sarah ludford .
" he also exposes to ridicule those arrogant government leaders in europe who dismissed as unfounded our fears about extraordinary rendition . " eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have long called on us officials to admit the us used a network of secret prisons and have transferred prisoners between them on covert flights .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment . " the berlin meeting is the first reunion of the five permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany , since iran defied the security council deadline . the six are offering iran talks on a package of trade , security and technology benefits if it freezes enrichment . discussing ambiguities in another development , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said thursday in spain that he plans to meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana within days to discuss what he said were " ambiguities " in the benefits offer .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .

" by his admission that the cia has indeed practiced illegal kidnapping and detention , bush exposes not only his own previous lies , " said sarah ludford .
" he also exposes to ridicule those arrogant government leaders in europe who dismissed as unfounded our fears about extraordinary rendition . " eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have long called on us officials to admit the us used a network of secret prisons and have transferred prisoners between them on covert flights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 07.09.2006 anti-americanism , homeschooling and happy housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the president , not the people , some europeans have a problem with dw-world.de readers this week commented on anti-americanism after sept .
11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .

i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment . " the berlin meeting is the first reunion of the five permanent un security council members britain , china , france , russia and the united states , plus germany , since iran defied the security council deadline . the six are offering iran talks on a package of trade , security and technology benefits if it freezes enrichment . discussing ambiguities in another development , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said thursday in spain that he plans to meet eu foreign policy chief javier solana within days to discuss what he said were " ambiguities " in the benefits offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic efforts have failed so far ali asghar soltanieh , the iranian ambassador in vienna to the un nuclear watchdog agency there , told afp that the larijani-solana meeting would be in the austrian capital , after having been postponed there wednesday . in tehran , a national security council official said that larijani wants to have " serious and constructive negotiations with the 5 plus 1 group ... especially on the nuclear question . " in berlin , " they 're going to talk about sanctions , and my guess is that they 're going to come up with not very much , " chicago-based non-proliferation expert gary samore said about the meeting of the six nations ' foreign ministry political directors . no decision-making a western diplomat said the gathering was " not a decision-making meeting .
it is the first conversation on where we go from here . " washington leads international concerns that iran is covertly trying to develop nuclear weapons , something tehran denies , and the us is also spearheading the push for sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed but russia and china , both iranian allies and major trading partners , are reluctant to take such measures , fearing they will worsen the current confrontation or even lead to war . mounting impatience in a sign of mounting international impatience , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said wednesday russia was considering support for security council economic sanctions against iran . " we will consider this from all points of view , in totality , based on our goal of not allowing the spread of wmd -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- and technology that is linked with this , " state-run ria novosti quoted him as saying . lavrov said however that russia still had reservations about imposing sanctions on iran and he underlined moscow 's opposition to military action . robert joseph , us under secretary of state for arms control and international security , said he believed a vote on sanctions could come this month , and he expected russia and china would sign on . the campaign picked up pace after president george w. bush on tuesday branded iran 's leaders " tyrants " and said they must not be allowed to get nuclear weapons , " the tools of mass murder .

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?

" kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law . " first acknowledgment bush on wednesday for the first time acknowledged that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri says he was kidnapped and tortured by the cia since media reports revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program . the us president also said that 14 high-profile terror detainees had been transferred from cia custody to guantanamo bay , for possible prosecution , adding that they would be protected by the geneva conventions .
most other detainees held abroad - less than 100 since 2001 - have been released or turned over for prosecution . breaching human rights the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg is the continent 's main human rights watchdog and is independent from the eu . its final report on a six-month inquiry into the cia charges said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . conducting a separate probe into the controversial issue , european lawmakers in june agreed to extend their investigation with a focus on trying to find out whether romania and poland have hosted illegal cia prisons .
both countries have denied the allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and romania have allegedly hosted secret prisons clandestine detention centers , secret flights via or from europe to countries where suspects could face torture or extraordinary renditions would all breach the continent 's human-rights conventions . exposed to ridicule the vice-chair of the european parliament 's special committee investigating cia prisons in europe said bush 's disclosure also puts european leaders in a bad light . " by his admission that the cia has indeed practiced illegal kidnapping and detention , bush exposes not only his own previous lies , " said sarah ludford .
" he also exposes to ridicule those arrogant government leaders in europe who dismissed as unfounded our fears about extraordinary rendition . " eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have long called on us officials to admit the us used a network of secret prisons and have transferred prisoners between them on covert flights .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .
known in policy circles simply as " the transformation , " it is due to be completed by 2010 . ' a good signal ' many agree that german military defense should include diverse international deployments , but they complain that funding for the plan has thus far been inadequate . " unexpected deployments need to be additionally financed , " said bernhard gertz , chief of a lobbying group called the german federal armed forces association -lrb- dbwv -rrb- .
" the defense minister ca n't be expected to finance it out of thin air .
that just is n't serious , or professional . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , in dr congo .
is he still living a cold war ? he welcomed merkel 's comments , calling them " a very good signal that the country 's leadership has gotten the message . "
gertz added that he would like to see the 28.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 36.5 billion -rrb- military budget increase by between 4 and 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 to $ 7 billion -rrb- over the next four years . for his part , wilfried stolze , a spokesman for the dbwv , said the money that is currently there is n't being used to best advantage . " we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .
the infantry of the future will communicate with laptopt and high-tech materials , " he said .
" international networking will be key . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers in kinshasa , dr congo - germany has 2,000 troops there it is generally accepted that cold war military goals should be replaced , but the question remains as to just what should replace them . where should germany draw the line between defending its own interests , and taking an active role in improving the political climate in the world at large ? call for more intelligent military mandate angelika beer , germany 's green party representative in the european parliament , warns that the country 's armed forces need a clearer mandate before military spending is increased . " if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said . ' we need specialists ' " jung is slowing down the -lrb- reform -rrb- process , in certain areas even turning it around , " by focusing on increasing the number of regular conscripts rather than trying to boost the number of paid military specialists , bonde argued . " we need specialists trained for missions , capable of contributing , " he said .
" i fear putting more money into the armed forces will not lead to new capacities where we need them , but will add to old capacities aimed at winning the cold war - which is not out there anymore . " but , he added , the conservatives are beginning to realize that the bundeswehr is not up to the challenges of today 's world . " i think -lrb- merkel -rrb- underestimates how much money and resources are wasted by our having the wrong structure , " he said .
" they 've underestimated the changes needed in the armed forces .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .

five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism .

after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ? " perfume , " an olfactory story if there ever was one , has been rendered by its missing sense , senseless . jochen kürten -lrb- tt / df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disappointment for germany at venice film festival germany 's contribution to this year 's venice film festival is respectable enough - but it could have been so much more .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .

five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .

" the summary outlines the conditions iran is setting for it to join in talks , namely that there is no movement -lrb- towards sanctions -rrb- against it in the security council , and this of course is unacceptable to the west , " said a diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue . in paris , french prime minister dominique de villepin told the national assembly : " iran 's response to the offer made by the international community is insufficient , notably concerning the need to suspend enrichment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic efforts have failed so far ali asghar soltanieh , the iranian ambassador in vienna to the un nuclear watchdog agency there , told afp that the larijani-solana meeting would be in the austrian capital , after having been postponed there wednesday . in tehran , a national security council official said that larijani wants to have " serious and constructive negotiations with the 5 plus 1 group ... especially on the nuclear question .

" we will consider this from all points of view , in totality , based on our goal of not allowing the spread of wmd -lrb- weapons of mass destruction -rrb- and technology that is linked with this , " state-run ria novosti quoted him as saying . lavrov said however that russia still had reservations about imposing sanctions on iran and he underlined moscow 's opposition to military action . robert joseph , us under secretary of state for arms control and international security , said he believed a vote on sanctions could come this month , and he expected russia and china would sign on . the campaign picked up pace after president george w. bush on tuesday branded iran 's leaders " tyrants " and said they must not be allowed to get nuclear weapons , " the tools of mass murder .

but an appeals court has overturned the case .
calling a cop a bull is ok in this day and age , usually . the incident occurred when two officers of the law rang the doorbell of a woman one morning , getting her out of bed .
after she answered the door , half-asleep , her daughter asked her , " those the bulls ? " " yes , " she replied .
" those are the bulls . " bull , or " bulle " in german , is a slang word for policeman - more negative than the american " cop " but not as disparaging as " pig . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is a bull ... but ca n't be called a cop .
but the two officers at the door felt their honor had been insulted .
they took advantage of a german law that can impose penalties on those who insult civil servants .
a local court agreed with them , but the woman charged took her case to an appeal court in the city of regensburg , which took a different view of the matter . it all depends on how you mean it - that " bull , " that is . the court ruled that " bulle " is widely used in oral speech , known by everyone , and is not necessarily meant to compare the police officers to " an easily excitable , aggressive animal that tends toward blind , unconsidered acts of violence . " however , the german lawyers information service has said that does n't mean people have carte blanche to call policemen and women that name , especially when it 's said with the goal to insult the officers of the law . next time you say " bulle " in front of a cop , it might be better to say it with a smile . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how to fight boredom in germany and land in jail being bored is not only an important part of the german philosophical tradition .

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician .

" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.09.2006 european officials slam us secret prisons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said that 14 suspects imprisoned abroad have been moved european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe . europe 's top human rights official called the us government 's actions in fighting the so-called war on terror " criminal " thursday and said that washington 's admission of secret cia prisons has justified european suspicions . " kidnapping people and torturing them in secret - however tempting the short-term gain may appear to be - is what criminals do , not democratic governments , " said council of europe president rene van der linden .
" in the long term , such practices create more terrorists and undermine the values we are fighting for .
europe will have no part in such a degrading system . " us president george w. bush 's admission that secret prisons run by the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- exist vindicated the council 's months-long investigation , van der linden said . " our work has helped to flush out the dirty nature of this secret war , which we learn at last , has been carried out completely beyond any legal framework , " he said .
" human rights violations committed in the fight against terrorism are in fact victories for the terrorists , whose very aim is to destroy the rule of law . " first acknowledgment bush on wednesday for the first time acknowledged that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri says he was kidnapped and tortured by the cia since media reports revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program . the us president also said that 14 high-profile terror detainees had been transferred from cia custody to guantanamo bay , for possible prosecution , adding that they would be protected by the geneva conventions .
most other detainees held abroad - less than 100 since 2001 - have been released or turned over for prosecution . breaching human rights the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg is the continent 's main human rights watchdog and is independent from the eu . its final report on a six-month inquiry into the cia charges said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . conducting a separate probe into the controversial issue , european lawmakers in june agreed to extend their investigation with a focus on trying to find out whether romania and poland have hosted illegal cia prisons .

the match was one of 21 european championship qualifying matches matches that took place on wednesday . not unusually , it took a while for the clear favorite to crack the defensive wall .

" i got up to the penalty spot and then the san marino players started saying ' fair play , fair play ! ' and so i thought it better to forget it and not humiliate the opponent . " bernd schneider , who again played a very good match , then converted the penalty kick .
captain ballack , who played just 45 minutes , said he was pleased with the result , and believes that the team is going down the right path . " when we come up against difficult opponents , we 'll have to adjust more to that team 's abilities , " he said .

created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion . instead , it has become increasingly active in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the world .
right now german soldiers are deployed in 11 international missions , from kosovo to the democratic republic of congo .
if germany sends troops to lebanon - currently under debate - that would make 12 . ' defense budget is not sacrosanct ' on wednesday , merkel told the german weekly die zeit that it is time for the country to take a new look at the role of the army .
" we must ask ourselves , overall , if our military structures are valid for the future , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel inspected some german naval sites last week she added that she would also consider increasing the military budget , pointing out that germany spends less on its army than finland , norway or holland , - and much less than italy , france , the uk or the us - in terms of percentage of gnp . " you can not say that the planned defense budget for the next 20 years is sacrosanct , " merkel said .
" a german government can not say , ' please , do n't take part in any new conflicts in the next decades , because we ca n't afford it , " ' she added . an official plan to modernize the bundeswehr - to turn it from an unwieldy behemoth created to defend its own borders into a lithe organization ready to take on asymmetric threats around the world - has been underway for several years .

" we do n't need heavy tanks any more - and we have 6,000 of them .
they 're good for the scrap heap .
what we need is light armored vehicles - hundreds of them .
and more air transport capacity .

" if ms. merkel wants to talk about increasing military spending despite the tight budget and a policy of cutbacks , then we really need to clarify the mandate of the military first , " beer said . a discussion over the role of the german armed forces is " long overdue , " she said .
" without a broad consensus on its mandate , there is a risk that the military will be called on every time policy fails . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany first got into the international peacekeeping game in kosovo green party bundestag parliamentarian alexander bonde , who sits on both the defense and budget committees , was also negative on merkel 's comments . the " transformation " of the military has taken a step in the wrong direction under franz-josef jung , the current defense minister , he said .

defender manuel friedrich also got his premiere goal in just his third game on the german team .
goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose yellow jersey remained unstained during the match , almost had a chance to score on a penalty kick just one minute from time . fair play ? " running up to take the kick , i was n't so sure because it seemed like humiliation , " the arsenal keeper said .
" i got up to the penalty spot and then the san marino players started saying ' fair play , fair play ! ' and so i thought it better to forget it and not humiliate the opponent . " bernd schneider , who again played a very good match , then converted the penalty kick .
captain ballack , who played just 45 minutes , said he was pleased with the result , and believes that the team is going down the right path . " when we come up against difficult opponents , we 'll have to adjust more to that team 's abilities , " he said .
" nevertheless , we want to play our style of soccer and we 've done that the last few weeks .

the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .

the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .
11 , when 94 percent of the population supported bush and his crisis management , which then lead to his reelection in nov .
2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar . " attacks change eta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , eta had no choice but to declare a permanent ceasefire but the consequences of march 11 went beyond partido popular 's loss of power .
spanish society and , above all , the basques unanimously condemned the terrorist attacks in madrid .
shortly after the brutal attacks , spokesperson for batasuna -lrb- eta 's political wing -rrb- arnaldo oteg expressed his absolute denunciation of the massacre . he also denied what aznar 's government assumed at first that eta was behind the attacks . " march 11 had a psychological effect on eta and the left , " said paul ríos , coordinator and spokesperson for lokarri , a citizen 's group fighting for freedom and reconciliation in basque country .
" the basque people unanimously condemned the attacks in madrid .
if eta were to commit such an act , then it would have become even more isolated than it already is . " consequently , march 11 brought about a change of strategy for eta . " you can not deny that march 11 sped up a discussion within eta about violence as a means of achieving political goals , " said gorka landaburu , a journalist and editor of the weekly cambio 16 .
" then there was also the rejection in society - both among the spaniards and the basques , the political pressure and international cooperation .
all this has lead eta and those close to it down the path of abandoning violence . " an irreversible process ? the fifth anniversary of sept .
11 coincides in spain with the peace process , which began in march with eta 's announcement of a " permanent ceasefire . "
at the end of june , zapatero responded to it by announcing talks with the terrorist organization .
that was the second most important milestone in the peace process meant to solve the so-called basque conflict . many people in spain talk nowadays about the supposedly irreversible nature of the peace process .
basque journalist gorka landaburu said he can not completely rule out possible backward steps in this process , but he remains , nonetheless , confident about the possibility of success . " the path is already sketched out and eta does n't have another way out , " he said .
" if it wants to keep defending the things it is defending , it will have to do that with the help of democratic institutions and earning the respect of the opponent .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after spain got hit by islamic terrorists , the basque terror group eta had to give up violence in view of the advance of international islamic terrorists , basque terrorist organization eta had to revise its violent strategies in spain .
the madrid bombings sealed this process in 2004 . as the world trade center collapsed on sept .
11 , 2001 , spain changed thoroughly .
the political reality of the country was not untouched by the greatest terrorist attack in history , which was also described by some as the actual beginning of the 21st century .
the intensification of international terrorism meant the beginning of the end of spanish internal terrorism and the basque terror organization eta . bush and aznar after al qaeda 's attack on the financial heart of the united states , us president george w. bush started a war against terrorism .
one of his main goals was to fight terrorists outside the united states .
but bush could not lead his crusade without the support of the west if he did n't want to gamble with its international legitimacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister blair -lrb- left -rrb- , us president bush and spain 's former prime minister jose maria aznar the american president could not only rely on the backing of the ever-faithful british prime minister tony blair , but also on the then spanish prime minister , the conservative josé maría aznar .
the famous meeting in the azores in march 2003 sealed this tripartite axis against international terrorism . washington rewarded aznar 's unlimited support by supporting the spanish prime minister in his fight against eta .
the us state department put eta members on its black list of international terrorists .
this helped block the flow of finances to eta and increased the cooperation in prosecuting members of the organization in other countries .
currently , around 150 eta members in french prisons .
finally , aznar managed to integrate his fight against the basque terrorist organizations into the global crusade lead by his ally george w. bush . march 11 was the spanish sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was shocked by the terrorist attack of march 11 , 2004 on march 11 , 2004 , aznar - and , with him , the whole country - paid a high price for cooperating with bush .
the attacks of islamic terrorists in madrid left almost 200 people dead and hundreds injured .
the attacks took place three days before the parliamentary elections , which were expected to be clearly won by partido popular -lrb- pp -rrb- , whose candidate mariano rajoy was seen as aznar 's successor .
aznar 's unambiguous support for the iraq war and bush had not left a mark on spanish voters . despite the expectations , pp lost the elections on march 14 .
today , spain is governed by the socialist josé rordrígez zapatero .
so why did n't spain react in the same way that the us did after sept .

2004 ? " spain is certainly of the most experienced western countries as far as the phenomenon of terrorism is concerned , " said peter waldemann , a sociology professor at the university of augsburg .
" that is why public opinion there has a very strong attitude about the successes , but also the limits of hard-line politics .
as a consequence , spain does not follow the rule that a crisis caused by a terrorist attack is advantageous for hard-line politicians such as bush , sharon , putin or even aznar .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?
nobody is stopping her !
why is it that there are always women like her who are trying so hard to please men that they do n't mind making every other woman 's life miserable ?
feminism does n't stop any woman from being as " feminine " as she wishes to be .
feminism just wants women to have a choice - which is only right and fair !
as for what 's good for society : just look at the countries where women have no rights .
would you really want to live in one of them ?
there is a reason why they usually are in poor shape : they are ignoring or suppressing the talents of half their population . - i n ga schwarzkopf , usa this dear woman is very much on the right track .
men would do anything for women with this aura and philosophy .
feminists have set back european and us women .
yes , bring it on - far less words , and much more tupperware ! - howard fleischer compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism .

11 , homeschooling and a german tv presenter 's reverse emancipation theory . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . when the world thinks of america , they tend to think of our leaders .
i feel that is a huge mistake .
george bush has indeed hurt our reputation around the world with his cowboy attitude .
the american people are warm by nature and we care about others .
it is true that after sept .
11 , we rallied around our leaders because we were hurting .
now , our leaders ' policies do not represent the voice of america .
i would like europeans to know that it is our leaders , not the people who have opened a hornets ' nest in the middle east . - chris hah n it is my belief that the reason americans fill uneasy is because most have woke up and found out we are not god .
we are not a superpower .
a superpower is both militarily and morally strong .
a superpower would not try to force its ideas onto others , especially one that is suppose to be based on freedom of belief , freedom of speech , freedom of religion and self determination , yet as american we should feel uneasy because we have strayed away from those ideas . - ra n dy cli n e i lived in chicago for a number of years before eventually going to the east coast , before coming to germany .
i must say that overall i feel safer in germany than i did in some places in america .
in chicago one has to fear being mugged or worse .
since the attacks on sept .
11 , i do n't think anyone has any illusions that our own land is better protected than any other .
my sister told me a day of the attacks that it looks like war and i should come home where i will be safer .
i told her i would stay here where it is safer .
i have only had one incident that i can relate to being " anti-american " and it came actually from a " friend . "
so i would say from my experience any feeling of anti-americanism is probably overrated . - a n dy spor n er homeschooli n g i am from the us , which may turn one off to reading my opinions on homeschooling , as it has become quite acceptable as a choice in education .
for me , it clearly boils down to a choice made by parents for their own children .
no government should have rights over parents , except in cases of abuse and neglect , where someone must intervene for the safety of the children .
homeschooling is loosely-stringently regulated in the us , depending on the state that one lives in .
there may be cases of poor homeschooling , but most statistics show positive results .
there will always be cases of poor parenting , but the educational system can not change everything .
parents in germany should have the right to choose how they wish to educate their children , whether public , private , or via homeschooling .
i can say from experience that many will not choose homeschooling if it is made legal - it is a difficult road .
most who do choose such a path will have a determination to provide a good education for their children and will find a way to do so at home . - krissi wyss bildunterschrift : do homeschooled kids loose out on interaction with others ? i do not think that germany should allow homeschooling .
we already have a huge problem here with immigrants -lrb- please remember that i am an immigrant myself ! -rrb- - especially women and children - being kept at home by their male relatives due to religion and cultures that they have brought with them and therefore those women and children can not speak basic german and know virtually nothing of their rights or obligations in germany .
in addition to basic education , going to school is an absolutely vital mechanism to socialize children - to simply get them used to dealing with other people who are not their immediate family members .
i have already been alarmed for years at the sheer lack of social skills which children whose mothers stay at home full-time to care for them have , and that is largely due to inadequate contact with other children and other people in general .
i have friends in australia who were solely educated at home , and they took literally years once they became adults to acquire basic social skills and relax in " public " company - they found it very stressful to meet and mix with people they did not know , and they found that they did not know the " rules " of human social interaction which obviously everyone around them did know .
given that the majority of schools in germany have only half-day schooling anyway , why on earth ca n't parents who want to " home-school " their children here do it in the afternoons ? - tri n a mell , australia n livi n g i n germa n y in my opinion , it is not a very good idea to introduce homeschooling .
this is basically denying the children their right to intermingle for a general personality development .
homeschooling would make them stereotypes .
the german government should instead introduce a broad curriculum in the schools including the subjects involving religion .
those interested will then have the choice to opt what suits their needs . - peer zada eva herma n 's reversed ema n cipatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman thinks a woman does a much better job keeping the home clean and comfy why does n't this lady simply follow her own advice : shut up , go home , and take care of five kids -lrb- adopted , if need be -rrb- ?

" kampusch , who appeared poised in the interview , was snatched off a vienna street in 1998 when she was 10 .
she spent eight years in a dungeon-like cell in the basement of the home of her captor , wolfgang priklopil .
priklopil committed suicide after kampusch escaped on aug .
23 . media fre n zy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's countrymen avidly watched her interview at austrian television channel orf in vienna .
kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .
it showed a " strong , pretty young woman " when in reality kampusch is a " small , wounded girl , who has lived through hell , " he said . a " very , very early " move " from a therapeutic point of view , i would have strongly advised her against " giving the interview , he said . german criminologist christian pfeifer also told afp that it was " very , very early " to go public with kampusch 's story , saying that " her body language continued to show all the signs of being a captive .

kampusch 's escape set off a media feeding frenzy .
the interest in her case is so intense in europe that even the bidding war for the interview became a subject of intense speculation .
in the end kampusch - whose team of aides now includes a media representative as well as psychologists - chose the news program on austrian public broadcaster orf to make her first public appearance . in germany , the rights to the interview were bought by private television station rtl , which reported viewership of more than 7 million , or nearly 23 percent of the audience . in the interview , kampusch said she had thought at times about decapitating her kidnapper , a 44-year-old telecoms technician . " sometimes i dreamt of chopping his head off , if i had an axe , " she said .
" you see how the brain works when it 's looking for a solution .
i kept thinking , i surely was not born to let myself be locked up and have my life ruined . " a " story of freedom " kampusch made clear that her extraordinary story , which has brought 50 foreign television crews to vienna , was about freedom . " i am a great lover of freedom , " she said .
" i am thoroughly drunk with the thought of freedom . " i always sought the moment when the time would be right , but i could not risk anything , " the young woman said about her escape , adding that " a failed attempt could have meant i would never come out of the dungeon . " kampusch fled when priklopil , who occasionally let her out of her claustrophobic cell to accompany him and work on his house , got distracted by a telephone call while she was vacuuming his car . she said her escape was " completely spontaneous " and that she just " ran when i saw him on the telephone . " limited questio n s # b # on television , kampusch , wearing jeans and a purple shirt with a long pink and purple scarf tied around her head , appeared relaxed and often smiling , even joking at times with the interviewer . suffering from a cold however , she spoke with a hoarse voice and often closed her eyes against the light as she told orf of her attempts to attract attention when she was out with her kidnapper . she said priklopil threatened to harm anybody who tried to help her and so she never cried for help . kampusch had said in advance of the interviews that she would not answer questions about her personal life , including speculation that she had intimate relations with priklopil . criticism from observers she also refused to talk about her captor , saying it would be unfair since he was not there to defend himself . the interview itself was followed by the inevitable rash of media analysis .
it seems no tv program or newspaper in europe wanted to miss their chance to comment on details of the young woman 's appearance . the intense bidding war for kampusch 's story was also a topic for media commentary . several observers criticized kampusch and her handlers , saying they went public too soon . german child psychologist christian lüdke , who specializes in treating victims of attacks or kidnappings , told afp that kampusch 's first public appearance gave a " completely false image " of the victim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2006 bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scent of a woman about to be murdered reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .
after all , how does one transform the book 's central topic , exquisite scent , into images on the big screen ? it is one of the most-awaited films in years : the adaptation of patrick süskind 's bestselling novel " perfume , " which sold more than 15 million copies and was translated into 40 languages .
süskind had originally refused to sell the rights to the novel , but relented after long negotiations with german producer bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall , " " the house of spirits " -rrb- .
the film is slated to open in mid-september . the movie has a stellar cast , featuring dustin hoffman and alan rickman in supporting roles , as well as one of the most successful german directors of a younger generation , tom tykwer -lrb- " run , lola , run , " " heaven " -rrb- , who has adapted the novel fairly faithfully , although there are problems with the film . faithful , but flawed adaptation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy award winning actor dustin hoffman in a supporting role set in 18th century france , it is the story of a man with a phenomenal sense of smell who lives his life as a perennial outsider , eventually turning to murder .
obsessed by the scent of women , jean-baptiste grenouille , played by the acclaimed young british actor ben whishaw , murders his young , female victims in order to literally squeeze out and preserve their individual scents . " this is not a story about a weird fantasy world with a crazy guy who by mere chance has a great sense of smell , " said tykwer in a deutsche welle interview .
" rather , this is the story of a man who is horribly lonely , which is a classic literary and cinematic motif . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer bernd eichinger selected tom tykwer to direct the film tykwer says he wants to reach the largest possible audience with his new movie .
he was more interested in the general appeal of the movie 's protagonist rather than the bizarre twists of the plot .
to him , the character is interesting because he is tormented by a conflict very much in existence today : social incompetence and an inability to sell himself . " this is something that we can all secretly identify with - the stress of having to always sell ourselves , to impress others , " he said . tykwer 's imprint is hard to fathom in " perfume , " a lurid thriller unfolds against a historical backdrop , complete with an arsenal of rich characters .
the story is compelling and passionately told , sparkles with sumptuous scenery and a host of brilliant performances . however , tykwer fails to develop his main character sufficiently for the film to really work .
how does an eccentric youth with an extraordinary olfactory sense , suddenly become such a monster ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production costs gobbled up over 50 million euros " in its overall immoral sense , it is finally a moral story , " explained tykwer .
" the shattering of this character in his greatest moment of triumph is somehow reassuring . as i see it , i can only do my best to enhance , to spice up appearances , but at the end of the day , my own shortcomings become evident .
i am also only somebody , the way we are all anybody . " although production costs exceeded 50 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- , " perfume , " which was widely regarded as a book that could n't be brought to the screen , might still be considered unfilmable despite tykwer 's efforts .
how is it possible to transpose a sensual tale of smells and fragrances to a cinematic medium that relies on audio-visual stimulation ? " perfume , " an olfactory story if there ever was one , has been rendered by its missing sense , senseless . jochen kürten -lrb- tt / df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : disappointment for germany at venice film festival germany 's contribution to this year 's venice film festival is respectable enough - but it could have been so much more .

mirza tahir hussain , 36 , faces execution for killing a taxi driver .
he told the bbc 's asian network : " i appeal to the conscience and good humanity of president musharraf to pardon or commute my death sentence .
" i also call upon tony blair to use the relationship britain has with pakistan to bring me home . "
he said : " i 'd like to thank everybody who has campaigned for me particularly the people of leeds , amnesty international , the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- and the british high commissioner in islamabad .
" please mr blair , take me home - i have suffered enough .
my life is to be terminated .
i miss my mum , my brother , my nephews , my elders , teachers , family and friends . "
islamic court mr hussain claims he killed the taxi driver in self-defence .
after several trials , pakistan 's high court threw out his guilty verdict , citing flawed evidence .
but he was then retried by an islamic court , which sentenced him to death .
despite pleas from his family and senior uk politicians , including the prime minister and the foreign secretary , he has not been freed .
previous stays of execution have expired and now only president musharraf can grant him a pardon or commute the sentence .

an official said 20 men entered the bar in uruapan city , michoacan state , fired into the air , forced revellers to lie down and then " threw down five heads " .
the men also left behind a note saying the act was " divine justice " carried out on behalf of " the family " .
michoacan state 's pacific coastline has become a haven for drug traffickers .
magdalena guzman , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office , told the associated press news agency investigators believed the beheadings may be linked to drug smugglers .
" no one who was at the bar wants to talk because they are afraid , " ms guzman said .
" they were stunned . "
the group of men , dressed in black and carrying rifles and handguns , burst into the bar shortly after midnight on wednesday morning , officials said .
they fired into the air , ordered everyone to lie down and placed the heads on the floor .
a note they left behind said : " the family does not kill for money .
it does not kill women or innocent people .
those who die are those who must die .
everyone should know that this is divine justice . "
the victims have yet to be identified .
authorities have found 13 decapitated bodies in michoacan this year .
mexico 's president-elect , felipe calderon , hails from michoacan state and has vowed to curb drug violence .

christopher sleight reports .
there is an excited atmosphere in lecture room m040 at the mathematics institute of cardiff university .
there 's a lively discussion about pluto 's recent loss of planet status , but the hot topic of conversation is about life in outer space .
the idea is being discussed earnestly and with scientific references - this is no x-files-style convention , but a gathering of eminent scientists and academics from around the globe .
they are here for a conference on panspermia and to hear from one of its leading proponents , prof wickramasinghe .
the sri lankan-born academic , who has just retired from his chair at the university after 33 years , is a passionate believer that we are not alone in the universe .
he freely admits his work is often met with " unabashed hostility " .
no evidence has turned up that would make me rethink the idea that life came from space prof wickramasinghe more diplomatically minded fellow scientists have called his theories " optimistic " .
others have described them as a " joke " , " ridiculous " - even an " unpardonable heresy " .
but the 67-year-old professor takes his ideas very seriously .
" i 'm completely convinced that we 're right .
if one had a wrong theory , then sooner or later you would have a conflict with observations , " he says .
" but everything that has happened since 1977 - when we first put forward these ideas - has gone in the direction confirming it , not disproving or falsifying it .
" no evidence has turned up that would make me rethink the idea that life came from space . "
many scientists recently criticised the professor for his claims that the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and the flu outbreak in 2000 both came from outer space .
the professor , who remains at cardiff university as director of astrobiology , claimed that solar activity brought cosmic dust containing the virus into the earth 's atmosphere .
the theory was not universally accepted , to say the least .
it has been much the same for the last 30 years , when prof wickramasinghe first unveiled his theories to the wider scientific community .
he says the conference convened to discuss the idea of panspermia in 1981 at the university of maryland simply tried to debunk the idea .
" it was a group of people who thought they could talk us out of pursuing this crazy idea that life came from space , " he says .
over the past three decades he has also received threatening mail and phone calls because of his ideas " on many occasions " .
it is something that irritated him at first , but not now that his theories are becoming a lot more accepted , he says .
" the general idea that life on earth is part of a long chain of connections that extends all the way to the remotest corners of the universe - this idea is beginning to become almost mainstream in science .
i think the universe must be teeming with sentient life ... sooner or later we will make contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence prof wickramasinghe " i think the idea is becoming more accepted - so much so that there is huge investment in looking for life from space . "
he admits there is still a " huge amount of work " to do in the area , but he remains convinced that conclusive evidence will soon prove that life can exist in the extremes of space .
he says he will continue to ignore his detractors .
" it 's essentially a pre-copernican attitude .
before the middle of the 15th century the earth was thought to be the centre of the universe .
" galileo and copernicus and others at that time essentially disproved that point of view , but it took a long struggle for people to abandon the earth-centred view point , " he says .
" when you look at the detailed nature of life in terms of molecular complexity it seems extremely unreasonable to suppose that on this tiny speck of dust - which is all that the earth is - the most complex physical system originated .
" i think the universe must be teeming with sentient life ... sooner or later we will make contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence . "

many muslims in new york have been through a period of reflection since 11 september 2001 , looking out at the wider us and wondering where they fit into it .
and they have been looking inwards , to work out what kind of islam sits easily with their lives .
take the case of nafisa degani who worked for the insurance company , aon , on the 100th floor of the world trade center 's south tower .
she was in her office when the first plane hit the north tower .
" all of us just stood up and looked out and saw this plane crash into tower one and it was just like at eye level , " she said .
" i stood there stupefied for a few seconds and we all thought it was pure accident - that he had lost control and that he had gone in .
and it took a few seconds - i stood there , and a few seconds later a huge flame shot out and the fire was so close .
" i took my bag and i was just yelling , run , run . "
hijackers ' motivation against the official advice to stay put , ms degani left her desk and descended .
half-way down the stairs , she felt the building shake as the second plane hit the tower above her .
she escaped while her friends died , and the whole experience made her assess her whole life including her faith in islam .
she says it has made her stronger in her faith .
she has thought hard about the motivation of the hijackers who killed her friends - rejecting the hijackers ' version of islam as a perversion .
" firstly , islam means peace - where was the peace in this ?
this islam is just made up , " she said .
" it is nothing to do with islam and these terrorists that take their own lives doing these kinds of acts - no religion permits that .
" so it is in the name of islam but it has , as far as i 'm concerned , nothing to do with the religion of islam " .
ms degani also re-ordered her own life .
she tried to eliminate what was not working or important , and for her that meant getting divorced -lrb- something she says muslim women very rarely initiate -rrb- .
community 's role just as individual muslims have re-examined their lives , so have communities .
at the muslim center of new york , in queens , boys aged from seven to 14 rock back and forth as they memorise the koran .
it is a scene from thousands of mosques in the pakistan many of their families left - except this is the us , with a very american attitude at the top .
the imam , syamsi ali , says he wants to bind people to the us , training young people who he hopes will become leaders in the law , medicine or engineering .
since 11 september , muslims in new york have become much more outgoing , he thinks .
" i used to attend meetings of the imams ' council and i used to find many imams who were very , very unfriendly towards others .
but after 11 september , they started realising that we need to open ourselves , " he said .
" before 11 september it was not easy to receive interfaith leaders in the mosques because of the perceptions - some middle eastern perception - that mosques are for muslims only .
" but after 11 september , that changed .
the mosque was opened , we organised many interfaith seminars , meetings where we reached out to the people . "
changing attitudes new york 's muslims say they feel various pulls on them - this desire to be part of the us , but also some resentment from some of the rest of the country .
many muslims say they face discrimination at work , or hostile looks on public transport .
omar mohammedi of the council on american-islamic relations in new york , a civil rights lawyer , said he was taking cases brought by muslims who had been fired from their jobs .
he was also representing a child who had been bullied in school because his name was " osama " .
observers say there does seem to have been a change in muslim attitudes since 11 september , with a much more determined rejection of isolation .
what it is impossible to know , though , is to what extent there are american muslims who go the other way .
analysts say home-grown terrorism seems less likely than in europe , because integration of communities is greater .
even in enclaves of people of pakistani descent in the us , there is a mix , with hispanics and indians often living in the same street , their shops next to each other .
on top of that , pakistanis who settle in the us generally do better , economically , compared with those who settle in the uk , many of whom fled poverty in kashmir .
all the same , it only takes one alienated muslim youth to act on his anger and then all the goodwill of thoughtful , active muslim leaders in new york will count for little .

it has helped him overcome a fear of flying , inspired his job , and made him friends around the world .
he explains how the science fiction show has changed his life . "
i actually watched my first episode when i was three years old in 1983 .
i enjoyed it but , at that point , i was watching inspector gadget and he-man as well , so i did n't really think too much of it .
but a number of years later i saw a video and thought : ' i remember watching that .
i 'll buy that ' .

star trek fan david holley the morals that come through on every story are absolutely superb - about race , religion and culture - even sexual orientation at times .
it made a big , big difference in my life and influenced me to become non-xenophobic and non-racist .
career guidance after university , i became deputy manager of a training provider helping multicultural people .
some of them could n't speak a word of english , and some had gone through the education system and failed .
they had been looked upon as people who just could n't achieve in life in regards of their age , their race , or their ability to communicate .
every single night i would cast my mind back and think to myself : ' what would patrick stewart do in this situation ? '
the show 's message of tolerance for others inspired david 's career and i thought maybe i could , with a bit of education , develop that and hopefully make a difference within yorkshire .
i decided to go and teach myself again and i got into the different legislations , and ended up as a diversity consultant , working with a black and ethnic minority housing association .
the one thing which i 've learnt from star trek , quite simply , is to respect everybody , every culture and every life you come across - even if it 's just for the briefest second .
when i was 18 years old i lost my mum in a car accident , and i actually used star trek as a bit of a comfort blanket .
the show deals with that on a day-to-day basis .
the loss of family and how you deal with certain things .
there 's always different connotations within each show which teach us how to deal with everyday life .
it 's told me never to give up , to keep on trying to do as much as you can do .
fear of flying it was always my dream to go out across america and try and visit some of the different locations where they filmed star trek .
there was only one snag in that , unlike most of the star trek characters who flew across the galaxy , i was actually afraid to fly across in a plane .
david once dressed as the character quark from deep space nine so i actually had to combat that , and i ended up in las vegas , where they have the star trek experience .
it was absolutely phenomenal and gave me the chance to almost touch part of the show which has obviously touched my life and had a huge effect on me .
as a trekker , you meet all sorts .
we go about our business and we 're not all dressed up in different outfits .
dare i say it , i 've only done that once in my whole life - as quark , the barman from deep space nine .
we 're basically a big extended family , which is really how the world should exist anyway - and that 's how it existed in the show .

the final public consultation is being held in kendal on thursday afternoon .
protest organisers said around 5,000 people took to the streets of the town on saturday to oppose the plans .
the campaigners claim the move is a cost-cutting measure , which will mean longer travelling times for patients with potentially life-threatening illnesses .

he said : " the reality of the situation is that if you have a heart attack you need a hospital which is close enough and good enough to treat your condition .
" i 'm convinced that this community could comfortably raise the money needed to buy better equipment .

david budd , middlesbrough council 's executive member for regeneration , added : " our partners who are funding mima have been very understanding about what in the scheme of things , is a fairly short delay .
