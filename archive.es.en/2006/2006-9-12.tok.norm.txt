conservative politicians blame spanish pm zapatero 's immigration laws for attracting even more .
but is their criticism founded ? the pictures on european television screens portray a drama that the continent has seldom seen before .
pictures of african refugees , bodies emaciated with tired , bloodshot eyes , wrapped in blankets being helped on shore by spanish police and security forces .
the message the images intend to send : whoever risks this voyage , risks his life . but what continental europeans are led , or want , to believe , is distorted according to the author of the article " venir en europe : mode d 'emploi " on the internet site www.senegalaisement.com.
the writer says that chances of dying on the trip to the canaries are next to zero , as long as the " security measures " are respected . how to reach europe on the cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of boats like these have reached the canaries in 2006 the journeys to the spanish islands located off the northwest african coast on boats that hardly look seaworthy are according to the author " a good solution for senegalese men , " particularly for young men .
all the details about how to reach europe , including a price list can be found on the web site . a place on a boat with a " good motor " costs around 4,500 euros -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- per person .
the traveler has to add a bit more for " safety equipment , " gasoline and food .
but once the difficult journey is completed , the most " open country in the world " awaits , according to senegalaisement.com.
the reader finds out that the life of a refugee in spain is comfortable and that the iberian country " holds the world record for legalizing immigrants . " eu openly critical such outspoken words from immigrants reaffirm the beliefs of spain 's conservatives that socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has opened the flood gates for waves of uncontrolled immigration to the country .
the opposition is particularly critical of zapatero 's decision last year to grant illegal immigrants legal status .
it is a decision that in their eyes attracted even more africans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero has taken much flak for his policy even the normally staid eu commission took a shot at madrid 's new policy .
eu interior and justice commissioner franco frattini accused zapatero 's legalization policy of drawing illegal immigrants to spain . alone in this year , 20,000 have landed on the coast of the canaries , four times that from 2005 .
zapatero has tried to stem the tide .
in a radio interview , he said spain " would n't accept clandestine or illegal immigration . "
only the help of the eu and more decisive actions from african countries would throttle the flow of immigrants .
nevertheless , the spanish leader said his country needs foreign workers - but only ones who travel with proper papers .
illegal immigration is deceit and a violation to a peaceful coexistence of all people in spain . ngos : no magnet for immigrants zapatero can depend on support from most refugee organizations for his policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of an immigrant 's journey or start of a new life ?
" it is n't a magnet .
the people are n't coming for work papers , they are just coming for work , " said juan miralles of the refugee agency andaluica acoge .
" that is purely a political argument .
that is also wrong . " " you ca n't say that more immigrants are coming .
it 's just that most are choosing to make their way over the atlantic to the canary islands .
the classic routes over -lrb- the exclaves -rrb- ceuta and melilla , or across the straits of gibralter have become practically impassable because they are being patrolled more tightly . " last chance to spain or better chances at home not only has the route to spain changed , but also the timing .
despite possibly being granted legal status , there is a fear among africans they may never have the chance to make it to continental europe . " most think : ' if i do n't flee now , then there wo n't be another chance .
tomorrow might be too late if the eu tightens its policies , " said jose palazon from the organization prodein .
african refugees know that once on spanish territory , there is little chance of them being repatriated since spain has no extradition agreements with most african countries . immigrants from africa in spain say that the only way to stop the flow is to make life better for potential refugees in their own country . " europe should n't send us any money that will then be wasted by politicians .
instead , they should help create jobs for young people , " said andre menda from a club of senegalese immigrants in the province of roquetas . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
" every time we met at a party , we 'd go to a corner and talk politics . " controversial moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fest 's book on hitler 's last days was later turned into a movie fest helped nazi official and architect albert speer , who became the only one of hitler 's henchmen to publicly repent for his crimes , when he wrote his autobiography " inside the third reich " -lrb- 1970 -rrb- .
speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning .

the writer says that chances of dying on the trip to the canaries are next to zero , as long as the " security measures " are respected . how to reach europe on the cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of boats like these have reached the canaries in 2006 the journeys to the spanish islands located off the northwest african coast on boats that hardly look seaworthy are according to the author " a good solution for senegalese men , " particularly for young men .
all the details about how to reach europe , including a price list can be found on the web site . a place on a boat with a " good motor " costs around 4,500 euros -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- per person .
the traveler has to add a bit more for " safety equipment , " gasoline and food .
but once the difficult journey is completed , the most " open country in the world " awaits , according to senegalaisement.com.
the reader finds out that the life of a refugee in spain is comfortable and that the iberian country " holds the world record for legalizing immigrants . " eu openly critical such outspoken words from immigrants reaffirm the beliefs of spain 's conservatives that socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has opened the flood gates for waves of uncontrolled immigration to the country .
the opposition is particularly critical of zapatero 's decision last year to grant illegal immigrants legal status .
it is a decision that in their eyes attracted even more africans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero has taken much flak for his policy even the normally staid eu commission took a shot at madrid 's new policy .
eu interior and justice commissioner franco frattini accused zapatero 's legalization policy of drawing illegal immigrants to spain . alone in this year , 20,000 have landed on the coast of the canaries , four times that from 2005 .
zapatero has tried to stem the tide .
in a radio interview , he said spain " would n't accept clandestine or illegal immigration . "
only the help of the eu and more decisive actions from african countries would throttle the flow of immigrants .
nevertheless , the spanish leader said his country needs foreign workers - but only ones who travel with proper papers .
illegal immigration is deceit and a violation to a peaceful coexistence of all people in spain . ngos : no magnet for immigrants zapatero can depend on support from most refugee organizations for his policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of an immigrant 's journey or start of a new life ?
" it is n't a magnet .
the people are n't coming for work papers , they are just coming for work , " said juan miralles of the refugee agency andaluica acoge .
" that is purely a political argument .
that is also wrong . " " you ca n't say that more immigrants are coming .
it 's just that most are choosing to make their way over the atlantic to the canary islands .
the classic routes over -lrb- the exclaves -rrb- ceuta and melilla , or across the straits of gibralter have become practically impassable because they are being patrolled more tightly . " last chance to spain or better chances at home not only has the route to spain changed , but also the timing .
despite possibly being granted legal status , there is a fear among africans they may never have the chance to make it to continental europe . " most think : ' if i do n't flee now , then there wo n't be another chance .
tomorrow might be too late if the eu tightens its policies , " said jose palazon from the organization prodein .
african refugees know that once on spanish territory , there is little chance of them being repatriated since spain has no extradition agreements with most african countries . immigrants from africa in spain say that the only way to stop the flow is to make life better for potential refugees in their own country . " europe should n't send us any money that will then be wasted by politicians .
instead , they should help create jobs for young people , " said andre menda from a club of senegalese immigrants in the province of roquetas . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
" every time we met at a party , we 'd go to a corner and talk politics . " controversial moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fest 's book on hitler 's last days was later turned into a movie fest helped nazi official and architect albert speer , who became the only one of hitler 's henchmen to publicly repent for his crimes , when he wrote his autobiography " inside the third reich " -lrb- 1970 -rrb- .
speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .
his book of memoirs entitled " not i " will be published in the coming weeks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the günter grass case : a " thoroughly german " scandal four weeks after günter grass publicly acknowledged that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops at the end of wwii , the debate is still raging over the implications of his confession .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly .

the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .

speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .
his book of memoirs entitled " not i " will be published in the coming weeks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the günter grass case : a " thoroughly german " scandal four weeks after günter grass publicly acknowledged that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops at the end of wwii , the debate is still raging over the implications of his confession .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .

that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .

we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .

in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .

the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .

chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .

conservative politicians blame spanish pm zapatero 's immigration laws for attracting even more .
but is their criticism founded ? the pictures on european television screens portray a drama that the continent has seldom seen before .
pictures of african refugees , bodies emaciated with tired , bloodshot eyes , wrapped in blankets being helped on shore by spanish police and security forces .
the message the images intend to send : whoever risks this voyage , risks his life . but what continental europeans are led , or want , to believe , is distorted according to the author of the article " venir en europe : mode d 'emploi " on the internet site www.senegalaisement.com.
the writer says that chances of dying on the trip to the canaries are next to zero , as long as the " security measures " are respected . how to reach europe on the cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of boats like these have reached the canaries in 2006 the journeys to the spanish islands located off the northwest african coast on boats that hardly look seaworthy are according to the author " a good solution for senegalese men , " particularly for young men .
all the details about how to reach europe , including a price list can be found on the web site . a place on a boat with a " good motor " costs around 4,500 euros -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- per person .
the traveler has to add a bit more for " safety equipment , " gasoline and food .
but once the difficult journey is completed , the most " open country in the world " awaits , according to senegalaisement.com.
the reader finds out that the life of a refugee in spain is comfortable and that the iberian country " holds the world record for legalizing immigrants . " eu openly critical such outspoken words from immigrants reaffirm the beliefs of spain 's conservatives that socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has opened the flood gates for waves of uncontrolled immigration to the country .
the opposition is particularly critical of zapatero 's decision last year to grant illegal immigrants legal status .
it is a decision that in their eyes attracted even more africans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero has taken much flak for his policy even the normally staid eu commission took a shot at madrid 's new policy .
eu interior and justice commissioner franco frattini accused zapatero 's legalization policy of drawing illegal immigrants to spain . alone in this year , 20,000 have landed on the coast of the canaries , four times that from 2005 .
zapatero has tried to stem the tide .
in a radio interview , he said spain " would n't accept clandestine or illegal immigration . "
only the help of the eu and more decisive actions from african countries would throttle the flow of immigrants .
nevertheless , the spanish leader said his country needs foreign workers - but only ones who travel with proper papers .
illegal immigration is deceit and a violation to a peaceful coexistence of all people in spain . ngos : no magnet for immigrants zapatero can depend on support from most refugee organizations for his policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of an immigrant 's journey or start of a new life ?
" it is n't a magnet .
the people are n't coming for work papers , they are just coming for work , " said juan miralles of the refugee agency andaluica acoge .
" that is purely a political argument .
that is also wrong . " " you ca n't say that more immigrants are coming .
it 's just that most are choosing to make their way over the atlantic to the canary islands .
the classic routes over -lrb- the exclaves -rrb- ceuta and melilla , or across the straits of gibralter have become practically impassable because they are being patrolled more tightly . " last chance to spain or better chances at home not only has the route to spain changed , but also the timing .
despite possibly being granted legal status , there is a fear among africans they may never have the chance to make it to continental europe . " most think : ' if i do n't flee now , then there wo n't be another chance .
tomorrow might be too late if the eu tightens its policies , " said jose palazon from the organization prodein .
african refugees know that once on spanish territory , there is little chance of them being repatriated since spain has no extradition agreements with most african countries . immigrants from africa in spain say that the only way to stop the flow is to make life better for potential refugees in their own country . " europe should n't send us any money that will then be wasted by politicians .
instead , they should help create jobs for young people , " said andre menda from a club of senegalese immigrants in the province of roquetas . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw .

" both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .

" both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .

it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .

speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .

2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .

" iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .

last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .

" i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .
they made plans to resume talks later this week . security council insists on suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana : misunderstandings were cleared up on the weekend and talks would continue director of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei welcomed the talks between the eu and tehran in his opening speech at an iaea conference monday in vienna . " i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .
the un security council suspects that the government in tehran is producing nuclear weapons , but iran has denied these claims . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .
they made plans to resume talks later this week . security council insists on suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana : misunderstandings were cleared up on the weekend and talks would continue director of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei welcomed the talks between the eu and tehran in his opening speech at an iaea conference monday in vienna . " i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .
the un security council suspects that the government in tehran is producing nuclear weapons , but iran has denied these claims . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .

speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .
his book of memoirs entitled " not i " will be published in the coming weeks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the günter grass case : a " thoroughly german " scandal four weeks after günter grass publicly acknowledged that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops at the end of wwii , the debate is still raging over the implications of his confession .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
" every time we met at a party , we 'd go to a corner and talk politics . " controversial moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fest 's book on hitler 's last days was later turned into a movie fest helped nazi official and architect albert speer , who became the only one of hitler 's henchmen to publicly repent for his crimes , when he wrote his autobiography " inside the third reich " -lrb- 1970 -rrb- .
speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .
his book of memoirs entitled " not i " will be published in the coming weeks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the günter grass case : a " thoroughly german " scandal four weeks after günter grass publicly acknowledged that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops at the end of wwii , the debate is still raging over the implications of his confession .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .
they made plans to resume talks later this week . security council insists on suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana : misunderstandings were cleared up on the weekend and talks would continue director of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei welcomed the talks between the eu and tehran in his opening speech at an iaea conference monday in vienna . " i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .
the un security council suspects that the government in tehran is producing nuclear weapons , but iran has denied these claims . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .
they made plans to resume talks later this week . security council insists on suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana : misunderstandings were cleared up on the weekend and talks would continue director of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei welcomed the talks between the eu and tehran in his opening speech at an iaea conference monday in vienna . " i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .
the un security council suspects that the government in tehran is producing nuclear weapons , but iran has denied these claims . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .

it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .
they made plans to resume talks later this week . security council insists on suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana : misunderstandings were cleared up on the weekend and talks would continue director of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei welcomed the talks between the eu and tehran in his opening speech at an iaea conference monday in vienna . " i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .
the un security council suspects that the government in tehran is producing nuclear weapons , but iran has denied these claims . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2006 does legalizing immigrants attract even more ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seldom in spain for a visa , just for work the wave of african immigrants landing on the canary islands continues .
conservative politicians blame spanish pm zapatero 's immigration laws for attracting even more .
but is their criticism founded ? the pictures on european television screens portray a drama that the continent has seldom seen before .
pictures of african refugees , bodies emaciated with tired , bloodshot eyes , wrapped in blankets being helped on shore by spanish police and security forces .
the message the images intend to send : whoever risks this voyage , risks his life . but what continental europeans are led , or want , to believe , is distorted according to the author of the article " venir en europe : mode d 'emploi " on the internet site www.senegalaisement.com.
the writer says that chances of dying on the trip to the canaries are next to zero , as long as the " security measures " are respected . how to reach europe on the cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of boats like these have reached the canaries in 2006 the journeys to the spanish islands located off the northwest african coast on boats that hardly look seaworthy are according to the author " a good solution for senegalese men , " particularly for young men .
all the details about how to reach europe , including a price list can be found on the web site . a place on a boat with a " good motor " costs around 4,500 euros -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- per person .
the traveler has to add a bit more for " safety equipment , " gasoline and food .
but once the difficult journey is completed , the most " open country in the world " awaits , according to senegalaisement.com.
the reader finds out that the life of a refugee in spain is comfortable and that the iberian country " holds the world record for legalizing immigrants . " eu openly critical such outspoken words from immigrants reaffirm the beliefs of spain 's conservatives that socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has opened the flood gates for waves of uncontrolled immigration to the country .
the opposition is particularly critical of zapatero 's decision last year to grant illegal immigrants legal status .
it is a decision that in their eyes attracted even more africans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero has taken much flak for his policy even the normally staid eu commission took a shot at madrid 's new policy .
eu interior and justice commissioner franco frattini accused zapatero 's legalization policy of drawing illegal immigrants to spain . alone in this year , 20,000 have landed on the coast of the canaries , four times that from 2005 .
zapatero has tried to stem the tide .
in a radio interview , he said spain " would n't accept clandestine or illegal immigration . "
only the help of the eu and more decisive actions from african countries would throttle the flow of immigrants .
nevertheless , the spanish leader said his country needs foreign workers - but only ones who travel with proper papers .
illegal immigration is deceit and a violation to a peaceful coexistence of all people in spain . ngos : no magnet for immigrants zapatero can depend on support from most refugee organizations for his policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of an immigrant 's journey or start of a new life ?
" it is n't a magnet .
the people are n't coming for work papers , they are just coming for work , " said juan miralles of the refugee agency andaluica acoge .
" that is purely a political argument .
that is also wrong . " " you ca n't say that more immigrants are coming .
it 's just that most are choosing to make their way over the atlantic to the canary islands .
the classic routes over -lrb- the exclaves -rrb- ceuta and melilla , or across the straits of gibralter have become practically impassable because they are being patrolled more tightly . " last chance to spain or better chances at home not only has the route to spain changed , but also the timing .
despite possibly being granted legal status , there is a fear among africans they may never have the chance to make it to continental europe . " most think : ' if i do n't flee now , then there wo n't be another chance .
tomorrow might be too late if the eu tightens its policies , " said jose palazon from the organization prodein .
african refugees know that once on spanish territory , there is little chance of them being repatriated since spain has no extradition agreements with most african countries . immigrants from africa in spain say that the only way to stop the flow is to make life better for potential refugees in their own country . " europe should n't send us any money that will then be wasted by politicians .
instead , they should help create jobs for young people , " said andre menda from a club of senegalese immigrants in the province of roquetas . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa .
-lrb- aug .
31 , 2006 -rrb- spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

" there 'll be a happy ending for spain , for europe , for the energy sector and the electricity industry , " zapatero had told the weekly die zeit in an interview . " there will be a solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .

the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .

tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .

last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .

fest was considered germany 's foremost historian on the third reich . joachim fest , one of germany 's most influential historians , passed away on monday at the age of 79 , german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on tuesday . he published the biography " hitler " in 1973 , and his version of the nazi dictator 's end " inside hitler 's bunker : the last days of the third reich " in 2002 .
the latter formed the basis for the oscar-winning film " the downfall , " which was criticised by many for purporting to show the human side of the nazi leader . a conservative polemicist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim fest was germany 's most prominent hitler biographer fest was born in berlin on december 8 , 1926 to a middle class family who did not support the nazis .
his father forbade him to join the hitler youth but he was later drafted into the wehrmacht . he studied law , history , sociology , german and art history at freiburg , frankfurt and berlin .
after his studies , he worked as a journalist , mainly for the right-leaning frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and regularly clashed with left-wing intellectuals about the nazi era . " very few people were so much fun to fight with as ulrike meinhoff , " said joachim fest about a german radical left activist who in the 1970s became a terrorist for the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .

speer had been sentenced to 20 years in prison at the nuremberg trials for his role in the nazi regime and was released in 1966 . after speer 's death and a heated controversy about the accuracy of the book , fest penned an analysis of the work titled " speer : the final verdict , " in which he described speer as an " incomplete person , " who , blinded by his ambition , failed to question " the goals he was so feverishly working toward , and stifled all moral doubts , if indeed any arose , in the ethos of pure functioning . " in recent weeks fest 's name appeared in the newspapers often as commentators compared his approach to germany 's past with that of günter grass , the nobel literature laureate and icon of the left who fell from grace last month when he revealed after a six-decade silence that he had served in the notorious nazi elite force , the waffen ss . in an interview with the german news weekly der spiegel , fest accused grass of having dealt " lightly " with his past while posing as a moral authority . " i would n't even want to buy a used car from this man , " fest said . fest was often criticised for holding back moral judgement on his countrymen 's actions during the nazi era .

2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .

" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .

the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .

" i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .

the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

an estimated 250,000 pilgrims carrying vatican flags and folding chairs went to the field for the mass , some arriving monday evening to spend the night singing hymns under clear skies . for tuesday morning 's mass , hundreds of priests and deacons in white robes arrived in a long procession , reciting a litany of prayers .
they lined up in two columns and streamed toward the raised altar as the rest of the crowds filed in . an appeal to faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims went to islinger field on sept .
2 , when the area was blessed " today , when we have learned to recognize the pathologies and life-threatening diseases associated with religion and reason , and the ways that god 's image can be destroyed by hatred and fanaticism , it is important to state clearly the god in whom we believe , " said the pope , as reported by afp . " only this can free us from being afraid of god - which is ultimately at the root of modern atheism .
only this god saves us from being afraid of the world and from anxiety before the emptiness of life , " the pope said . after the sermon , a young man charged toward the altar where the pope was sitting , but he was stopped by plain-clothes police officers .
officials said the pontiff was not in danger . " it was not a serious disruption to security .
it was apparently a young fan who , in his excitement , wanted to reach the altar , " said hans schaidinger , mayor of regensburg . ecumenical service in regensburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was a magnet for monday 's crowds in altötting , southern germany later on tuesday , the fourth day of the pontiff 's nostalgic tour of the southern german region where he was born and grew up , benedict delivered a lengthy theological speech to staff and students at the university of regensburg , where he was a professor of theology and vice-president from 1969 to 1977 .
" it is a moving experience for me to stand and give a lecture at this university podium once again , " he said .
at 32 minutes , the address was the longest of his six-day visit , which ends thursday .
reiterating his concerns about a modern world " deaf " to god , he warned that other religious cultures like islam saw the west 's exclusion of god " as an attack on their most profound convictions . " " a reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures , " he said . the pope will round off his visit to the city by holding an ecumenical prayer service in regenburg 's cathedral . during his stay in bavaria , pope benedict xvi has visited munich , where he served as archbishop from 1977 to 1982 as cardinal joseph ratzinger , and his birthplace , markt am inn .
during sunday 's mass in munich , the catholic leader warned modern societies of putting too much faith into science and technology , saying it made people " deaf " to god 's message . he also mildly criticized the church in his native germany for neglecting evangelism in favor of aid and social service projects . praise and critique the pope has reaped both praise and criticism during his visit .
the green party has criticized him for his limited view on freedom of expression . claudia roth , head of the green party , said monday evening : " it is unacceptable when pope benedict xvi wants to exclude criticism of religion from freedom of expression , " she said .
this contradicts the notion of a pluralistic , modern and open society , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff has avoided social and political issues during his visit lale akgün , the social democrats ' expert on islamic issues , has demanded more tolerance from the pope toward alternative lifestyles . while she has praised the pontiff for encouraging better integration of muslim citizens into society , she said the catholic church could be more tolerant toward homosexuals , and complained of the church 's attitude toward abortion and contraception . " i would be quite pleased if the pope could be just as tolerant and understanding of the diversity of human life by being more accepting of gays and lesbians and same-sex marriages , " she said . even from his own ranks , the pope has attracted criticism .
matthias weisner , spokesman for the catholic reform movement " wir sind kirche " -lrb- we 're the church -rrb- said on monday , " the vatican 's rigid sexual morals prevents many people from living out their catholic faith within the church . " weisner added that women should gain better access to leadership positions within the roman catholic church . this is pope benedict xvi 's second trip to his native germany - after a visit to world youth day in cologne last august - since his election as pontiff in april 2005 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the pope in bavaria read deutsche welle 's dossier on the pope 's visit .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

conservative politicians blame spanish pm zapatero 's immigration laws for attracting even more .
but is their criticism founded ? the pictures on european television screens portray a drama that the continent has seldom seen before .
pictures of african refugees , bodies emaciated with tired , bloodshot eyes , wrapped in blankets being helped on shore by spanish police and security forces .
the message the images intend to send : whoever risks this voyage , risks his life . but what continental europeans are led , or want , to believe , is distorted according to the author of the article " venir en europe : mode d 'emploi " on the internet site www.senegalaisement.com.
the writer says that chances of dying on the trip to the canaries are next to zero , as long as the " security measures " are respected . how to reach europe on the cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of boats like these have reached the canaries in 2006 the journeys to the spanish islands located off the northwest african coast on boats that hardly look seaworthy are according to the author " a good solution for senegalese men , " particularly for young men .
all the details about how to reach europe , including a price list can be found on the web site . a place on a boat with a " good motor " costs around 4,500 euros -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- per person .
the traveler has to add a bit more for " safety equipment , " gasoline and food .
but once the difficult journey is completed , the most " open country in the world " awaits , according to senegalaisement.com.
the reader finds out that the life of a refugee in spain is comfortable and that the iberian country " holds the world record for legalizing immigrants . " eu openly critical such outspoken words from immigrants reaffirm the beliefs of spain 's conservatives that socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has opened the flood gates for waves of uncontrolled immigration to the country .
the opposition is particularly critical of zapatero 's decision last year to grant illegal immigrants legal status .
it is a decision that in their eyes attracted even more africans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero has taken much flak for his policy even the normally staid eu commission took a shot at madrid 's new policy .
eu interior and justice commissioner franco frattini accused zapatero 's legalization policy of drawing illegal immigrants to spain . alone in this year , 20,000 have landed on the coast of the canaries , four times that from 2005 .
zapatero has tried to stem the tide .
in a radio interview , he said spain " would n't accept clandestine or illegal immigration . "
only the help of the eu and more decisive actions from african countries would throttle the flow of immigrants .
nevertheless , the spanish leader said his country needs foreign workers - but only ones who travel with proper papers .
illegal immigration is deceit and a violation to a peaceful coexistence of all people in spain . ngos : no magnet for immigrants zapatero can depend on support from most refugee organizations for his policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of an immigrant 's journey or start of a new life ?
" it is n't a magnet .
the people are n't coming for work papers , they are just coming for work , " said juan miralles of the refugee agency andaluica acoge .
" that is purely a political argument .
that is also wrong . " " you ca n't say that more immigrants are coming .
it 's just that most are choosing to make their way over the atlantic to the canary islands .
the classic routes over -lrb- the exclaves -rrb- ceuta and melilla , or across the straits of gibralter have become practically impassable because they are being patrolled more tightly . " last chance to spain or better chances at home not only has the route to spain changed , but also the timing .
despite possibly being granted legal status , there is a fear among africans they may never have the chance to make it to continental europe . " most think : ' if i do n't flee now , then there wo n't be another chance .
tomorrow might be too late if the eu tightens its policies , " said jose palazon from the organization prodein .
african refugees know that once on spanish territory , there is little chance of them being repatriated since spain has no extradition agreements with most african countries . immigrants from africa in spain say that the only way to stop the flow is to make life better for potential refugees in their own country . " europe should n't send us any money that will then be wasted by politicians .
instead , they should help create jobs for young people , " said andre menda from a club of senegalese immigrants in the province of roquetas . steffen leidel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa .

while some wo n't budge on demands for sanctions , iran just might give an inch . iran would consider suspending its uranium enrichment program for two months if a series of conditions are met by the major un security council nations , eu diplomats told reporters after weekend talks in vienna between ali larijani , iran 's chief negotiator , and european union secretary general javier solana . conditions include an abdication of penalty measures by the security council and iran 's continued right to maintain a fuel cycle on its territory , reported afp .
in turn , iran would put a temporary halt on uranium enrichment . both larijani and solana said progress was made during their discussions concerning iran 's disputed uranium enrichment program .

" i am encouraged by the dialogue between the eu and other partners to establish conditions for renewed negotiations .
i still believe that negotiations are the best way to find a lasting solution , " he said monday in vienna . the un security council has insisted that iran halt its uranium enrichment program before talks on an international incentive package begin , or else it may impose sanctions . the us and england are staunchly against starting negotiations prior to a suspension , but russia , china , france and possibly germany may be willing to compromise on this , said eu diplomats . us foreign minister condoleezza rice told reporters monday , " if there is a suspension we can have a discussion , but there has to be a suspension . " iran rejected both offer and ultimatum the five un security council veto powers and germany had offered iran in june economic and technical cooperation including the delivery of nuclear technology if they put a stop on their uranium enrichment program .
tehran rejected the offer . iran also did not meet the un security council 's aug .
31 ultimatum for the suspension of uranium enrichment .
last weekend 's talks between solana and larijani were considered a last ditch effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution . depending on the degree to which it is enriched , uranium can be used in nuclear power plants or for building nuclear weapons .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

" both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .

the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .

chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

" both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .

those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .

the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

he and merkel reaffirmed their friendship over the weekend - but how long will the peace last ? on the sidelines of the recently-concluded eu-asia summit in helsinki , german chancellor angela merkel met with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski after a series of irritations in the neighborly relationship threatened to erupt into a full-blown row last week . the league of polish families , coalition partner in the right-wing government led by prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , was planning to curtail the rights of the german minority in poland by stripping them of an electoral privilege , according to reports in the german media . rights for german minority in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- l -rrb- appointed his twin jaroslaw prime minister the issue was the focus of sunday 's half-hour talks .
chancellor angela merkel said after the meeting that she had " received assurances from the polish government that there are no plans to change the principles governing german minority rights in poland . " germany and poland signed a bilateral treaty in 1991 , which stipulated that the 300,000 ethnic germans living in poland are exempt from a rule requiring parties to secure at least 5 percent of a vote to gain representation in the national parliament . " it 's true that we guaranteed minority rights in our discussion , even though the polish minority does n't have these rights elsewhere , " said kaczynski , who added that a lot had been achieved during the meeting with merkel . prior to the helsinki meeting , the polish prime minister had said he was against the asymmetrical rights situation , since the polish minority in germany does n't enjoy any special rights in the german parliament . relations shaky this summer merkel seemed confident after sunday 's meeting that minority rights would be upheld and said she thought both countries knew " how important positive relations are and will act accordingly . " the controversy over the german minority 's rights in poland is the latest in a string of recent issues that have strained relations between germany and poland - a friendship already deeply scarred by the nazi invasion and occupation of poland during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass ' confession of having served in the nazi waffen ss was more fodder in the fire in july , leftist berlin newspaper tageszeitung printed a satire in which polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother , was depicted as a potato .
the incident sparked a furious response by the polish government . for weeks , the polish government has publicly criticized an exhibition in berlin documenting the mass displacement of ethnic germans from eastern european countries , including poland , after the war .
he claimed the exhibition obscured the nazi ’ s role in the tragedy and fostered revisionist tendencies . the polish government has also likened a project for a russian-german gas pipeline under the baltic sea to the hitler-stalin pact signed by nazi germany and the soviet union in 1939 , which defined the two countries ' spheres of hegemonial influence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said reently that germany 's ties with poland have become unsteady and the neighbours need to work on promoting mutual understanding . " there are a few irritations in the neighbourly relationship between germany and poland , " steinmeier told german rbb local radio . steinmeier said he had discussed the need to create " a bridge of understanding " with polish counterpart anna fotyga . kaczynski to visit berlin merkel too underlined the importance of mainting good ties with warsaw . " it was clear that we need good neighborly relations and there are problems that we do n't want to sweep under the rug , " the chancellor said after her meeting with kaczynski . she and the prime minister will have another opportunity to discuss each delicate point more thoroughly when kaczynski comes to berlin on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.09.2006 eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are n't known for their voter-friendly tactics a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections . reacting to a recent neo-nazi attack on the activists of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin , vice-president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse on tuesday accused the berlin police of being too lenient . " both right-wing thugs , who brutally beat up a member of young social democrats -lrb- jusos -rrb- on sunday evening , were at first dismissed by the police , " thierse told daily leipziger volkszeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse believes the police should act more decisevely " only under pressure from above did the police feel obliged to arrest them .
that is an alarming event , which shows that the police are still not acting unambiguously and decisively enough . " according to thierse , who is himself a member of spd , german neo-nazis have been emboldened by the 2003 decision of the federal constitutional court not to ban the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . " i have a feeling that the effects of the failure to ban npd are actually becoming visible only today , " thierse said .
" the right extremists ' increasingly aggressive self-confidence has something to do with the fact that they feel directly protected by the constitutional court .
we should not let this state of affairs persist for ever . " spd 's coallition partners from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , see the situation differently .
president of the cdu parliamentary group in the bundestag wolfgang bosbach , for example , opposed the idea of banning npd . " a second attempt to ban npd would have no chance , " bosbach said .
" and the state should spare itself a second embarrassment . " " i have no doubt that the office for the protection of the constitution and the police are acting with necessary determination against right-wing activities , " bosbach said . election fever as elections on september 17 in the states of berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania near and as campaigning activities are intensifying , right-wing youths associated with the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have been using increasingly aggressive tactics . on sunday , two 23-year-olds pasting election posters for the social democrats in the eastern berlin district of marzahn were victims to an attack by two young neo-nazis .
one of the campaign helpers ended up in hospital after being repeatedly kicked in the head once he was knocked to the ground .
the other election helper managed to escape . that violent incident is just one example of what many politicians have criticized in this recent election campaign , namely physical intimidation and violence by right-wing , mainly young , extremists . democratic parties face intimidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis do n't enjoy wide , just enough , support in germany the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in both berlin and mecklenburg-west pomerania is attempting to garner enough votes to clear the five percent hurdle needed to be represented in those state legislatures .
in berlin , the far-right party and its adherents are depending more on brute force to get their message across . information booths of parties from across the political spectrum have literally been laid siege to and surrounded by right-wing extremists in berlin according to social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- general secretary hubertus heil .
those passers-by who nevertheless braved the menacing scene around the booths to get party brochures , have been filmed , photographed , intimidated and threatened , heil said . the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin also complained that " constant attacks from extremist and more frequently right-wing extremist groups on the information booths of democratic parties " have become an unacceptable distraction . on saturday , berlin police arrested a 20-year old man who had participated in an attack in august on an information booth of the left party / party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- .
they charged him with violating weapons ' laws and attempted aggravated assault . meck-pom npd trying different tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no npd posters outside meck-pom 's capital schwerin while few expect the npd to garner enough votes in berlin to get into parliament , the situation in mecklenburg-west pomerania is another matter . known by many germans as meck-pom , the state 's npd party is confident of gaining seats in the state legislature .
the npd is already represented in the state parliaments of the states of saxony and brandenburg . current opinion polls place the npd at seven percent , two points clear of the mandatory five percent to make the parliament . on the town squares of cities in the northeastern state , one of the country 's poorest and with the highest rate of unemployment at 18.9 percent , npd members have shed their standard black bomber jackets and high-laced boots for suits and ties .
instead of fisticuffs , they are exchanging verbal blows . the country 's national politicians have reacted to the possibility of the right-wingers entering a third eastern state parliament .
chancellor angela merkel and spd chair kurt beck have traveled to mecklenburg-western pomerania to implore voters to go to the polls and stop the npd . yet the chances look slim currently .
the npd has pumped over 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- into the election campaign in the northeast , forcing even left party leader gregor gysi to remark sarcastically : " you 're happy if you see a poster of the cdu among all those of the npd .

one of them is berlin . sunday saw the opening of the 2006 architecture biennale , and many are saying it 's more about sociology than urban planning .
entitled " cities , architecture and society , " it looks at the changing face of today 's urban environments and showcases work from fifty countries .
" one of the biggest global problems of today and in the years to come is that of urban progress and population growth , " said davide croff , chairman of the venice biennale .
" in 2005 , for the first time , the number of the planet 's inhabitants living in cities surpassed 50 percent . " " the city is the main place where architecture is practiced , and it 's also the place where one measures the ability to live together , where one measures the strong links which exist between architecture and society , " he said . " we needed to go and look and see what has happened in the big cities , understand their effects on man and on his quality of life , to give a world view of big cities , " said british architect richard burdett , director of the festival . " it 's also interesting that this mostra on the cities in expansion is taking place in venice , a city in decline , " he added . berlin : illustrative of 20th century change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects from all over the world have left their mark on berlin one city decidedly not in decline is the german capital .
" berlin is exemplary of developments in 20th century europe , " said burdett . the exhibition " convertible city " curated by armand grüntuch and almut ernst in the german pavilion was opened on sunday by transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , who took the opportunity to call for sustainable urban development to counter problems such as sprawl and pollution besetting cities from bogota to bombay . against a backdrop of shrinking cities and population decline , grüntuch has turned his back on ambitious new building and champions instead a new approach to using existing material and reclaiming space rather than building from scratch . a playground for international architects over the last 16 years , many of the more ambitious projects designed to revamp the once-divided city of berlin have fallen disappointingly flat . today , it 's a place where urban planners have learnt to maximize latent potential and simultaneously adapt to surroundings - and grüntuch is convinced this is the way of the future . " coming to grips with existing structures in the city will come increasingly to the fore , " said grüntuch , who believes - like many architects - that cities are already big enough .
" it 's a matter of finding up-to-date solutions that reflect our present-day attitudes . " non-invasive the show 's 36 projects reflect his priorities , exploring living concepts customized to meet contemporary needs in what can be called a " non-invasive " fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' badeschiff ' : a welcome addition to the city one of them is berlin 's landmark " badeschiff , " or swimming ship .
the pool anchored in the river spree was originally conceived as an art project about urban regeneration , but fast become a fashionable haunt for aspiring beach bums in the land-locked capital .
it 's proven so popular that in winter it will be given a plastic roof to ensure uninterrupted bathing for the berlin public . another entry is called " rooftop football , " a red carpet on the roof of the historic building in which the pavilion is housed .
it 's equally illustrative of the curators ' principles , combining the modern idea of the garden on the roof with the concept of conversion and new uses for old structures . " instead of tearing down buildings we do n't like or do n't need anymore , conversion provides a way out of the throwaway mentality , " said almut ernst . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the struggle to shape the heart of berlin a proposal to build a temporary art museum on berlin 's palace square has reignited the heated debate about the space 's future : should the old imperial palace be reconstructed or should future generations get to decide ?

but now , it seems , more and more of us are opting to fulfil our dreams on the internet .
you may not believe it , but the picture to the right is of breakfast 's julia george .
at least it 's a computer generated image of julia as she appears in the online world of second life .
it 's a virtual world where you can build property , buy and sell things and even change the appearance of your alter ego .
it 's just one example of how technology , and in particular the worldwide web are changing , and it 's the theme for our first of three reports as we ask : " where for the web ? "

but are the music industry 's marketing men muscling in on the technology ?
we talked to the lead singer of the band shimura curves , which has four tracks on the website myspace .
from the website , they 've built up a small but loyal fan base , who can be e-mailed about forthcoming gigs .

the rural payments agency , already under fire for delays in payouts , said it would review one-fifth of them amid fears they may have been wrong .
while many farmers could get top-ups , others are facing paying money back .
the agency is responsible for allocating about £ 1.5bn under the eu 's single farm payment scheme .
martin haworth , director of policy for the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- , said : " we know terrible mistakes have been made and that a lot of the payments will have to be reviewed .
" in many cases that is because a farmer has not received what was expected and has raised a query .
" sadly this means the rural payments agency is still unravelling last year 's mess when it should be concentrating on getting this year 's system right .
" there is therefore a very high risk of yet more delay and confusion - which is why the nfu is pressing defra to announce a substantial part payment of the 2006 entitlements in december . "
the rural payments agency said the payment review was a housekeeping exercise and the priority was always to get the money out as quickly as possible .
consistent problems since its introduction last year , the payment scheme has been dogged by problems .
the government promised the bulk of the money would be paid by february , but most farmers were left waiting until the end of june .
there were computer problems and in april the government agreed to make partial payments to help farmers facing financial problems .
at the end of august , the agency announced it had paid out almost 98 % of the fund to a total of 111,829 claimants .

more than 6,000 prisoners pass through ni 's jails every year , and their needs are to be discussed at a healthy prisons conference in lisburn .
director of the northern ireland prison service robin masefield said healthcare in jail was not just a prisons issue .
he said the health and criminal justice sectors should cooperate more .
" people with mental health disorders should be cared for in the most appropriate location - not the most convenient one , " he said .
statistics from england and wales indicate that nine out of 10 prisoners have a diagnosable mental health problem , substance misuse problem , or both , while four out of five prisoners smoke , compared to one in four of the general population .
the promoting healthy prisons conference has been organised by the health promotion agency for northern ireland -lrb- hpa -rrb- and the northern ireland prison service .
the event aims to raise awareness of health and personal development issues regarding inmates .
dr brian gaffney , chief executive of the hpa , said the attention needed to be on the whole prison community .
" the factors that make someone more likely to re-offend , for instance , lack of education or employment , substance misuse , poor housing , and weak social and family links , are the same factors that contribute to poor health , " he said .
" the healthy prison approach provides a valuable opportunity to improve prisoners ' levels of learning and self-esteem , which can increase their capacity to reach their full potential when released , and as a result , reduce the likelihood of re-offending . "

the bridge , one of only eight in the world , was opened on 12 september , 1906 by viscount tredegar .
it was built to cope with rapid development on the east side of the river and to take workers to the lysaghts steelworks in particular .
campaigners hope the grade i-listed structure will eventually be made a world heritage site .

" part of the bargain with the town council was that he asked for a bridge near to the area where most of his workers would be living . "
a bridge to nowhere ?
' not for long ' she said the structure , one of the highest and longest transporter bridges in the world , was built to cope with the river 's high tidal reach and so ships with tall masts could pass underneath .
" it 's definitely iconic - it 's the icon of newport and of wales really .
the whole of the welsh nation should be proud of it , " she said .
" let 's hope it goes for another 100 years . "
richard parnaby , professor of architecture at the university of the west of england , bristol , said the bridge was an " eccentric and wonderful " structure .

the state news agency xinhua recently announced that foreign media must now seek its approval before distributing any news and pictures within china .
joel simon , from the committee to protect journalists , described the new rules as " a step backwards " .
reporters without borders said the changes could have a " serious impact " on the work of foreign news agencies .
correspondents say it is unclear what changes the new rules will lead to on the ground .
china already heavily censors material for its domestic audience , and foreign media companies have long been barred from selling news services directly to chinese outlets .
business news wires which sell information directly to chinese customers are likely to be among the worst affected .
" we are studying these rules closely to see how they differ from the current guidelines , and will be discussing the details of the new regulation with xinhua , " a reuters spokesperson told the bbc .
the new regulations come amid an apparent clampdown on the media in china .
a researcher for the new york times was recently jailed for three years for fraud , and a correspondent for singapore 's straits times was also sentenced to five years for spying .
' predator ' the new regulations give xinhua the power to censor reports from foreign agencies that are deemed to be a danger to national unity or social stability .
in a statement issued late on monday , reporters without borders accused xinhua of becoming a " predator of both free enterprise and freedom of information " .
sharon hom , executive director of human rights in china , said the rules also go against beijing 's promise to let reporters freely cover the 2008 beijing olympics .
" these latest measures sound a wake-up call to the international community that a closed , state-controlled olympics is on the horizon , " she told the associated press .
european commission president jose manuel barroso also criticised the regulations , saying that any restriction on press freedom was " a very negative development " .

the president talked of " a struggle for civilisation " and said the safety of the nation depended on the outcome of " the battle in the streets of baghdad " .
the middle east , he said , faced " terrorist states and radical dictators armed with nuclear weapons " .
us democrats accused mr bush of playing politics ahead of november elections . "

in a prime-time television address from the oval office , president bush said the " war on terror " was much more than a military conflict .
" it is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century and the calling of our generation , " he said .
" it is a struggle for civilisation .
we are fighting to maintain a way of life enjoyed by free nations . "

" we must put aside our differences and work together to meet the test that history has given us , " mr bush said .
he praised the heroes of 11 september , while for osama bin laden , al-qaeda 's fugitive leader , there was a pledge to bring him " and other terrorists ... to justice " .
attacks in detail how the towers fell however , as our correspondent notes , the speech also had the aim of shoring up mr bush 's republican party before the mid-term congressional elections .
to help with that , he needed to convince a largely sceptical nation that the war in iraq was part of the war on al-qaeda .
" i 'm often asked why we are in iraq when saddam hussein was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
the regime of saddam hussein was a clear threat ... and after 9/11 saddam 's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take , " mr bush said .

" the president should be ashamed of using a national day of mourning ... to seek support for a war in iraq that he has admitted had ' nothing ' to do with 9/11 , " he said .
al-qaeda , the militant network held responsible for the 11 september attacks , has issued a new threat of attacks which it said would target gulf states and israel in particular .
in a video released on the eve of the anniversary , ayman al-zawahiri , al-qaeda 's second-in-command , said western forces were doomed to defeat in iraq and afghanistan .

primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- , which control local nhs budgets , responded by drawing up a number of plans involving health trainers , school nurses , dieticians and health psychologists .
some £ 211m of extra funding to pay for the projects was due to kick in this year , with another £ 131m next .
but the association of directors of public health says the money is not reaching the public health budgets because it is being used to plug deficits instead .
