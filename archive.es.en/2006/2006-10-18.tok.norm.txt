german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .
unlike last season , no one looks likely to run away with the title - which should make things more exciting for the majority of bundesliga fans . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise nuremberg drew with bielefeld on sunday , and dortmund picked up a win in cottbus .

her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin .

i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .

i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .

" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .

" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way .

i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .

i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .

the second reactor was closed down this week after routine inspections . an unknown number of falsely installed screw anchors could keep the biblis nuclear power plant offline for some time . " we 'll get block b operating again only when we 're sure that everything is okay , " said a spokesman for the plant . essen-based rwe , the operator of the plant , said that around 4,000 special screw anchors would require closer inspection before the plant would be up and running again .
the screw anchors are used to fasten down pipelines in both block a and block b of the plant to make them " earthquake-safe . " block b was closed on monday after the falsely installed screw anchors were discovered in block a. hesse 's environment ministry then decided that all the anchors in both blocks should be examined , which is not possible when the plant is in operation .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .

locals still remember her as a hippie with a cause . michelle bachelet and her mother arrived in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- in 1975 , after both were detained and tortured by the regime of augusto pinochet .
her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse . " her mother was bourgeois , she could not understand that we had to line up outside of shops , " she said . socialist agreement the bachelets were invited to the gdr under an agreement between the east german authorities and the socialist party of chile , which bachelet had joined as a student in santiago . she recently told the german weekly newspaper die zeit that she has fond memories of her four years behind the iron curtain , recalling that it is where she married her now estranged husband , fellow chilean exile jorge davalos , in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet celebrating her presidential victory with her family " whether the readers like to hear this or not , the time i spent in potsdam and leipzig was a very happy part of my life , " she said .
" i was 23 years old when i came here .
i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet had something to celebrate after winning the election this year " in a way , she cut her teeth here .
i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks . " president barroso has clarified that indeed there is no element that suggests that any rule has not been respected - so the rules have been observed , " said the commissioner 's spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commissioner criticizes " arrogant " brussels officials eu industry commissioner günter verheugen told a german newspaper that his job is a constant bureaucratic power struggle .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats .

over 1,000 people have fallen ill from contamination since then ; at least 10 have died .
now , the waste is heading back to europe . henri petigan is the man doing the dirty work in abidjan , the former capital of ivory coast .
for weeks now , he has been transporting tons of contaminated soil , rocks and mud in the city .
most of the material is in closed containers .
now the next stage is on the agenda : " we 're preparing the toxic waste for transportation by sea back to europe , " petigan said via satellite phone . that sounds easier than it is . analyses have to be conducted to determine what kind of hazardous waste it is exactly and to which european countries the various types of waste can be sent . ivorian-based french waste management company tredi has commissioned petigan with the task .
ivorian officials have requested that he get the environmental catastrophe under control , but that requires time . the 500 tons of toxic waste will not be transported back to europe for another three to four weeks . but a much greater problem remains . tons more toxic waste than before bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says toxic sludge was dumped at 17 different sites around abidjan " we 're only talking about the 500 tons of waste that was deposited here and is to be sent back , " said petigan .
" but the whole area in abidjan - soil , water , concrete - was contaminated .
that has to be transported out of here too , and there are several thousand tons of that , " he added . in other words , europe will be getting back a lot more of the toxic waste than it shipped off to the third world in the first place .
no one knows yet where the toxic waste can be processed and deposited . the european union has around 30 special depositories for toxic waste - primarily in countries that had nothing to do with the scandal , such as france , germany and belgium . black market mess the french government , out of a sense of obligation as the former colonial power of the ivory coast , said it was willing to dispose of the waste in special depositories in france . that , however , does not change matters when it comes to political responsibilities . " probo koala " was the name of the greek ship that transported the toxic waste .
it left port in amsterdam uncontested , though dutch authorities should have stopped it , since the eu bans the export of hazardous waste . barbara helfferich , a spokeswoman for the european commission , is quite clear on the matter .
" the political responsibility lays with the eu member states , in this case , with the netherlands , " she said . " the problem is , we 're dealing with a huge black market here , and it is difficult to take action against the culprits , " she added . the scandal reflects only the tip of the iceberg , helfferich said , and pointed to random tests done at various european ports : half of the waste to be transported - which was declared " non-toxic " - turned out to be toxic after all . always on the go those who try to kick up even more dirt stumble across an obscure web of economic interests and company involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas - in front of the probo koala tanker - now has his hands full the probo koala toxic waste freighter is a greek ship that flies under a panamanian flag , but which is commissioned by international raw materials corporation trafigura , which has its headquarters in lucerne , switzerland . according to news reports , trafigura has turnover of nearly $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- a year and 55 offices in 36 different countries on several different continents . the corporation 's lawyers are on the road a lot these days .
a couple of months ago , they were in the united states , where trafigura was fined $ 20 million for illegal oil exports out of iraq . trafigura appears to be a specialist in risky business deals in raw materials .
in a statement , the company claimed to have not sent toxic waste to the ivory coast .
it said that the cargo was harmless and must have been contaminated by a local transportation company . trafigura , however , has offered to send its attorneys to the ivory coast . martin durm -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for g8 partnerships with africa german chancellor angela merkel plans to use berlin 's g8 presidency to make the group of most industrialized nations and russia take an active role in development projects in africa , according to press reports .

locals still remember her as a hippie with a cause . michelle bachelet and her mother arrived in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- in 1975 , after both were detained and tortured by the regime of augusto pinochet .
her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse . " her mother was bourgeois , she could not understand that we had to line up outside of shops , " she said . socialist agreement the bachelets were invited to the gdr under an agreement between the east german authorities and the socialist party of chile , which bachelet had joined as a student in santiago . she recently told the german weekly newspaper die zeit that she has fond memories of her four years behind the iron curtain , recalling that it is where she married her now estranged husband , fellow chilean exile jorge davalos , in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet celebrating her presidential victory with her family " whether the readers like to hear this or not , the time i spent in potsdam and leipzig was a very happy part of my life , " she said .
" i was 23 years old when i came here .
i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet had something to celebrate after winning the election this year " in a way , she cut her teeth here .
i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .
unlike last season , no one looks likely to run away with the title - which should make things more exciting for the majority of bundesliga fans . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise nuremberg drew with bielefeld on sunday , and dortmund picked up a win in cottbus .

a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .

" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .

according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .

a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .
like most of his clients and employees , he speaks fluent german as well as turkish .
still , he produces tv commercials in turkish that are aimed at second-generation , german-speaking turks . " wherever it makes sense to be bilingual , we 'll be bilingual , " calmaz said .
" i 've lived here for years and feel comfortable here , but i was born in turkey .
i 'm from there and i want to be seen in that way .
and many people feel the same way .
although they speak german well and have many german friends , they want to be perceived as turks in germany .

" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .

locals still remember her as a hippie with a cause . michelle bachelet and her mother arrived in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- in 1975 , after both were detained and tortured by the regime of augusto pinochet .
her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse . " her mother was bourgeois , she could not understand that we had to line up outside of shops , " she said . socialist agreement the bachelets were invited to the gdr under an agreement between the east german authorities and the socialist party of chile , which bachelet had joined as a student in santiago . she recently told the german weekly newspaper die zeit that she has fond memories of her four years behind the iron curtain , recalling that it is where she married her now estranged husband , fellow chilean exile jorge davalos , in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet celebrating her presidential victory with her family " whether the readers like to hear this or not , the time i spent in potsdam and leipzig was a very happy part of my life , " she said .
" i was 23 years old when i came here .
i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet had something to celebrate after winning the election this year " in a way , she cut her teeth here .
i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .
and while it was going up , many of the grim high-rises surrounding it were being torn down , in an effort to revitalize this desolate suburb of eastern berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new facade the ones that remain still look as drab as ever , but the latest innovation foresees revamping 64,000 square meters -lrb- 690,000 square feet -rrb- of six residential blocks along the " hellersdorf promenade " with facades that recreate the look of traditional houses in european cities from amsterdam and warsaw to london and lisbon . according to its organizers , it will be the " biggest mural in the world . " the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .
with community their first priority , locals ' own visions for the neighborhood are always integrated into the final designs . the community spirit does n't stop there .
in hellersdorf , the project is also designed to get out-of-work painters and decorators back in business and to offer young people an opportunity to gain some skills . theme park funding for " europa quarter " has been in place for several months .
austrian property giant level one , which acquired the 100 high-rises , is willing to pour 15 million euros -lrb- $ 18.8 million -rrb- in their renovation - one-third of which will be spent on the facades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin already has no shortage of tourist attractions ceo peter brockhaus sees it as " an investment in the future , " with the new-look neighborhood set to house european-themed specialty stores and eateries , such as tapas bars in madrid , pasta restaurants in milan and smart boutiques in paris . hellersdorf is pinning its hopes on the mini-europe .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .

locals still remember her as a hippie with a cause . michelle bachelet and her mother arrived in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- in 1975 , after both were detained and tortured by the regime of augusto pinochet .
her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse . " her mother was bourgeois , she could not understand that we had to line up outside of shops , " she said . socialist agreement the bachelets were invited to the gdr under an agreement between the east german authorities and the socialist party of chile , which bachelet had joined as a student in santiago . she recently told the german weekly newspaper die zeit that she has fond memories of her four years behind the iron curtain , recalling that it is where she married her now estranged husband , fellow chilean exile jorge davalos , in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet celebrating her presidential victory with her family " whether the readers like to hear this or not , the time i spent in potsdam and leipzig was a very happy part of my life , " she said .
" i was 23 years old when i came here .
i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet had something to celebrate after winning the election this year " in a way , she cut her teeth here .
i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .
unlike last season , no one looks likely to run away with the title - which should make things more exciting for the majority of bundesliga fans . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise nuremberg drew with bielefeld on sunday , and dortmund picked up a win in cottbus .

for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .
it 's in everyone 's interests that ankara and nicosia jump over their shadows if the 32-year-old cyprus conflict is ever going to end . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , cyprus agree on accession talks with turkey the eu overcame last-minute objections from cyprus monday to start detailed membership talks with turkey , narrowly avoiding a new crisis for the beleaguered bloc .

gabriel said the country needed to start applying the brakes on global warming now . be prepared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potsdam institute for climate research created this global-warming chart " we have to prepare now in order not to be mowed down by tomorrow 's economic and social consequences , " gabriel told the conference . hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate research , said a national plan on climate change is long overdue . " if we do n't have strong climate-control policies in place , by the end of the century , temperatures will rise by somewhere between two and five degrees celcius , " he said .
" if it increases more than two degrees celsius , then we are getting into an area that we can no longer control . " in the long term , a warmer climate means sea levels will rise 30 to 50 meters -lrb- 100 to 160 feet -rrb- by the next century .
but climate change will be noticeable long before 2100 , schellnhuber said . " if we take heat waves like that of 2003 as a standard - and by 2040 that will certainly be the case - then life in cities will be changed . " change is underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate education made easy ?
maybe if you learn about it by playing this climate change board game a key goal of the new competency center is to concentrate and disseminate research . " the message is that climate change is not a thing of the future , or even far off , " troge said .
" it is taking place today . " according to troge , temperatures will rise most in the winter .
summer rains are expected to be 30 percent less by 2100 , which could affect crops . " climate change will change our habits and affect a lot of economic areas - tourism , energy , and insurance , especially insurance for natural catastrophes , will be affected , " troge said . because of expected increase in rainfall , flood protection must be increased through dikes and floodwalls , he added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .

" it is taking place today . " according to troge , temperatures will rise most in the winter .
summer rains are expected to be 30 percent less by 2100 , which could affect crops . " climate change will change our habits and affect a lot of economic areas - tourism , energy , and insurance , especially insurance for natural catastrophes , will be affected , " troge said . because of expected increase in rainfall , flood protection must be increased through dikes and floodwalls , he added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .
unlike last season , no one looks likely to run away with the title - which should make things more exciting for the majority of bundesliga fans . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise nuremberg drew with bielefeld on sunday , and dortmund picked up a win in cottbus .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .

markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .
and while it was going up , many of the grim high-rises surrounding it were being torn down , in an effort to revitalize this desolate suburb of eastern berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new facade the ones that remain still look as drab as ever , but the latest innovation foresees revamping 64,000 square meters -lrb- 690,000 square feet -rrb- of six residential blocks along the " hellersdorf promenade " with facades that recreate the look of traditional houses in european cities from amsterdam and warsaw to london and lisbon . according to its organizers , it will be the " biggest mural in the world . " the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .
with community their first priority , locals ' own visions for the neighborhood are always integrated into the final designs . the community spirit does n't stop there .
in hellersdorf , the project is also designed to get out-of-work painters and decorators back in business and to offer young people an opportunity to gain some skills . theme park funding for " europa quarter " has been in place for several months .
austrian property giant level one , which acquired the 100 high-rises , is willing to pour 15 million euros -lrb- $ 18.8 million -rrb- in their renovation - one-third of which will be spent on the facades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin already has no shortage of tourist attractions ceo peter brockhaus sees it as " an investment in the future , " with the new-look neighborhood set to house european-themed specialty stores and eateries , such as tapas bars in madrid , pasta restaurants in milan and smart boutiques in paris . hellersdorf is pinning its hopes on the mini-europe .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks . " president barroso has clarified that indeed there is no element that suggests that any rule has not been respected - so the rules have been observed , " said the commissioner 's spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commissioner criticizes " arrogant " brussels officials eu industry commissioner günter verheugen told a german newspaper that his job is a constant bureaucratic power struggle .

gabriel said the country needed to start applying the brakes on global warming now . be prepared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potsdam institute for climate research created this global-warming chart " we have to prepare now in order not to be mowed down by tomorrow 's economic and social consequences , " gabriel told the conference . hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate research , said a national plan on climate change is long overdue . " if we do n't have strong climate-control policies in place , by the end of the century , temperatures will rise by somewhere between two and five degrees celcius , " he said .
" if it increases more than two degrees celsius , then we are getting into an area that we can no longer control . " in the long term , a warmer climate means sea levels will rise 30 to 50 meters -lrb- 100 to 160 feet -rrb- by the next century .
but climate change will be noticeable long before 2100 , schellnhuber said . " if we take heat waves like that of 2003 as a standard - and by 2040 that will certainly be the case - then life in cities will be changed . " change is underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate education made easy ?

" it is taking place today . " according to troge , temperatures will rise most in the winter .
summer rains are expected to be 30 percent less by 2100 , which could affect crops . " climate change will change our habits and affect a lot of economic areas - tourism , energy , and insurance , especially insurance for natural catastrophes , will be affected , " troge said . because of expected increase in rainfall , flood protection must be increased through dikes and floodwalls , he added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .
it 's in everyone 's interests that ankara and nicosia jump over their shadows if the 32-year-old cyprus conflict is ever going to end . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , cyprus agree on accession talks with turkey the eu overcame last-minute objections from cyprus monday to start detailed membership talks with turkey , narrowly avoiding a new crisis for the beleaguered bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 18.10.2006 " ethno-marketing " helps german firms expand customer base großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany increasingly , german companies are expanding their markets without going overseas .
a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .
like most of his clients and employees , he speaks fluent german as well as turkish .
still , he produces tv commercials in turkish that are aimed at second-generation , german-speaking turks . " wherever it makes sense to be bilingual , we 'll be bilingual , " calmaz said .
" i 've lived here for years and feel comfortable here , but i was born in turkey .
i 'm from there and i want to be seen in that way .
and many people feel the same way .
although they speak german well and have many german friends , they want to be perceived as turks in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.10.2006 opinion : cyprus issue should n't spike turkey eu accession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless both turkey and cyprus jump over their shadows , ankara can forget any further accession talks with the eu , says dw 's berndt riegert . in the stand-off over ankara 's recognition of the greek-cypriot government in nicosia , the eu has appealed to both sides to compromise .
on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .
it 's in everyone 's interests that ankara and nicosia jump over their shadows if the 32-year-old cyprus conflict is ever going to end . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , cyprus agree on accession talks with turkey the eu overcame last-minute objections from cyprus monday to start detailed membership talks with turkey , narrowly avoiding a new crisis for the beleaguered bloc .

over 1,000 people have fallen ill from contamination since then ; at least 10 have died .
now , the waste is heading back to europe . henri petigan is the man doing the dirty work in abidjan , the former capital of ivory coast .
for weeks now , he has been transporting tons of contaminated soil , rocks and mud in the city .
most of the material is in closed containers .
now the next stage is on the agenda : " we 're preparing the toxic waste for transportation by sea back to europe , " petigan said via satellite phone . that sounds easier than it is . analyses have to be conducted to determine what kind of hazardous waste it is exactly and to which european countries the various types of waste can be sent . ivorian-based french waste management company tredi has commissioned petigan with the task .
ivorian officials have requested that he get the environmental catastrophe under control , but that requires time . the 500 tons of toxic waste will not be transported back to europe for another three to four weeks . but a much greater problem remains . tons more toxic waste than before bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says toxic sludge was dumped at 17 different sites around abidjan " we 're only talking about the 500 tons of waste that was deposited here and is to be sent back , " said petigan .
" but the whole area in abidjan - soil , water , concrete - was contaminated .
that has to be transported out of here too , and there are several thousand tons of that , " he added . in other words , europe will be getting back a lot more of the toxic waste than it shipped off to the third world in the first place .
no one knows yet where the toxic waste can be processed and deposited . the european union has around 30 special depositories for toxic waste - primarily in countries that had nothing to do with the scandal , such as france , germany and belgium . black market mess the french government , out of a sense of obligation as the former colonial power of the ivory coast , said it was willing to dispose of the waste in special depositories in france . that , however , does not change matters when it comes to political responsibilities . " probo koala " was the name of the greek ship that transported the toxic waste .
it left port in amsterdam uncontested , though dutch authorities should have stopped it , since the eu bans the export of hazardous waste . barbara helfferich , a spokeswoman for the european commission , is quite clear on the matter .
" the political responsibility lays with the eu member states , in this case , with the netherlands , " she said . " the problem is , we 're dealing with a huge black market here , and it is difficult to take action against the culprits , " she added . the scandal reflects only the tip of the iceberg , helfferich said , and pointed to random tests done at various european ports : half of the waste to be transported - which was declared " non-toxic " - turned out to be toxic after all . always on the go those who try to kick up even more dirt stumble across an obscure web of economic interests and company involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas - in front of the probo koala tanker - now has his hands full the probo koala toxic waste freighter is a greek ship that flies under a panamanian flag , but which is commissioned by international raw materials corporation trafigura , which has its headquarters in lucerne , switzerland . according to news reports , trafigura has turnover of nearly $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- a year and 55 offices in 36 different countries on several different continents . the corporation 's lawyers are on the road a lot these days .
a couple of months ago , they were in the united states , where trafigura was fined $ 20 million for illegal oil exports out of iraq . trafigura appears to be a specialist in risky business deals in raw materials .
in a statement , the company claimed to have not sent toxic waste to the ivory coast .
it said that the cargo was harmless and must have been contaminated by a local transportation company . trafigura , however , has offered to send its attorneys to the ivory coast . martin durm -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for g8 partnerships with africa german chancellor angela merkel plans to use berlin 's g8 presidency to make the group of most industrialized nations and russia take an active role in development projects in africa , according to press reports .

over 1,000 people have fallen ill from contamination since then ; at least 10 have died .
now , the waste is heading back to europe . henri petigan is the man doing the dirty work in abidjan , the former capital of ivory coast .
for weeks now , he has been transporting tons of contaminated soil , rocks and mud in the city .
most of the material is in closed containers .
now the next stage is on the agenda : " we 're preparing the toxic waste for transportation by sea back to europe , " petigan said via satellite phone . that sounds easier than it is . analyses have to be conducted to determine what kind of hazardous waste it is exactly and to which european countries the various types of waste can be sent . ivorian-based french waste management company tredi has commissioned petigan with the task .
ivorian officials have requested that he get the environmental catastrophe under control , but that requires time . the 500 tons of toxic waste will not be transported back to europe for another three to four weeks . but a much greater problem remains . tons more toxic waste than before bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says toxic sludge was dumped at 17 different sites around abidjan " we 're only talking about the 500 tons of waste that was deposited here and is to be sent back , " said petigan .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .
and while it was going up , many of the grim high-rises surrounding it were being torn down , in an effort to revitalize this desolate suburb of eastern berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new facade the ones that remain still look as drab as ever , but the latest innovation foresees revamping 64,000 square meters -lrb- 690,000 square feet -rrb- of six residential blocks along the " hellersdorf promenade " with facades that recreate the look of traditional houses in european cities from amsterdam and warsaw to london and lisbon . according to its organizers , it will be the " biggest mural in the world . " the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .
and while it was going up , many of the grim high-rises surrounding it were being torn down , in an effort to revitalize this desolate suburb of eastern berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new facade the ones that remain still look as drab as ever , but the latest innovation foresees revamping 64,000 square meters -lrb- 690,000 square feet -rrb- of six residential blocks along the " hellersdorf promenade " with facades that recreate the look of traditional houses in european cities from amsterdam and warsaw to london and lisbon . according to its organizers , it will be the " biggest mural in the world . " the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .
with community their first priority , locals ' own visions for the neighborhood are always integrated into the final designs . the community spirit does n't stop there .
in hellersdorf , the project is also designed to get out-of-work painters and decorators back in business and to offer young people an opportunity to gain some skills . theme park funding for " europa quarter " has been in place for several months .
austrian property giant level one , which acquired the 100 high-rises , is willing to pour 15 million euros -lrb- $ 18.8 million -rrb- in their renovation - one-third of which will be spent on the facades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin already has no shortage of tourist attractions ceo peter brockhaus sees it as " an investment in the future , " with the new-look neighborhood set to house european-themed specialty stores and eateries , such as tapas bars in madrid , pasta restaurants in milan and smart boutiques in paris . hellersdorf is pinning its hopes on the mini-europe .

a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .
like most of his clients and employees , he speaks fluent german as well as turkish .
still , he produces tv commercials in turkish that are aimed at second-generation , german-speaking turks . " wherever it makes sense to be bilingual , we 'll be bilingual , " calmaz said .
" i 've lived here for years and feel comfortable here , but i was born in turkey .
i 'm from there and i want to be seen in that way .
and many people feel the same way .
although they speak german well and have many german friends , they want to be perceived as turks in germany .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

eventually , he was shot by hunters , on the order of authorities who feared he might attack people while foraging for food . but the tale of bruno did not , would not , end with his death .
now , authorities have decreed that his carcass should be moved from its current home to a freezer in a secret location . the body of the folk-hero bear - visitors still flock to the schliersee region to place wooden crosses at the site where he was killed - has been at the animal anatomy department of munich university since the death of bruno , last june . but after the head of the department received threats from animal-rights activists the authorities moved the remains to an undisclosed location , the bavarian environment ministry said on wednesday . officials said specimens of bone and internal organs of the animal would be made available to scientists for research purposes , while the animal 's pelt was being prepared so that it could be stuffed and displayed in a museum at some later date . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bruno finds final resting place in germany even though bavaria can hardly be called a good host after shooting and killing him , the german state has refused to give back the remains of wandering brown bear bruno to italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 18.10.2006 does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's coach has n't had much joy this year none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .
german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally .

despite the fact that rigor mortis set in long ago , the saga of bruno the bear has taken yet another turn . bruno may have been killed by a bullet , but his story refuses to die . bruno was spotted earlier this year in the southern german alps , the first brown bear to dare show his hide in bavaria in 150 years . an effort to track the elusive ursine led to a media watch rivlling paris hilton 's .
eventually , he was shot by hunters , on the order of authorities who feared he might attack people while foraging for food . but the tale of bruno did not , would not , end with his death .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .

" the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .
with community their first priority , locals ' own visions for the neighborhood are always integrated into the final designs . the community spirit does n't stop there .
in hellersdorf , the project is also designed to get out-of-work painters and decorators back in business and to offer young people an opportunity to gain some skills . theme park funding for " europa quarter " has been in place for several months .
austrian property giant level one , which acquired the 100 high-rises , is willing to pour 15 million euros -lrb- $ 18.8 million -rrb- in their renovation - one-third of which will be spent on the facades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin already has no shortage of tourist attractions ceo peter brockhaus sees it as " an investment in the future , " with the new-look neighborhood set to house european-themed specialty stores and eateries , such as tapas bars in madrid , pasta restaurants in milan and smart boutiques in paris . hellersdorf is pinning its hopes on the mini-europe .

locals still remember her as a hippie with a cause . michelle bachelet and her mother arrived in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- in 1975 , after both were detained and tortured by the regime of augusto pinochet .
her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse . " her mother was bourgeois , she could not understand that we had to line up outside of shops , " she said . socialist agreement the bachelets were invited to the gdr under an agreement between the east german authorities and the socialist party of chile , which bachelet had joined as a student in santiago . she recently told the german weekly newspaper die zeit that she has fond memories of her four years behind the iron curtain , recalling that it is where she married her now estranged husband , fellow chilean exile jorge davalos , in 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet celebrating her presidential victory with her family " whether the readers like to hear this or not , the time i spent in potsdam and leipzig was a very happy part of my life , " she said .
" i was 23 years old when i came here .
i could continue my studies .
i got married and it is also the place where i had my first child .
my experience in germany was beautiful . " elke pissarek 's husband detlev said he remembered a young woman with firm political views who loved to play music with her chilean friends in the basement of the gray apartment block they shared . " we became like one big family , " he remembers fondly .
" she was discreet , not pushy at all , but at the same time she was politically engaged and in favor of radical solutions .
she was clearly ready to return to chile and to take up arms for her beliefs , " he told afp news agency . flower power bachelet returned to chile in 1979 , but potsdam is still home to many of the chileans who came here some 30 years ago . one of them , luis gonzalez , recalls a 1970s flower-child with a serious streak . " she was slim and beautiful , she looked like a hippie with her long hair and her jeans .
but one could see that she was a leader , that she knew how to inspire people , " he said . bachelet 's old neighbors said they still follow her political career with interest and pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachelet had something to celebrate after winning the election this year " in a way , she cut her teeth here .
i think it is great that she has remained true to her convictions , " detlev pissarek said , while his wife said she hoped bachelet could inspire all of latin america to swing to the left . bachelet 's visit will not take her to potsdam , but she will stop in leipzig , the eastern city where she spent months studying german at what was then called karl marx university . back home in late 1978 , she moved to east berlin to pursue her medical studies at humboldt university .
five months later , she received permission from the chilean authorities to return home and bade europe farewell . bachelet was elected chile 's first female leader late last year , just after angela merkel , who grew up in east germany , became the united country 's first female chancellor . the two women are due to hold talks during bachelet 's three-day visit , her first official trip to germany since taking office . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-latin america summit opens in vienna the european union opens a three-day latin america summit in vienna on thursday with the world 's oil crisis set to top the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 18.10.2006 " ethno-marketing " helps german firms expand customer base großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany increasingly , german companies are expanding their markets without going overseas .
a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .

but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .

a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .
like most of his clients and employees , he speaks fluent german as well as turkish .
still , he produces tv commercials in turkish that are aimed at second-generation , german-speaking turks . " wherever it makes sense to be bilingual , we 'll be bilingual , " calmaz said .
" i 've lived here for years and feel comfortable here , but i was born in turkey .
i 'm from there and i want to be seen in that way .
and many people feel the same way .
although they speak german well and have many german friends , they want to be perceived as turks in germany .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .

german soccer experts say fatigue from this summer 's world cup is only one of the reasons . the bundesliga table , with bremen , bayern and schalke at the top , may look normal , but do n't be deceived .
the trio of leaders are all on 13 points - which would have left them tied for fifth in the standings at this point last season .
the bundesliga 's giants have failed thus far to live up to their lofty expectations .
mighty bayern have already lost to bielefeld and wolfsburg , bremen 's potent attack has looked scattershot , and hamburg , another pre-season favorite , are in the relegation zone , having not won a competitive match since august . before the start of the current campaign , bayern coach felix magath predicted his team would suffer from world cup fatigue .
but is this summer 's global football festival really to blame for mediocrity at the top ? self-fulfilling prophecies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrations abound for defending champs munich of the contenders , bayern and bremen have the most world cup veterans .
magath , for instance , was forced to run some pre-season practices with only five players , while the rest recovered from the tournament .
robert mucha , an editor at the soccer magazine 11 freunde , said a certain mental tiredness is understandable .
" for two years players were obsessed with the world cup .
then all of a sudden the pressure is gone , and with it their concentration . "
jürgen schmieder from the online edition of munich 's süddeutsche zeitung agreed : " it 's difficult to adjust , both physically and mentally . " but reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of germany 's leading soccer publication , kicker , said the world cup was no excuse : " at the very latest , any fatigue has to be over after the fourth week of the season .
in the past few years , we 've seen that german clubs have n't been very competitive internationally . "
markus hesselmann , chief sports editor for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel newspaper , concurred .
" look at the other european leagues , " he pointed out .
" chelsea and barcelona are playing fine . "
hesselmann said he thought world cup fatigue was a specifically german phenomenon .
" everyone was worried about it , " he observed , " and at some point it became a self-fulfilling prophecy . "
questions of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's new playmaker diego has n't always found his way personnel changes , more than fatigue , seemed to have tripped up the big clubs coming out of the blocks .
soccer experts agree that bayern underestimated the effect michael ballack 's departure to chelsea would have on the club .
" ballack was their captain and the man who controlled matches , " holzschuh said .
" they 've had to revise their system . "
hesselmann seconded that thought : " they miss his strength in the air . " bremen have had similar trouble adjusting to the loss of former playmaker johann micoud .
but the most drastic problems have been in hamburg - last season 's third-place finishers have plummeted all the way to 17th in the table . hamburg gave into players ' wishes in the off-season and sold off their two starting interior defenders .
but jürgen schmieder said the departure of 34-year-old striker sergei barbarez , a long-time fan favorite whom hamburg refused to re-sign , may have been more of a blow .
" it 's not just a matter of playing ability , " schmieder commented .
" it 's a question of leadership . " like a pimply teenager bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have gone from top to flop holzschuh said the problems in hamburg went beyond any one player .
" ever since last winter , hamburg 's transfer policies have been ripping apart the team 's chemistry , " he said , citing jealousy between hamburg 's veterans and their more recent signings .
a major reason for hamburg 's struggles this year has been a rash of red cards - a lack of discipline which holzschuh said shows that " the players are n't mentally in control . " and what 's true of hamburg also applies to schalke .
the bundesliga 's perennial also-rans have no reason for world cup fatigue and did n't lose any key players .
but they 've been hit by squabbling , most notably a public spat between veteran gerald asamoah and new signing halil altintop . matti lieske , sports editor for the berliner zeitung newspaper , blamed management .
" i have the feeling that problems got carried over from last season .
schalke 's management seems incapable of taming this team . "
schmieder offered a more picturesque analysis : " schalke is like a pimply teenager who finally succeeds in getting a date with the prom queen - only to wreck the car on the way . " the season could come down to the question of how quickly the top teams get players and coaches on the same page and end the current spell of mediocrity .
but parity does have one advantage .

her father , alberto , was an ally of the late marxist president salvador allende and died of a heart attack after enduring prison and torture for months . his wife and daughter came to east germany via australia , joining about 40 other chilean refugee families in potsdam , just southwest of then divided berlin . " we were told that chileans were moving in next door and that we should help them settle - tell them how german society works and show them where the shops are , " remembers elke pissarek , a former neighbor in potsdam 's lilienstrasse .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks . " president barroso has clarified that indeed there is no element that suggests that any rule has not been respected - so the rules have been observed , " said the commissioner 's spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commissioner criticizes " arrogant " brussels officials eu industry commissioner günter verheugen told a german newspaper that his job is a constant bureaucratic power struggle .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .
it 's in everyone 's interests that ankara and nicosia jump over their shadows if the 32-year-old cyprus conflict is ever going to end . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , cyprus agree on accession talks with turkey the eu overcame last-minute objections from cyprus monday to start detailed membership talks with turkey , narrowly avoiding a new crisis for the beleaguered bloc .

a new focus on ethno-marketing is helping them reach out to the country 's large turkish population . the german coffee-selling chain tchibo is introducing turkish coffee to the market .
to test consumer reaction to a new product , the company gave out samples at a turkish supermarket in germany . the sales campaign was designed by the berlin advertising agency beys .
the agency , run by two second-generation turks , specializes in the growing branch of " ethno-advertising . "
it aims in particular at the underdeveloped turkish market segment . " german enterprises have reservations about -lrb- selling to turks -rrb- .
the market is a bit too distant for them , " said atilla ciftci , managing director of beys . ciftci says he sees beys ' mission as helping german companies better understand their turkish clientele . buying power for ' heavy users ' " they do n't have a good feeling for the market .
that 's why they need agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing .
and there are n't very many - the market is still developing , " said ciftci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's turkish consumers are modern according to ciftci , turkish consumers respond to different advertising than germans do .
" the wording and designs are more intensive , more color intensive .
the wording should be more aggressive and more emotional , " he said . it 's estimated that the 2.5 million ethnic turks in germany spend between 17 and 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 and $ 25 billion -rrb- a year on consumer goods and services .
according to beys , second and third generation turks in germany no longer fit the image of their parents ' and grandparents ' generation , who are seen as having been frugal in order to save up to buy a house in turkey . instead , beys claims on its web site , they are " heavy users " who " like to shop a lot , are brand-savvy , and put a lot of value on high-quality products .
luxury carmakers long ago honed in on the turkish market segment , with us automaker daimlerchrysler targeting turkish consumers in germany - employing turkish sales staff and putting out turkish television commercials - for over a decade . all about appearances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion is important to young turkish consumers mobile phones and technology are another big segment for ethno-marketing .
in 2005 , german mobile-phone provider e-plus created the ay yildiz telephone service .
subscribers to ay yildiz - which means " moon and stars , " symbols on the turkish flag - pay only around half as much as other german companies charge for calls to turkey . the head of ay yildiz , dogan calmaz , has lived in germany for 33 years .
like most of his clients and employees , he speaks fluent german as well as turkish .
still , he produces tv commercials in turkish that are aimed at second-generation , german-speaking turks . " wherever it makes sense to be bilingual , we 'll be bilingual , " calmaz said .
" i 've lived here for years and feel comfortable here , but i was born in turkey .
i 'm from there and i want to be seen in that way .
and many people feel the same way .
although they speak german well and have many german friends , they want to be perceived as turks in germany .

over 1,000 people have fallen ill from contamination since then ; at least 10 have died .

now the next stage is on the agenda : " we 're preparing the toxic waste for transportation by sea back to europe , " petigan said via satellite phone . that sounds easier than it is . analyses have to be conducted to determine what kind of hazardous waste it is exactly and to which european countries the various types of waste can be sent . ivorian-based french waste management company tredi has commissioned petigan with the task .
ivorian officials have requested that he get the environmental catastrophe under control , but that requires time . the 500 tons of toxic waste will not be transported back to europe for another three to four weeks . but a much greater problem remains . tons more toxic waste than before bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says toxic sludge was dumped at 17 different sites around abidjan " we 're only talking about the 500 tons of waste that was deposited here and is to be sent back , " said petigan .
" but the whole area in abidjan - soil , water , concrete - was contaminated .
that has to be transported out of here too , and there are several thousand tons of that , " he added . in other words , europe will be getting back a lot more of the toxic waste than it shipped off to the third world in the first place .
no one knows yet where the toxic waste can be processed and deposited . the european union has around 30 special depositories for toxic waste - primarily in countries that had nothing to do with the scandal , such as france , germany and belgium . black market mess the french government , out of a sense of obligation as the former colonial power of the ivory coast , said it was willing to dispose of the waste in special depositories in france . that , however , does not change matters when it comes to political responsibilities . " probo koala " was the name of the greek ship that transported the toxic waste .
it left port in amsterdam uncontested , though dutch authorities should have stopped it , since the eu bans the export of hazardous waste . barbara helfferich , a spokeswoman for the european commission , is quite clear on the matter .
" the political responsibility lays with the eu member states , in this case , with the netherlands , " she said . " the problem is , we 're dealing with a huge black market here , and it is difficult to take action against the culprits , " she added . the scandal reflects only the tip of the iceberg , helfferich said , and pointed to random tests done at various european ports : half of the waste to be transported - which was declared " non-toxic " - turned out to be toxic after all . always on the go those who try to kick up even more dirt stumble across an obscure web of economic interests and company involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas - in front of the probo koala tanker - now has his hands full the probo koala toxic waste freighter is a greek ship that flies under a panamanian flag , but which is commissioned by international raw materials corporation trafigura , which has its headquarters in lucerne , switzerland . according to news reports , trafigura has turnover of nearly $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- a year and 55 offices in 36 different countries on several different continents . the corporation 's lawyers are on the road a lot these days .
a couple of months ago , they were in the united states , where trafigura was fined $ 20 million for illegal oil exports out of iraq . trafigura appears to be a specialist in risky business deals in raw materials .
in a statement , the company claimed to have not sent toxic waste to the ivory coast .
it said that the cargo was harmless and must have been contaminated by a local transportation company . trafigura , however , has offered to send its attorneys to the ivory coast . martin durm -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for g8 partnerships with africa german chancellor angela merkel plans to use berlin 's g8 presidency to make the group of most industrialized nations and russia take an active role in development projects in africa , according to press reports .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks . " president barroso has clarified that indeed there is no element that suggests that any rule has not been respected - so the rules have been observed , " said the commissioner 's spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commissioner criticizes " arrogant " brussels officials eu industry commissioner günter verheugen told a german newspaper that his job is a constant bureaucratic power struggle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.10.2006 opinion : cyprus issue should n't spike turkey eu accession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless both turkey and cyprus jump over their shadows , ankara can forget any further accession talks with the eu , says dw 's berndt riegert . in the stand-off over ankara 's recognition of the greek-cypriot government in nicosia , the eu has appealed to both sides to compromise .
on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .
the eu inherited this problem when it admitted cyprus in 2004 even though the greek cypriot government in nicosia had rejected the un 's reunification plan in april that year . hopefully , olli rehn 's plea that both sides start to compromise will have resulted in more flexibility by december .
finland , which currently holds the six-month eu presidency , has already fleshed out new ways to postpone resolution until the elections in turkey next year . but turkey is going to have to accept that the only way forward is to recognize eu member cyprus if it too wants to join the club . there 's no point in the eu harping on about the armenian question and turkey 's outrage at french lawmakers ' adoption of a bill which makes it a crime to deny the armenian genocide - the country 's failure to come to terms with its past is no reason for the accession talks to break down .
nor is it helpful to say turkey is being given the run-around by the eu , by constantly coming up with new entry conditions - which is simply wrong .
admitting the armenian genocide has never been a condition of turkey 's accession , but freedom of opinion and freedom of the press have .
and solving the cyprus question most certainly has . equally undeniable is the fact that these trying , long-winded negotiations are doing nothing to boost turkey 's standing in brussels .
it 's in everyone 's interests that ankara and nicosia jump over their shadows if the 32-year-old cyprus conflict is ever going to end . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , cyprus agree on accession talks with turkey the eu overcame last-minute objections from cyprus monday to start detailed membership talks with turkey , narrowly avoiding a new crisis for the beleaguered bloc .

on monday , enlargement commissioner olli rehn warned they may be facing what he called " the last window of opportunity for several years " to make progress on the cyprus issue . cyprus has threatened to block further negotiations if turkey refuses to open its ports to cypriot ships as it does for traffic from other eu countries .
for its part , turkey is pushing for an end to the direct trade embargo on the turkish part of cyprus , a move which cyprus opposes . ultimately , its attitude is leading to an ever-widening gulf between brussels and the ankara , and both parties will have to beware it does n't become insurmountable by the end of the year . if the accession talks with turkey really do break down , it would mark a considerable defeat for european foreign policy .
the eu 's reputation in turkey would be badly shaken for the foreseeable future , and the pressure on ankara to introduce further democratic reforms would be instantly off - and above all , the strategically sound goal of bringing turkey closer into the european fold would be put on the back burner .
meanwhile , within the eu , the latent dispute between turkey 's supporters such as britain and its critics such as france would inevitably rise to the surface and even boil over . the unresolved cyprus question , which could precipitate a premature end to turkey 's accession talks , needs to be solved within the next few weeks , before the commission issues its next progress report on turkey 's candidacy in early november .
but the failure of the talks in luxembourg monday to make any headway suggests there 's more reason than ever to doubt that a solution is in reach . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül insisted that ankara will only recognize cyprus when the eu agrees to recognize the turkish cypriot northern cyprus .
but the eu pointed out that turkey has already contractually agreed to opening itself up to cypriot ships and airplanes , thereby indirectly recognizing the greek cypriot government which represents the divided island in the eu . the cypriot government is also digging its heels in by using its eu veto to block the opening of any new " chapter " or policy area in talks with turkey .

despite the fact that rigor mortis set in long ago , the saga of bruno the bear has taken yet another turn . bruno may have been killed by a bullet , but his story refuses to die . bruno was spotted earlier this year in the southern german alps , the first brown bear to dare show his hide in bavaria in 150 years . an effort to track the elusive ursine led to a media watch rivlling paris hilton 's .

günter verheugen is facing mounting criticism after a german newsmagazine published a picture of him hand-in-hand with the head of his brussels cabinet during a holiday on the baltic coast . the gossip has been doing the rounds in brussels for several months , and photos published in the german media monday would seem to prove it .
the eu 's vice president and industry commissioner , günter verheugen , has found himself in the hot seat over his alleged affair with petra erler , the head of his cabinet , with many convinced he showed favoritism when he gave her the top job in april . " her expertise was not the only factor in erler 's appointment , " said markus ferber -lrb- csu -rrb- , a member of the european parliament , on public broadcaster zdf . many would agree with him , but there 's no denying her suitability for the job .
in 1990 , erler served as state secretary under east germany 's last prime minister lothar de maizière .
nine years later , she joined verheugen at the commission to work on the bloc 's eastwards expansion and gained an excellent reputation that many would argue makes her an obvious choice for the position she now holds . incriminating pictures but that has n't stopped the rumor mill from turning . the picture that appears to corroborate the affair shows verheugen - who has been married for 19 years - walking hand-in-hand with erler through the lithuanian town of klaipeda , during a two-week holiday on the baltic coast . " we never made a secret of the fact that we took a vacation together , " 48-year-old erler told focus , but denied their relationship went beyond friendship . in an interview with tabloid bild , verheugen insisted erler fully deserved her promotion earlier this year .
" her abilities are beyond doubt , " he said .
" she is highly skilled .
the accusations that i have mixed business with pleasure are absurd . " verheugen described the allegations of favoritism as " pure slander . " it was a private trip , and i reject speculations linked to this matter , " he said , adding that " we will declare on oath that at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . " attack on eu red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumors are flying in brussels last week saw verheugen lash out at officials in brussels , telling the süddeutsche zeitung that his job is a constant power struggle with bureaucrats . " developments in the past decade have given officials so much power that the most important political task of the 25 commissioners is to control the bureaucratic apparatus , " he said .
" and sometimes control over the apparatus is lost . " verheugen also described reports written by eu officials as " technical , arrogant and condescending . "
he blamed the power of officials for the excessive red tape in the eu and said he believed european firms could make a saving of 75 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- if bureaucracy was reduced . hidden agenda some observers have suggested that the erler case would never have been raised had the commissioner not delivered such a stinging criticism of his own officials , while others have suggested the surprise outburst might have been a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the rumors . for the time being , those officials have closed ranks . " president barroso has clarified that indeed there is no element that suggests that any rule has not been respected - so the rules have been observed , " said the commissioner 's spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commissioner criticizes " arrogant " brussels officials eu industry commissioner günter verheugen told a german newspaper that his job is a constant bureaucratic power struggle .

over 1,000 people have fallen ill from contamination since then ; at least 10 have died .
now , the waste is heading back to europe . henri petigan is the man doing the dirty work in abidjan , the former capital of ivory coast .
for weeks now , he has been transporting tons of contaminated soil , rocks and mud in the city .
most of the material is in closed containers .
now the next stage is on the agenda : " we 're preparing the toxic waste for transportation by sea back to europe , " petigan said via satellite phone . that sounds easier than it is . analyses have to be conducted to determine what kind of hazardous waste it is exactly and to which european countries the various types of waste can be sent . ivorian-based french waste management company tredi has commissioned petigan with the task .
ivorian officials have requested that he get the environmental catastrophe under control , but that requires time . the 500 tons of toxic waste will not be transported back to europe for another three to four weeks . but a much greater problem remains . tons more toxic waste than before bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says toxic sludge was dumped at 17 different sites around abidjan " we 're only talking about the 500 tons of waste that was deposited here and is to be sent back , " said petigan .
" but the whole area in abidjan - soil , water , concrete - was contaminated .
that has to be transported out of here too , and there are several thousand tons of that , " he added . in other words , europe will be getting back a lot more of the toxic waste than it shipped off to the third world in the first place .
no one knows yet where the toxic waste can be processed and deposited . the european union has around 30 special depositories for toxic waste - primarily in countries that had nothing to do with the scandal , such as france , germany and belgium . black market mess the french government , out of a sense of obligation as the former colonial power of the ivory coast , said it was willing to dispose of the waste in special depositories in france . that , however , does not change matters when it comes to political responsibilities . " probo koala " was the name of the greek ship that transported the toxic waste .
it left port in amsterdam uncontested , though dutch authorities should have stopped it , since the eu bans the export of hazardous waste . barbara helfferich , a spokeswoman for the european commission , is quite clear on the matter .
" the political responsibility lays with the eu member states , in this case , with the netherlands , " she said . " the problem is , we 're dealing with a huge black market here , and it is difficult to take action against the culprits , " she added . the scandal reflects only the tip of the iceberg , helfferich said , and pointed to random tests done at various european ports : half of the waste to be transported - which was declared " non-toxic " - turned out to be toxic after all . always on the go those who try to kick up even more dirt stumble across an obscure web of economic interests and company involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas - in front of the probo koala tanker - now has his hands full the probo koala toxic waste freighter is a greek ship that flies under a panamanian flag , but which is commissioned by international raw materials corporation trafigura , which has its headquarters in lucerne , switzerland . according to news reports , trafigura has turnover of nearly $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- a year and 55 offices in 36 different countries on several different continents . the corporation 's lawyers are on the road a lot these days .
a couple of months ago , they were in the united states , where trafigura was fined $ 20 million for illegal oil exports out of iraq . trafigura appears to be a specialist in risky business deals in raw materials .
in a statement , the company claimed to have not sent toxic waste to the ivory coast .
it said that the cargo was harmless and must have been contaminated by a local transportation company . trafigura , however , has offered to send its attorneys to the ivory coast . martin durm -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for g8 partnerships with africa german chancellor angela merkel plans to use berlin 's g8 presidency to make the group of most industrialized nations and russia take an active role in development projects in africa , according to press reports .

"
the neighborhood is hoping it marks a new dawn for one of the capital 's most unloved districts . back in the days of communist propaganda , " potemkin village " was a term used to describe the attempts of the soviet government to fool foreign visitors .
the government would take them to carefully chosen villages , factories , schools and neighborhoods , and make out they were typical , rather than exceptional , examples of what the state had to offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf on the horizon - not a pretty sight the district of hellersdorf-marzahn was probably never one of them .
tucked away on the outskirts of the former east berlin , it 's a typical example of grim , socialist housing and urban decay . but now it 's about to come into its own as a potemkin village of a very artistic sort . trompe l 'oeil it 's not the first time berlin has tried to make hellersdorf hip .
the shopping mall near the subway station was built in the 1990s as part of the neighborhood 's post-reunification makeover .
and while it was going up , many of the grim high-rises surrounding it were being torn down , in an effort to revitalize this desolate suburb of eastern berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new facade the ones that remain still look as drab as ever , but the latest innovation foresees revamping 64,000 square meters -lrb- 690,000 square feet -rrb- of six residential blocks along the " hellersdorf promenade " with facades that recreate the look of traditional houses in european cities from amsterdam and warsaw to london and lisbon . according to its organizers , it will be the " biggest mural in the world . " the europa quarter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hellersdorf house due for completion in 2008 , a sneak preview of what the ambitious and atmospheric " europa quarter " will eventually look like is already available in the form of the " hellersdorf house . " the artists commissioned to revive the district 's flagging fortunes are the art collective " cité de la creation , " whose frescoes are among the french city of lyon 's most popular tourist attractions . the artists cite mexican tradition as an inspiration , saying they base their work on the sort of arte muralista developed by diego rivera and describing urban renewal as their ultimate goal .
with community their first priority , locals ' own visions for the neighborhood are always integrated into the final designs . the community spirit does n't stop there .
in hellersdorf , the project is also designed to get out-of-work painters and decorators back in business and to offer young people an opportunity to gain some skills . theme park funding for " europa quarter " has been in place for several months .
austrian property giant level one , which acquired the 100 high-rises , is willing to pour 15 million euros -lrb- $ 18.8 million -rrb- in their renovation - one-third of which will be spent on the facades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin already has no shortage of tourist attractions ceo peter brockhaus sees it as " an investment in the future , " with the new-look neighborhood set to house european-themed specialty stores and eateries , such as tapas bars in madrid , pasta restaurants in milan and smart boutiques in paris . hellersdorf is pinning its hopes on the mini-europe .

the firm 's profits fell 35 % to $ 1.3bn -lrb- £ 694m -rrb- in the three months to september as sales fell 12 % to $ 8.7bn.
despite the twin decline , performance was still ahead of market expectations and intel shares traded broadly flat .
the firm is trying to boost efficiency as it seeks to recover market share , and is planning to cut 10,000 jobs .
record shipments costs associated with this restructuring and a write-down of the value of old micro processing technology hit its performance over the period .
but the firm said it expected revenues to be higher at between $ 9.1bn and $ 9.7bn in the final three months of the year .
" we are pleased with the results , with record mobile and server processor shipments , strong manufacturing execution and industry acclaim for our new products , " said chief executive paul otellini .
in other earnings news , ibm reported a 47 % increase in third-quarter profits to $ 2.2bn as sales rose 5 % to $ 22.6bn.
ibm , which sold its pc manufacturing arm to china 's lenovo last year , saw strong growth in its software and business services operations .
" our strong performance is the result of excellent execution and the repositioning of ibm 's business model to capture the growth and profit areas of a rapidly changing it industry , " said chief executive samuel palmisano .

the production is the first new version to be authorised by the late welsh poet 's estate for 25 years .
produced and directed by michael bogdanov , the wales theatre company show opens in swansea and goes onto venues around wales .
aeronwy thomas , the poet 's daughter , said : " people like to remember christmas as it was , pre-technology . "
neath-born bogdanov marked the 50th anniversary of thomas ' death with a stage version of thomas ' " play for voices " , under milkwood . "
even some of thomas ' adult poems were about his childhood - some people may say he was obsessed with his childhood " dave woolley , dylan thomas centre he has collaborated with american musician and composer jack herrick for his new production , which has a dozen original numbers for the musical 's cast of 10 .
bogdanov told bbc news that he had always planned to add a child 's christmas in wales , the poet 's lyrical evocation of festive season memories , to his list of credits .
he said : " it 's a beautiful christmas story .
there are so few genuine lyrical christmas stories and this just lends itself .
" i have always been more than a thomas fan in as much my mother loved his poetry used to read it to me as child and always talked about him as a bohemian .
" i hope the people of swansea will recognise the man through the piece and the lyrical qualities will come through and also the scurrility of the humour . "
aeronwy thomas , a beneficiary of the thomas estate but with no control over its decisions , said she was confident bogdanov 's " avant garde " approach would be right for the piece .
she said : " his under milkwood was superb .
he is a very gifted director .
he had taken a few chances .
he took it a stage further because it was slightly surreal . "
she recently read a child 's christmas in wales to an audience at st paul 's church , knightsbridge .
she added : " i read it slowly and found the audience started laughing .
i think they liked the dialogue between the boys .
" people like to remember christmas as it was , pre- technology , when children were not stuck in front of a computer or television , and were out snowballing cats . "
' obsesses with childhood ' the show opens on wednesday night at the city 's grand theatre , the company 's base .
swansea 's ninth annual tribute to its best known son , the dylan thomas festival , runs from 27 october , the date of his birth , to 5 november , the date of his death .
festival organiser dave woolley , said : " as a christmas tale , a child 's christmas in wales is very nostalgic .
it 's a sort of timeless story as far as children are concerned . "
" a lot of his poetry is about looking backwards .
even some of thomas 's adult poems were about his childhood .
some people may say he was obsessed with his childhood . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- broadband uk needs ' more speed ' bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 18 october 2006 , 07:33 gmt 08:33 uk broadband uk needs ' more speed ' three-quarters of uk online households will connect to the web via broadband by december 2006 , analysts predict .
jupiter research says faster speeds will help drive user-generated content such as youtube and photo site flickr .
but while uptake has helped the uk to the broadband fast track , lack of speed compared to other countries could still see it derailed .
experts warn the uk is falling behind its european counterparts when it comes to speed .
time online high-speed net access has become as necessary as electricity or water to many .
it has been a remarkable take-up of a technology five years ago many had not even heard of , let alone thought they could n't live without .
but what impact is it actually making on lives ?
has it , as predicted by some , transformed the way we use the web , and by association our lives , or is it simply a means of doing what people have always done online but faster .
broadband is certainly holding our attention - with high-speed surfers spending around six hours more online each week than those still using dial-up .
but there has yet to be a sea-change in the things they do online .
e-mail remains the most widely used application with surfing for information and shopping being the most widespread internet activities , according to findings from research firm pointtopic .
the average online customer is spending £ 1,290 per year online , according to pointtopic .
slow man of europe ?
what broadband households are doing online email - 68 % blogging , browsing or surfing - 66 % shopping - 49 % visiting ebay or other auction sites - 33 % banking or other financial transactions - 31 % chat or instant messaging - 27 % downloading music , games , pictures etc - 26 % online games - 15 % listening to radio - 13 % swapping files with others - 9 % webcam or video calls - 8 % watching live tv or other streaming video - 4 % other / gambling - 3 % make telephone calls - 3 % some had predicted that this year could see an explosion in the use of online video and net telephony but according to pointtopic these applications are making an impact in less than 10 % of online householders .
increasingly , broadband is allowing people to contribute back to the net rather than just being passive downloaders of content .
firms such as google are so excited about the future of user-generated content that they are prepared to pay billions for a slice of the action .
but if such content is to take off it will need faster speeds to enable people to upload pictures and video effortlessly , thinks jupiter analyst ian fogg .
" the speeds that are available in the uk are lagging a long , long way behind other european counties , " he said .
in the uk the fastest speed currently on offer is 24mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- although typically the fastest people will get is about 8mbps .
french surfers are enjoying around 24mbps as standard .
bt does not plan to roll out its next-generation broadband until the middle of 2007 .
last year saw a flurry of announcements about faster and faster net connections courtesy of next-generation broadband - adsl2 - which promised speeds of up to 24mbps for everyone .
it was a promise that pointtopic was sceptical about at the time - warning that as few as 5 % of the uk population would actually get speeds above 18mbps .
the advertising standards agency has also questioned internet service provider 's inflated claims about speed .
speed is no longer the way providers are trying to capture new customers .
in its place has come a new price war with internet service providers competing to offer free broadband bundled with telephone services .
have your say " who actually thought you would get better broadband by allowing cowboy operators into telephone exchanges ? "
colin campbell , stockholm send us your experiences carphone warehouse offers one of these packages and has seen its subscribers leap from 100,000 at the end of march 2006 to 247,000 by end of july .
its free broadband service was made possible on the back of local loop unbundling , which may not be a term that comes readily to many people 's lips .
llu means rivals to bt can install their equipment in telephone exchanges , which allows them to offer cheaper and innovative services without relying on the telecoms giant .
but carphone warehouse has had problems coping with demand as the process of local loop unbundling can be complex and slow .
of the 625,000 customers who have signed up for its free broadband service , only 20,000 are on unbundled lines , said mr fogg .
digital divide the flurry of cheap or free offers and the subsequent problems people have had getting their service will ensure that price , quality of service and quality of network remain the three most important factors for people looking to upgrade to broadband , he thinks .
since broadband began making its impact on the uk net market there have been concerns that there could be a divide between those with access to high-speed services and those without .
the nature of local loop unbundling has meant that it is much more attractive for companies to offer services in areas of high populations - ie towns and cities - because it maximises profit .
it means those in remoter areas are still missing out on the super-fast speeds their urban cousins are enjoying .
while broadband is now available to around 99 % of the uk , pointtopic predicts that around 30 % of the country will not access the cheaper , technically more sophisticated services that llu allows , opening up a new digital divide .

three-quarters of uk online households will connect to the web via broadband by december 2006 , analysts predict .
jupiter research says faster speeds will help drive user-generated content such as youtube and photo site flickr .
but while uptake has helped the uk to the broadband fast track , lack of speed compared to other countries could still see it derailed .
experts warn the uk is falling behind its european counterparts when it comes to speed .
time online high-speed net access has become as necessary as electricity or water to many .
it has been a remarkable take-up of a technology five years ago many had not even heard of , let alone thought they could n't live without .
but what impact is it actually making on lives ?
has it , as predicted by some , transformed the way we use the web , and by association our lives , or is it simply a means of doing what people have always done online but faster .
broadband is certainly holding our attention - with high-speed surfers spending around six hours more online each week than those still using dial-up .
but there has yet to be a sea-change in the things they do online .
e-mail remains the most widely used application with surfing for information and shopping being the most widespread internet activities , according to findings from research firm pointtopic .
the average online customer is spending £ 1,290 per year online , according to pointtopic .
slow man of europe ?
what broadband households are doing online email - 68 % blogging , browsing or surfing - 66 % shopping - 49 % visiting ebay or other auction sites - 33 % banking or other financial transactions - 31 % chat or instant messaging - 27 % downloading music , games , pictures etc - 26 % online games - 15 % listening to radio - 13 % swapping files with others - 9 % webcam or video calls - 8 % watching live tv or other streaming video - 4 % other / gambling - 3 % make telephone calls - 3 % some had predicted that this year could see an explosion in the use of online video and net telephony but according to pointtopic these applications are making an impact in less than 10 % of online householders .
increasingly , broadband is allowing people to contribute back to the net rather than just being passive downloaders of content .
firms such as google are so excited about the future of user-generated content that they are prepared to pay billions for a slice of the action .
but if such content is to take off it will need faster speeds to enable people to upload pictures and video effortlessly , thinks jupiter analyst ian fogg .
" the speeds that are available in the uk are lagging a long , long way behind other european counties , " he said .
in the uk the fastest speed currently on offer is 24mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- although typically the fastest people will get is about 8mbps .
french surfers are enjoying around 24mbps as standard .
bt does not plan to roll out its next-generation broadband until the middle of 2007 .
last year saw a flurry of announcements about faster and faster net connections courtesy of next-generation broadband - adsl2 - which promised speeds of up to 24mbps for everyone .
it was a promise that pointtopic was sceptical about at the time - warning that as few as 5 % of the uk population would actually get speeds above 18mbps .
the advertising standards agency has also questioned internet service provider 's inflated claims about speed .
speed is no longer the way providers are trying to capture new customers .
in its place has come a new price war with internet service providers competing to offer free broadband bundled with telephone services .
have your say who actually thought you would get better broadband by allowing cowboy operators into telephone exchanges ?
colin campbell , stockholm send us your experiences carphone warehouse offers one of these packages and has seen its subscribers leap from 100,000 at the end of march 2006 to 247,000 by end of july .
its free broadband service was made possible on the back of local loop unbundling , which may not be a term that comes readily to many people 's lips .
llu means rivals to bt can install their equipment in telephone exchanges , which allows them to offer cheaper and innovative services without relying on the telecoms giant .
but carphone warehouse has had problems coping with demand as the process of local loop unbundling can be complex and slow .
of the 625,000 customers who have signed up for its free broadband service , only 20,000 are on unbundled lines , said mr fogg .
digital divide the flurry of cheap or free offers and the subsequent problems people have had getting their service will ensure that price , quality of service and quality of network remain the three most important factors for people looking to upgrade to broadband , he thinks .
since broadband began making its impact on the uk net market there have been concerns that there could be a divide between those with access to high-speed services and those without .
the nature of local loop unbundling has meant that it is much more attractive for companies to offer services in areas of high populations - ie towns and cities - because it maximises profit .
it means those in remoter areas are still missing out on the super-fast speeds their urban cousins are enjoying .
while broadband is now available to around 99 % of the uk , pointtopic predicts that around 30 % of the country will not access the cheaper , technically more sophisticated services that llu allows , opening up a new digital divide .

increasingly , broadband is allowing people to contribute back to the net rather than just being passive downloaders of content .
firms such as google are so excited about the future of user-generated content that they are prepared to pay billions for a slice of the action .
but if such content is to take off it will need faster speeds to enable people to upload pictures and video effortlessly , thinks jupiter analyst ian fogg .
" the speeds that are available in the uk are lagging a long , long way behind other european counties , " he said .
in the uk the fastest speed currently on offer is 24mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- although typically the fastest people will get is about 8mbps .

bt does not plan to roll out its next-generation broadband until the middle of 2007 .
last year saw a flurry of announcements about faster and faster net connections courtesy of next-generation broadband - adsl2 - which promised speeds of up to 24mbps for everyone .
it was a promise that pointtopic was sceptical about at the time - warning that as few as 5 % of the uk population would actually get speeds above 18mbps .
the advertising standards agency has also questioned internet service provider 's inflated claims about speed .
speed is no longer the way providers are trying to capture new customers .
in its place has come a new price war with internet service providers competing to offer free broadband bundled with telephone services .

its free broadband service was made possible on the back of local loop unbundling , which may not be a term that comes readily to many people 's lips .
llu means rivals to bt can install their equipment in telephone exchanges , which allows them to offer cheaper and innovative services without relying on the telecoms giant .
but carphone warehouse has had problems coping with demand as the process of local loop unbundling can be complex and slow .
of the 625,000 customers who have signed up for its free broadband service , only 20,000 are on unbundled lines , said mr fogg .
digital divide the flurry of cheap or free offers and the subsequent problems people have had getting their service will ensure that price , quality of service and quality of network remain the three most important factors for people looking to upgrade to broadband , he thinks .
since broadband began making its impact on the uk net market there have been concerns that there could be a divide between those with access to high-speed services and those without .
the nature of local loop unbundling has meant that it is much more attractive for companies to offer services in areas of high populations - ie towns and cities - because it maximises profit .
it means those in remoter areas are still missing out on the super-fast speeds their urban cousins are enjoying .
while broadband is now available to around 99 % of the uk , pointtopic predicts that around 30 % of the country will not access the cheaper , technically more sophisticated services that llu allows , opening up a new digital divide .

three-quarters of uk online households will connect to the web via broadband by december 2006 , analysts predict .
jupiter research says faster speeds will help drive user-generated content such as youtube and photo site flickr .
but while uptake has helped the uk to the broadband fast track , lack of speed compared to other countries could still see it derailed .
experts warn the uk is falling behind its european counterparts when it comes to speed .
time online high-speed net access has become as necessary as electricity or water to many .
it has been a remarkable take-up of a technology five years ago many had not even heard of , let alone thought they could n't live without .
but what impact is it actually making on lives ?
has it , as predicted by some , transformed the way we use the web , and by association our lives , or is it simply a means of doing what people have always done online but faster .
broadband is certainly holding our attention - with high-speed surfers spending around six hours more online each week than those still using dial-up .
but there has yet to be a sea-change in the things they do online .
e-mail remains the most widely used application with surfing for information and shopping being the most widespread internet activities , according to findings from research firm pointtopic .
the average online customer is spending £ 1,290 per year online , according to pointtopic .

what broadband households are doing online email - 68 % blogging , browsing or surfing - 66 % shopping - 49 % visiting ebay or other auction sites - 33 % banking or other financial transactions - 31 % chat or instant messaging - 27 % downloading music , games , pictures etc - 26 % online games - 15 % listening to radio - 13 % swapping files with others - 9 % webcam or video calls - 8 % watching live tv or other streaming video - 4 % other / gambling - 3 % make telephone calls - 3 % some had predicted that this year could see an explosion in the use of online video and net telephony but according to pointtopic these applications are making an impact in less than 10 % of online householders .
increasingly , broadband is allowing people to contribute back to the net rather than just being passive downloaders of content .
firms such as google are so excited about the future of user-generated content that they are prepared to pay billions for a slice of the action .
but if such content is to take off it will need faster speeds to enable people to upload pictures and video effortlessly , thinks jupiter analyst ian fogg .
" the speeds that are available in the uk are lagging a long , long way behind other european counties , " he said .
in the uk the fastest speed currently on offer is 24mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- although typically the fastest people will get is about 8mbps .
french surfers are enjoying around 24mbps as standard .
bt does not plan to roll out its next-generation broadband until the middle of 2007 .
last year saw a flurry of announcements about faster and faster net connections courtesy of next-generation broadband - adsl2 - which promised speeds of up to 24mbps for everyone .
it was a promise that pointtopic was sceptical about at the time - warning that as few as 5 % of the uk population would actually get speeds above 18mbps .
the advertising standards agency has also questioned internet service provider 's inflated claims about speed .
speed is no longer the way providers are trying to capture new customers .
in its place has come a new price war with internet service providers competing to offer free broadband bundled with telephone services .

" the progress that we 're seeing now is converting simple actuators and servers into something that kind of looks like a person , " said mr rogers .

in keeping with many of the robots , quasi looks lifelike , but beyond the most rudimentary interactions none of them can think for themselves .
as a result , many at nextfest predict the next great leaps will be in the field of artificial intelligence .
" these robots now , looking and acting very human , can walk into our lives and become friends - teachers , playmates , " said david hanson , president of hanson robotics .
" the progress in computing is not slowing - by most metrics it 's accelerating , which means that the next 50 years is going to see much more dramatic progress than the last 50 . "

" when we first started doing nextfest in san francisco , we had a robot that could walk , and that was amazing , " adam rogers of nextfest told bbc world service 's culture shock programme .
" this year , we have a robot that can dance .
it 's an elegant progression . "
being creative the robots designers say that what makes it extraordinary is its ability to react to the touch of a human .
nasa 's robotnaut is designed to work on mars in particular , it has been designed as a female - which has to respond to its human , male lead partner , rather than leading itself .
and it is this responsiveness which it is hoped can be applied to care for elderly people .
" people will have this idea of isolation , of how awful to have a machine or a robot looking after an elderly person , " said sheila moorcroft , a futures research consultant based in the uk .
" but you 've got to stand back from that image .
all the statistics show that we are an aging society , not just in the west but right the way across the globe .
" many older people want to stay in their own homes , so it 's actually then beginning to enable that to happen . "
other robots shown doing the work of humans included nasa 's robonaut , a cuddly robotic seal designed to calm patients with mental illness , and a video classroom assistant that allows sick children to attend school without leaving home .
" the progress that we 're seeing now is converting simple actuators and servers into something that kind of looks like a person , " said mr rogers .
" that 's kind of weird , because we do n't actually need it to look like a person .
but it 's something that can then be creative .
i think as human beings we want to build something that is as creative as ourselves . "
next great leaps one company attempting to do this is innerbots , which makes interactive robots .
a genuinely clever robot is still a long way off they displayed quasi , an advanced interactive robot whose eyes change colour according to his mood - red for angry , blue for sad , and so on .
however , to talk like a human , he still needs a human controller .
in keeping with many of the robots , quasi looks lifelike , but beyond the most rudimentary interactions none of them can think for themselves .
as a result , many at nextfest predict the next great leaps will be in the field of artificial intelligence .
" these robots now , looking and acting very human , can walk into our lives and become friends - teachers , playmates , " said david hanson , president of hanson robotics .
" the progress in computing is not slowing - by most metrics it 's accelerating , which means that the next 50 years is going to see much more dramatic progress than the last 50 . "
