" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved .

" the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2006 shedding light on europe 's long-lost empire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last of his kind : francis ii became austrian emperor after his abdication the holy roman empire of the german nation fell apart 200 years ago .
while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2006 shedding light on europe 's long-lost empire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last of his kind : francis ii became austrian emperor after his abdication the holy roman empire of the german nation fell apart 200 years ago .
while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .

naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .
the first is in the area of " graduate schools , " based on the schools ' concepts of how to promote young talent .
the second is financing for what is called " research clusters , " centers of excellence in a given field .
-lrb- a single university can apply for funding for several graduate schools and several clusters simultaneously . -rrb- schools that are awarded funding in these areas are then eligible for a third , more substantial source of funding - if they can present a dazzling vision of educational excellence for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ex-foreign minister joschka fischer has left politics - and gone to princeton it is the winners in this last category that will comprise the " elite " universities . on oct .
13 , the organizing committees will name the recipients , each of which can expect to receive around 21 million euros annually - though the amount will differ per school . next year , the whole process will take place again , resulting in the selection of another handful of super-schools , sometime in 2007 . in the end , the country hopes to establish around 10 such " elite " - or at least , better-funded - universities . prestige boost the idea , said beate konze-thomas of the german research foundation , which is organizing the selection process along with the scientific council , is for universities to make the most of their strengths . " -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .
we have universities that are older than 100 .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel . " by promoting the necessity of settlement of holocaust survivors in the occupied palestine , they have created a constant threat in the middle east , " he said , referring to israel . chancellor rejected " totally unacceptable " letter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was not amused by the letter from iran merkel on july 21 indicated that she would not formally respond to the letter , saying it contained " totally unacceptable " criticism of israel and " constantly put in question " the jewish state 's right to exist . ahmadinejad blamed what he described as propaganda after world war ii for making " some people feel historically guilty and indefinitely pay for the crimes of their fathers . " the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media . " iranian president praised germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's holocaust conference is set for december ahmadinejad in his letter also praised the german people as a nation with potential in science , art , philosophy and politics , but " who are not allowed to play their constructive role in the world . " " undoubtedly , we , our two governments and nations , can make big steps to resolve the existing global problems ... together we can convince some powers that respecting nations ' rights is in best interest of everybody , " ahmadinejad said . the publication of the letter coincided with a visit to berlin by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , where she urged the international community to stop the " threat " posed by iran 's nuclear program . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " livni said after talks with german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier . germany , along with france and britain , has been at the forefront of international diplomatic efforts to stop iran enriching uranium amid fears the islamic republic is planning to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

the 23-year-old student , identified as fadi a.s. , was believed to have done research on the internet with other suspects on how to construct a bomb like the ones found in the suitcases left on the trains . regarding a possible connection between the suspects and the al qaeda terrorist network , ziercke said only that that question is one that still has to be answered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal police office president jörg ziercke " the war on terror has been very difficult for al qaeda and it no longer has the operational abilities is did around the time of sept .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .
the first is in the area of " graduate schools , " based on the schools ' concepts of how to promote young talent .
the second is financing for what is called " research clusters , " centers of excellence in a given field .
-lrb- a single university can apply for funding for several graduate schools and several clusters simultaneously . -rrb- schools that are awarded funding in these areas are then eligible for a third , more substantial source of funding - if they can present a dazzling vision of educational excellence for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ex-foreign minister joschka fischer has left politics - and gone to princeton it is the winners in this last category that will comprise the " elite " universities . on oct .
13 , the organizing committees will name the recipients , each of which can expect to receive around 21 million euros annually - though the amount will differ per school . next year , the whole process will take place again , resulting in the selection of another handful of super-schools , sometime in 2007 . in the end , the country hopes to establish around 10 such " elite " - or at least , better-funded - universities . prestige boost the idea , said beate konze-thomas of the german research foundation , which is organizing the selection process along with the scientific council , is for universities to make the most of their strengths . " -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel . " by promoting the necessity of settlement of holocaust survivors in the occupied palestine , they have created a constant threat in the middle east , " he said , referring to israel . chancellor rejected " totally unacceptable " letter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was not amused by the letter from iran merkel on july 21 indicated that she would not formally respond to the letter , saying it contained " totally unacceptable " criticism of israel and " constantly put in question " the jewish state 's right to exist . ahmadinejad blamed what he described as propaganda after world war ii for making " some people feel historically guilty and indefinitely pay for the crimes of their fathers . " the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media . " iranian president praised germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's holocaust conference is set for december ahmadinejad in his letter also praised the german people as a nation with potential in science , art , philosophy and politics , but " who are not allowed to play their constructive role in the world . " " undoubtedly , we , our two governments and nations , can make big steps to resolve the existing global problems ... together we can convince some powers that respecting nations ' rights is in best interest of everybody , " ahmadinejad said . the publication of the letter coincided with a visit to berlin by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , where she urged the international community to stop the " threat " posed by iran 's nuclear program . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " livni said after talks with german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier . germany , along with france and britain , has been at the forefront of international diplomatic efforts to stop iran enriching uranium amid fears the islamic republic is planning to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel . " by promoting the necessity of settlement of holocaust survivors in the occupied palestine , they have created a constant threat in the middle east , " he said , referring to israel . chancellor rejected " totally unacceptable " letter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was not amused by the letter from iran merkel on july 21 indicated that she would not formally respond to the letter , saying it contained " totally unacceptable " criticism of israel and " constantly put in question " the jewish state 's right to exist . ahmadinejad blamed what he described as propaganda after world war ii for making " some people feel historically guilty and indefinitely pay for the crimes of their fathers . " the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media . " iranian president praised germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's holocaust conference is set for december ahmadinejad in his letter also praised the german people as a nation with potential in science , art , philosophy and politics , but " who are not allowed to play their constructive role in the world . " " undoubtedly , we , our two governments and nations , can make big steps to resolve the existing global problems ... together we can convince some powers that respecting nations ' rights is in best interest of everybody , " ahmadinejad said . the publication of the letter coincided with a visit to berlin by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , where she urged the international community to stop the " threat " posed by iran 's nuclear program . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " livni said after talks with german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier . germany , along with france and britain , has been at the forefront of international diplomatic efforts to stop iran enriching uranium amid fears the islamic republic is planning to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .
" then even easyjet will have to calculate anew .

opponents had argued the planned airport would cause environmental problems .
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- berlin is the no-frills capital in the no-frills airlines wave that has swept europe in recent years , no airports outside the u.k. boast more low-cost flight passengers than berlin 's three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2006 shedding light on europe 's long-lost empire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last of his kind : francis ii became austrian emperor after his abdication the holy roman empire of the german nation fell apart 200 years ago .
while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .
" then even easyjet will have to calculate anew .

opponents had argued the planned airport would cause environmental problems .
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- berlin is the no-frills capital in the no-frills airlines wave that has swept europe in recent years , no airports outside the u.k. boast more low-cost flight passengers than berlin 's three .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .

do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .

the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .

" -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "

to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .
it never wanted to expand .
it just wanted to be , what it was and remained relatively open in terms of its borders . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2006 shedding light on europe 's long-lost empire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last of his kind : francis ii became austrian emperor after his abdication the holy roman empire of the german nation fell apart 200 years ago .
while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2006 italy prepares for troop deployment in lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop carrier san giusto leaves for the lebanon carrying some of italy 's unifil force prime minister romano prodi 's government was expected to clear the deployment of 2,500 italian troops for a un peacekeeping force in lebanon late on monday . five warships are standing by to leave the italian adriatic port of taranto on tuesday to ferry the soldiers to the middle east where they will eventually form the biggest national component of an expected 15,000-strong unifil -lrb- un interim force in lebanon -rrb- . " we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .

" the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .

" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

" we will sign the decree this afternoon , " prodi told italian media monday , confirming a government decision taken 10 days ago to send the troops . on tuesday , five warships - the aircraft carrier garibaldi , three landing ships and an escort vessel - were expected to leave taranto for the lebanese port of naqura , the unifil base . the troops , comprising battle-hardened forces from italy 's iraq contingent , will be accompanied by defense minister arturo parisi and the armed forces chief general gianpaolo di paolo . italy will assume control of the international force from france in february next year , when the italian contingent is expected to reach 3,500 troops . the eu has agreed to provide 7,000 troops to the international force , half its projected strength , to help maintain a fragile ceasefire following israel 's blitz against hezbollah militants which claimed more than 1,300 lives , mostly civilian . italy to " defend and consolidate peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's unifil force prepares for deployment " we are not going to war , but we are going to lebanon to defend and consolidate peace , " foreign minister massimo d 'alema said .
" the mission could be a long one .
i hope that we will be successful in the sense that we can guarantee peace , help lebanon to rediscover unity and its full sovereignty , and reassure israel . " there may yet be a political dividend for italy .
d 'alema said on sunday that rome 's deepening diplomatic role in the middle east gave it the right to be included in nuclear negotiations with iran , currently led by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany . however the foreign ministry was forced to deny on monday that rome was involved in secret talks over a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah . hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah had said in a television interview on sunday night that " negotiations on a prisoner exchange began recently " with lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri as intermediary , and that italy and the united nations had expressed interest in being involved . " we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .
" if we succeeded , it would be the best kind of support for the unifil mission , " he told the daily la stampa . " i repeat , that iran has made known that it only trusts italy .
naturally , they also say they do not have possession of the prisoners , but could put pressure on hezbollah , " di gregorio said . meanwhile , french president jacques chirac warned on monday that fighting could resume in lebanon without a lasting settlement , as he urged iran to build the " conditions for trust " in its stand-off with the west . chirac calls for lasting peace settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac warned of a return to violence in a wide-ranging foreign policy speech , chirac urged all parties in the conflict to help secure a long-term settlement in lebanon , two weeks into a fragile ceasefire between israel and the shiite militia hezbollah . " the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel . " by promoting the necessity of settlement of holocaust survivors in the occupied palestine , they have created a constant threat in the middle east , " he said , referring to israel . chancellor rejected " totally unacceptable " letter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was not amused by the letter from iran merkel on july 21 indicated that she would not formally respond to the letter , saying it contained " totally unacceptable " criticism of israel and " constantly put in question " the jewish state 's right to exist . ahmadinejad blamed what he described as propaganda after world war ii for making " some people feel historically guilty and indefinitely pay for the crimes of their fathers . " the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media . " iranian president praised germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's holocaust conference is set for december ahmadinejad in his letter also praised the german people as a nation with potential in science , art , philosophy and politics , but " who are not allowed to play their constructive role in the world . " " undoubtedly , we , our two governments and nations , can make big steps to resolve the existing global problems ... together we can convince some powers that respecting nations ' rights is in best interest of everybody , " ahmadinejad said . the publication of the letter coincided with a visit to berlin by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , where she urged the international community to stop the " threat " posed by iran 's nuclear program . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " livni said after talks with german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier . germany , along with france and britain , has been at the forefront of international diplomatic efforts to stop iran enriching uranium amid fears the islamic republic is planning to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .
" then even easyjet will have to calculate anew .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .
the first is in the area of " graduate schools , " based on the schools ' concepts of how to promote young talent .
the second is financing for what is called " research clusters , " centers of excellence in a given field .
-lrb- a single university can apply for funding for several graduate schools and several clusters simultaneously . -rrb- schools that are awarded funding in these areas are then eligible for a third , more substantial source of funding - if they can present a dazzling vision of educational excellence for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ex-foreign minister joschka fischer has left politics - and gone to princeton it is the winners in this last category that will comprise the " elite " universities . on oct .
13 , the organizing committees will name the recipients , each of which can expect to receive around 21 million euros annually - though the amount will differ per school . next year , the whole process will take place again , resulting in the selection of another handful of super-schools , sometime in 2007 . in the end , the country hopes to establish around 10 such " elite " - or at least , better-funded - universities . prestige boost the idea , said beate konze-thomas of the german research foundation , which is organizing the selection process along with the scientific council , is for universities to make the most of their strengths . " -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .
we have universities that are older than 100 .
but we do n't seem to make the most out of them .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel .

" the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.

do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?

how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .

there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .

the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .

the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .

one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .

it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .
" then even easyjet will have to calculate anew .

opponents had argued the planned airport would cause environmental problems .

" we are referring to what foreign minister massimo d 'alema has said in the past few days , that there are no secret negotiations , " a ministry spokesman said . hezbollah 's capture of the two soldiers in a cross-border raid on july 12 triggered the massive 34-day israeli offensive in lebanon . italians open for negotiation role for his part , sergio di gregorio , chairman of the defense commission in the italian senate , left open the door to italian involvement in such negotiations .

" the choice is between a resumption of hostilities , creating a permanent rift between two neighboring peoples , and the political option of a global and lasting settlement , " he told an annual meeting of french ambassadors in paris . chirac urged israel to end its air and sea blockade of lebanon , saying the measure - intended to cut hezbollah 's supply lines - was " seriously harming " the economy .
he also called for the holding of an international conference to address the aid situation following 34 days of bloodshed . under un resolution 1701 , which ended the fighting , a robust international force is to deploy in south lebanon .
european union states have so far pledged nearly 7,000 troops , nearly half the envisaged total of 15,000 . sovereignty over all lebanon chirac said the un text provided " the framework for a lasting settlement based on israel 's security and lebanon 's sovereignty over its whole territory . " it " outlines a process which must lead to the disarmament of militias and the settlement of border questions , including that of the shebaa farms , " a disputed territory controlled by israel , chirac said . israel captured the small , mountainous territory between lebanon , syria and israel in the june 1967 middle east war , but it is now claimed by beirut with the backing of damascus . chirac appealed directly to syria - hezbollah 's key backer along with iran - to help secure a lasting peace in the region . he urged damascus to " move beyond its isolationist logic " , saying the middle east " needs syria to be active in the service of peace and regional stability .

he added that the plans would also lead to a slump in passenger numbers . berlin well served by existing airports ? irish low-budget carrier ryanair pointed out that berlin was already well served by its existing airports . " we do n't need the massive marble palace , " a ryanair spokeswoman told german newspaper b.z. am sonntag , adding that " berlin already has three lovely airports . " the argument is not new .
for years , opponents have argued that the airports tegel , tempelhof and schönefeld - the latter being the former airport of communist east berlin - are perfectly capable of meeting berlin 's aviation needs .
but others , including politicians and business leaders , have insisted that an international airport in berlin is crucial for the further economic development of the region . currently , berlin is not easily reachable with direct flights from destinations outside of europe .
often passengers need to fly through larger airports such as frankfurt , paris or london when traveling overseas . construction work on the bbi is slated to begin on sept .
5 and is estimated to cost around 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.56 million -rrb- .
the airport is scheduled to open in 2011 . experts fear financial problems the criticism by easyjet and ryanair was echoed by germany 's free-market liberal fdp party on monday . klaus-peter von lüdeke , fdp spokesperson on traffic and infrastructure said the bdi planning was excessively expensive and long-winding .
von lüdeke also pointed out that berlin 's airports had in the past years frittered away funds meant to help balance their account books , thus endangering the bbi project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport is a tourist attraction in itself according to berlin 's airports authority , the planned closure of the tempelhof airport , a nazi-era relic , alone would cost about 25 million euros .
however the 2005 business report for berlin 's airports shows that the airports ' financial reserves amount to only about 18 million euros . bbi says it caters to discount airlines the bbi however has rebuffed the criticism , saying its plans also take low-budget carriers into consideration . " bbi is already optimally geared towards traditional airlines as well as discount carriers , " burkhard kieker , the marketing head of bbi , said . kieker stressed that in the past months , the bbi had - during talks with airlines - included an own low-cost pier for discount carriers . germany 's second-biggest carrier , the low-budget airline air berlin , has said it does n't expect drastically high fees at the bbi . airline spokesman peter hauptvogel told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag that easyjet was merely trying to defend its current subsidies . in future , all airlines would have to pay the same landing fees , hauptvogel added .
" then even easyjet will have to calculate anew .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

" is it not a reasonable possibility that some countries that had won the war made up this excuse to constantly embarrass the defeated people ... to bar their progress , " ahmadinejad said in the letter . " the question is if these countries , especially britain , felt responsible for the holocaust survivors , why they did not settle them in their own countries ? " it said . it is not the first time ahmadinejad has voiced doubt about the mass slaughter of six million jews under nazi germany , previously describing the holocaust as a " myth " used to justify the creation of israel . " by promoting the necessity of settlement of holocaust survivors in the occupied palestine , they have created a constant threat in the middle east , " he said , referring to israel . chancellor rejected " totally unacceptable " letter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was not amused by the letter from iran merkel on july 21 indicated that she would not formally respond to the letter , saying it contained " totally unacceptable " criticism of israel and " constantly put in question " the jewish state 's right to exist . ahmadinejad blamed what he described as propaganda after world war ii for making " some people feel historically guilty and indefinitely pay for the crimes of their fathers . " the letter came as it emerged iran is to hold an international conference on the holocaust on december 11-12 that would allow historians to present " hidden aspects " of the nazi atrocities . media reports said the conference would touch on issues including the " reasons for anti-semitism in europe " , " the holocaust and zionism " , " the holocaust in historical documents " and " holocaust : rules and media . " iranian president praised germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's holocaust conference is set for december ahmadinejad in his letter also praised the german people as a nation with potential in science , art , philosophy and politics , but " who are not allowed to play their constructive role in the world . " " undoubtedly , we , our two governments and nations , can make big steps to resolve the existing global problems ... together we can convince some powers that respecting nations ' rights is in best interest of everybody , " ahmadinejad said . the publication of the letter coincided with a visit to berlin by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , where she urged the international community to stop the " threat " posed by iran 's nuclear program .

in the wake of the recent attempted terror attack , germany is looking for effective ways to help its citizens feel safer .
one politician has ruffled feathers with a security idea that would also ease unemployment . long-term job seekers in germany could soon be put to work patrolling local busses and trains for possible terror threats .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee suggested last week that employing long-term job-seekers in domestic anti-terror efforts might be a way to create much needed jobs and help passengers feel safer . the two-birds-with-one-stone proposal has unleashed a torrent of controversy among politicians and transportation officials . proposal met with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attack in london has made the rest of europe wary about public transportation secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- dirk niebel called the idea " populist nonsense , " while wolfgang bosbach , deputy director of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that security should be left to security officials , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . transportation and passenger associations have expressed concern about the patrols not being trained well enough to be effective . rail marshal pilot project underway tiefensee , a member of the social democratic party , defended his proposal monday . " we are looking for employment possibilities for long-term job seekers , " said tiefensee , as reported by afp .
it 's about making passengers feel safer , not about sending welfare recipients to fight terrorism or even al qaeda , he added . tiefensee said that a pilot " rail marshal " project is in the works in leipzig .
" we 'll have to see if it can then be multiplied , " he said . fellow party member ludwig stiegler , deputy chairman of the spd , was cautious in discussing the initial plan to employ the unemployed to patrol trains and busses , calling it " one of many ideas that need to be tested . " safety for public transportation passengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee : killing two birds with one stone ? more extensive video surveillance is being heatedly discussed as another domestic anti-terror technique . tiefensee 's rail marshal proposal came just several weeks after a failed terrorist attack in two german trains .
on july 31 , two bombs in suitcases were brought on to trains with the intention that they detonate simultaneously . police arrested friday the third suspect in the attempted bombing and believe a terrorist organization was behind the plan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .
the first is in the area of " graduate schools , " based on the schools ' concepts of how to promote young talent .
the second is financing for what is called " research clusters , " centers of excellence in a given field .
-lrb- a single university can apply for funding for several graduate schools and several clusters simultaneously . -rrb- schools that are awarded funding in these areas are then eligible for a third , more substantial source of funding - if they can present a dazzling vision of educational excellence for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ex-foreign minister joschka fischer has left politics - and gone to princeton it is the winners in this last category that will comprise the " elite " universities . on oct .
13 , the organizing committees will name the recipients , each of which can expect to receive around 21 million euros annually - though the amount will differ per school . next year , the whole process will take place again , resulting in the selection of another handful of super-schools , sometime in 2007 . in the end , the country hopes to establish around 10 such " elite " - or at least , better-funded - universities . prestige boost the idea , said beate konze-thomas of the german research foundation , which is organizing the selection process along with the scientific council , is for universities to make the most of their strengths . " -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .
we have universities that are older than 100 .
but we do n't seem to make the most out of them .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .
the first is in the area of " graduate schools , " based on the schools ' concepts of how to promote young talent .
the second is financing for what is called " research clusters , " centers of excellence in a given field .
-lrb- a single university can apply for funding for several graduate schools and several clusters simultaneously . -rrb- schools that are awarded funding in these areas are then eligible for a third , more substantial source of funding - if they can present a dazzling vision of educational excellence for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ex-foreign minister joschka fischer has left politics - and gone to princeton it is the winners in this last category that will comprise the " elite " universities . on oct .
13 , the organizing committees will name the recipients , each of which can expect to receive around 21 million euros annually - though the amount will differ per school . next year , the whole process will take place again , resulting in the selection of another handful of super-schools , sometime in 2007 . in the end , the country hopes to establish around 10 such " elite " - or at least , better-funded - universities . prestige boost the idea , said beate konze-thomas of the german research foundation , which is organizing the selection process along with the scientific council , is for universities to make the most of their strengths . " -lrb- they -rrb- have to ask themselves : where are our strengths ?
what can we offer that others can not ?
do we have a geographic advantage - if we are on the north sea coast , then we can specialize in marine biology . … these are things that were not previously looked at so intensively , " konze-thomas said . even more than the extra funding , the schools that make the final cut in october can expect to get a good dose of prestige . " it 's not just about the money .
it 's also the label ' excellence ' that was the point of the competition , " said konze-thomas .
but a long-term solution is needed before the idea of elite universities will really take hold , she said . " it is like with english lawns that have been watered morning and night for a hundred years .
we have universities that are older than 100 .
but we do n't seem to make the most out of them .

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .

there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .

as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.

do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "

while german museums mark the occasion , an austrian expert says that europeans would do well to look back and learn for the future . when francis ii abdicated the throne of the holy roman empire of the german nation in august 1806 , the longest-lasting political system in the german-speaking world ceased to exist .
founded by otto i almost a millennium earlier , the empire had consisted of hundreds of estates , or state-like entities .
perceived as weak by those who followed and abused by the nazis as a mythic predecessor to their own dreams of a reich that was meant to last a thousand years , the positive aspects of the holy roman empire have only been illuminated in recent decades .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the end of the empire , numerous german museums are offering special exhibitions on the empire .
on monday , the most ambitious endeavor , a joint exhibition of the museum of cultural history in magdeburg and the german historical museum in berlin , will open its doors to the public .
to find out more about the empire 's importance for germany 's history and any lessons the european union could draw from it , dw-world.de spoke with brigitte mazohl-wallnig , the director of the history department at innsbruck university .
she is the author of " turn of an era 1806 : the holy roman empire and the birth of modern europe . "
dw-world.de : why should people still care about the holy roma n empire today ? brigitte mazohl-wallnig : the holy roman empire is the foundation of our common european history .
it should be anchored much more strongly in the collective memory of all europeans than is currently the case .
it can help to remove the filter of the " nation state " that we 're used to employ when looking at history . ca n o n e really speak of a n empire ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the empire 's parliament met in regensburg 's old town hall from 1663 to 1806 i think that it was an empire , which clearly identified itself as such and was perceived as such .
there were common basic laws , which indeed formed something akin to a basic constitution .
there was the imperial parliament , two imperial courts of justice and imperial districts .
there was the emperor , as the guarantor of this order and a superior entity , which - n ota be n e - was not absolutist .
the system was a dual one .
the emperor basically could not decide without the imperial parliament . why did the empire eve n tually fall apart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british cartoon showed napoleon as the " great french gingerbread baker , " who produces new german kings during the 18th century , the individual estates , especially the larger ones , increasingly drew on the absolutist model and engaged in internal and external power politics .
the decisive death blow came during the napoleonic wars , when it became obvious that prussia and austria were no longer focused on the common interests .
as a result , the southern german estates followed suit and made arrangements with napoleon .
they became autonomous , sovereign states . how did the abse n ce of a n atio n state i n flue n ce germa n y 's history later o n ? it did n't only influence germany , but all central europe , including italy , austria and eastern european countries .
the fall of the empire created a vacuum in the middle of europe , which was filled with italian and german nationalism - with all the consequences that this had for world war i.
-lrb- austrian playwright franz -rrb- grillparzer already predicted at the time : " from humanitarianism to nationalism to beastliness . " some of your colleagues thi n k that the third reich clouded the view of the holy roma n empire -lrb- reich -rrb- .
do you agree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler selectively used the holy roman empire to his advantage definitely .
the word " reich " alone has become offensive since then .
as a historian , i think that the propaganda of the 19th century was even worse .
there was a flood of insults .
everything the 19th century had dreamt about , namely a strong state , was not characteristic of the reich .
that 's why people only said negative things about it . are there aspects of the empire that the moder n e n tity europea n u n io n could adopt ? let me exaggerate a little : it 's almost as if the eu picks up where things left off in 1806 .
similar questions to those that were asked backed then have to be asked again : what responsibilities lie with the supra-structure , the community ?
what responsibilities remain at the lower level , with individual states ?
how are the smaller ones represented in relation to the bigger ones ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still hard to grapple under today 's democratic conditions , we are faced with similar questions that were answered back then after centuries of controversy .
one can learn from this that europe definitely needs a common basic law and a common constitution , which can be accepted by everyone .
the empire 's basic laws were broad enough to be supported by everyone and still tight enough to serve as a sufficient , common band .
the empire also had a strong political symbolism .
it knew how to make itself seen .
europe is n't as visible .
it has n't really developed a common european symbolism . what could it look like ? the empire failed because it no longer had a common defense and foreign policy .
one should really think about whether a community does n't need a convincing , common foreign policy .
and if europe remembers the empire 's peace order , it could score this way : " we are a european peace order and we do n't go along with global militarization and the like . "
the empire never lay claim to hegemony .

in january , the field was narrowed to 10 finalists ; this autumn will see a final selection . until recently , the term " elite " university had a negative connotation in germany , a country which prided itself on offering its citizens a higher education that was egalitarian and free of charge . but that notion is beginning to change .
the country 's star as an important center for scientific research has been fading for more than a decade , with academics fleeing chronically underfinanced universities for better paid positions overseas .
the media regularly warn of a scientific brain drain . germany 's answer ?
the " excellence initiative , " a plan to create a cadre of elite universities that will receive a boost in state and federal funding amounting to 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- over the next five years . a german harvard ? the aim is to polish germany 's reputation for academics , and bring some of its top universities into competition with well known us and uk elites , like harvard and oxford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will elite universities have better library facilities ?
the folks behind the project are hoping for nothing less than to bring about a paradigm shift in how germans regard higher education .
" the idea behind the program is to make clear that there is already inequality in the german university system , " said sabine behrenbeck of germany 's scientific council , a german accreditation body and one of the organizations in charge of the " excellence initiative " selection process . she defended the concept , which is frequently criticized as being too elitist , saying : " all german universities are not equally good .
there has already been a differentiation .
now that should be made transparent , and it should also be encouraged . " narrowing the field ten universities have already made it through a pre-selection process . they will now compete for funding in three areas , or pillars .

experts already know obesity ups the risk of developing some cancers , but this study suggests fat tissue might also affect how a tumour progresses .
the authors believe fat cells excrete a hormone or protein that makes ovarian cancer cells grow more aggressively .
the cedars-sinai medical center research appears in the journal cancer .
aggressive tumours lead researcher dr andrew li said : " this study is the first to identify weight as an independent factor in ovarian cancer in disease progression and overall survival , suggesting that there is an element in the fat tissue itself that influences the outcome of this disease in obese women . "
the researchers looked at the disease course of 216 women with epithelial ovarian cancer - the most common type of ovarian tumours , accounting for 90 % of cases .
comparison of the 35 women who were obese with the 108 women who were an ideal weight revealed significant differences in cancer outcomes .
obesity influenced survival rates , shortened the length of time that the cancer recurred after treatment and led to earlier death from the cancer . "
further research is needed to confirm if obesity can affect ovarian cancer progression " dr laura-jane armstrong , cancer information officer at cancer research uk dr li said the next step would be to examine exactly how fat might influence tumour growth .
other studies have found a compound called insulin-like growth factor 1 -lrb- igf-1 -rrb- is more highly expressed in obese people than those who are slimmer and igf-1 correlates with increased breast cancer risk in women .
also , a binding protein for igf , called igfbp-2 , seems to promote invasion in ovarian cancer .
around 6,800 women are diagnosed with cancer of the ovary every year in the uk .
it can occur at any age , but is most common after the menopause .
ovarian cancers are difficult to diagnose .
most women will be diagnosed with late disease and about 70 % die within five years of being diagnosed , making it one of the most lethal cancers .
dr laura-jane armstrong , cancer information officer at cancer research uk , said : " obesity increases the risk of cancer of the bowel , womb , gall bladder and oesophagus cancer , and of breast cancer in post-menopausal women so it is plausible that it could also increase a woman 's risk of ovarian cancer .
" indeed , several previous studies suggested this may be the case .
" however , this current study involved a relatively small number of patients so further research is needed to confirm if obesity can affect ovarian cancer progression .
" maintaining a healthy weight is one of the best ways to reduce the chances of getting cancer . "

the researchers looked at the disease course of 216 women with epithelial ovarian cancer - the most common type of ovarian tumours , accounting for 90 % of cases .
comparison of the 35 women who were obese with the 108 women who were an ideal weight revealed significant differences in cancer outcomes .
obesity influenced survival rates , shortened the length of time that the cancer recurred after treatment and led to earlier death from the cancer .
further research is needed to confirm if obesity can affect ovarian cancer progression dr laura-jane armstrong , cancer information officer at cancer research uk dr li said the next step would be to examine exactly how fat might influence tumour growth .
other studies have found a compound called insulin-like growth factor 1 -lrb- igf-1 -rrb- is more highly expressed in obese people than those who are slimmer and igf-1 correlates with increased breast cancer risk in women .
also , a binding protein for igf , called igfbp-2 , seems to promote invasion in ovarian cancer .
around 6,800 women are diagnosed with cancer of the ovary every year in the uk .
it can occur at any age , but is most common after the menopause .
ovarian cancers are difficult to diagnose .
most women will be diagnosed with late disease and about 70 % die within five years of being diagnosed , making it one of the most lethal cancers .
dr laura-jane armstrong , cancer information officer at cancer research uk , said : " obesity increases the risk of cancer of the bowel , womb , gall bladder and oesophagus cancer , and of breast cancer in post-menopausal women so it is plausible that it could also increase a woman 's risk of ovarian cancer .
" indeed , several previous studies suggested this may be the case .
" however , this current study involved a relatively small number of patients so further research is needed to confirm if obesity can affect ovarian cancer progression .
" maintaining a healthy weight is one of the best ways to reduce the chances of getting cancer . "

the comair crj-100 jet , bound for atlanta , went down in woods about a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- from lexington 's airport at about 0610 -lrb- 1010 gmt -rrb- on sunday .
investigators said the plane took off from the wrong runway , a short strip not intended for commercial flights .
the sole survivor , co-pilot james polehinke , is in critical condition .
flight 5191 took off from a 3,500ft -lrb- 1,050-metre -rrb- runway instead of the 7,000ft -lrb- 2,100-metre -rrb- runway which it should have used .
a plane of this type needs at least 4,500 feet -lrb- 1,350 metres -rrb- to get fully airborne , experts say .
this is the worst us air accident since november 2001 , when an american airlines plane crashed in queens , new york , shortly after takeoff from jfk airport , killing 265 people black boxes the plane 's " black boxes " - its flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - have both been retrieved and sent to washington dc for analysis .
peter goelz , former managing director of the national transportation safety board , said analysts would be trying to determine how the passengers perished : by blunt force trauma , smoke inhalation or burn .
" they 'll try and figure out from the position of the victims whether an evacuation was possible , " he said .
" from the location of the bodies , they may be able to tell whether an evacuation was attempted . "
mr goelz added that questions would be asked about the emergency response : " how quickly did they get there ?
did they have the appropriate firefighting materials ?
did they put the right stuff on in a timely manner ? "
clearance question there were marks at the end of the shorter runway 26 apparently made by the plane , said debbie hersman , who is heading the ntsb inquiry into the case .
however , investigators are still trying to ascertain whether the plane had been cleared for takeoff on the longer runway 22 .

the comair crj-100 jet , bound for atlanta , went down in woods about a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- from lexington 's airport at about 0610 -lrb- 1010 gmt -rrb- on sunday .
investigators said the plane took off from the wrong runway , a short strip not intended for commercial flights .
the sole survivor , co-pilot james polehinke , is in critical condition .
flight 5191 took off from a 3,500ft -lrb- 1,050-metre -rrb- runway instead of the 7,000ft -lrb- 2,100-metre -rrb- runway which it should have used .
a plane of this type needs at least 4,500 feet -lrb- 1,350 metres -rrb- to get fully airborne , experts say .

the " black boxes " have been retrieved and sent for analysis peter goelz , former managing director of the national transportation safety board , said analysts would be trying to determine how the passengers perished : by blunt force trauma , smoke inhalation or burn .
" they 'll try and figure out from the position of the victims whether an evacuation was possible , " he said .
" from the location of the bodies , they may be able to tell whether an evacuation was attempted . "
mr goelz added that questions would be asked about the emergency response : " how quickly did they get there ?
did they have the appropriate firefighting materials ?
did they put the right stuff on in a timely manner ? "
clearance question there were marks at the end of the shorter runway 26 apparently made by the plane , said debbie hersman , who is heading the ntsb inquiry into the case .

figures from the student loans company -lrb- slc -rrb- showed 677 borrowers declared bankruptcy in 2005 - down from the all-time high of 811 the previous year .
but the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- said the figure was still too high and reinforced the case for grants .
the scottish executive said student loans were repayable on affordable terms , with amounts linked to income .
last month , the snp 's deputy leader , nicola sturgeon , announced plans for £ 100m funding package to help eliminate debts and reintroduce student grants . "
moving to grants rather than loans would not make sense " scottish executive on monday , the party will use the figures on bankruptcy to say its case has been strengthened .
a party spokesman said : " these figures reinforce the need to end tuition fees for students .
it 's now the case that students finish their studies with an average of £ 11,000 of debt around their necks .

the shipbuilding town on the isolated furness peninsula in south-west cumbria is home to 3,200 steelworkers , designers , engineers , fitters , electricians and other skilled workers building some of the royal navy 's most secretive and deadly weapons .
hms astute , hms ambush and hms artful are a new class of nuclear attack submarines being built at bae systems submarines ' 169 acre site .
astute , the first in her class , is almost complete .
she is being fitted out in the cavernous devonshire dock hall , the largest construction complex of its type in europe .
" fitting out " means packing astute 's 97 metre-long pressurised hull with a nuclear reactor , four giant turbines , 100km of cabling , 10km of pipe work - more than one million components in total .
once deployed , she will displace 7,800 tonnes of sea water and withstand pressure equivalent to 400 family saloon cars weighing down on every square metre of surface area .
the pressurised water reactor is designed to create enough steam to keep her turbines powered throughout her lifespan of more than a quarter of a century .
the reactor creates enough energy to power a city the size of southampton , with the submarine 's commander sleeping less than 10 metres away from its core .
oxygen from sea water astute will create her own oxygen and fresh water from seawater and will be armed with spearfish torpedoes and tomahawk cruise missiles capable of hitting a target 2,000km inland .
unsurprisingly for an engineering project described as " more complex than the space shuttle " , it has not run totally according to plan .
the devonshire dock hall dominates the barrow skyline five years ago things were looking bleak .
" the astute business was in trouble , " says bae 's chris nelson .
" the submarine was £ 900m over budget and running four years late .
" the relationship with the ministry of defence had deteriorated so badly that they were not going to give bae another contract to build a surface ship . "
us help the recovery started in 2003 with the arrival of murray easton , bae systems submarines ' tenth managing director in as many years .
the contract with the mod was renegotiated and a new bonus scheme was introduced for all non-executive staff .
this provided an extra £ 1,600 per employee in 2005 , with a further bonus due on completion of the project .
easton called in business psychologists to lift morale and repair the poor relations between management and staff .
he also realised that the yard would need help from farther afield .
the last submarine completed before astute was laid down in 1993 , and a series of redundancies in the intervening years had stripped the company of many of its most skilled engineers and designers .
so bae brought in a team of experts from its us submarine counterpart electric boat .
their arrival saw a number of major innovations in the building process - not least " modular construction " and " vertical outfitting " .
submarines are our bread and butter , they are our " niche " market councillor terry waiting , barrow borough council areas of the astute submarines like the command deck and forward engine room are now divided into modules , which are assembled in the workshop .
they are then taken to the devonshire dock hall where they are carefully placed within the hull .
ahead of schedule this process was improved further with vertical outfitting , where modules can be dropped into place using overhead cranes and the improved 360 degree access makes it easier to install the complicated cable and pipe work .
it is estimated that these new processes cut 500,000 man hours from the build time for each of the first two submarines .
electric boat 's techniques were also used to introduce visualisation software that gave workers a 3d image of the whole submarine - a virtual version of the wooden scale models that were used previously .
when , as planned , hms astute is unveiled on 8 june next year she will be seven weeks ahead of her revised schedule .
submarines have been built in barrow for 120 years in pictures although she will have cost an estimated £ 3.4bn , bae hopes to be able to build the next two astute class submarine 's for less than £ 1bn each - although it has yet to agree the bill with the mod .
the company is currently negotiating with the mod for a contract to build another four astute class submarines .
bae has already been given the all clear to buy some of the special submarine steel that would be needed for the new boats .
and the company is hopeful of winning a contract to build the central hull of two new royal navy aircraft carriers - the cvf " future carrier " .
but the big prize for bae , and barrow , is trident .
boom town barrow jobs and money flooded into barrow in the 1980s when the yard , then owned by vickers , designed and built britain 's fleet of four vanguard-class trident nuclear missile carrying submarines .
in june , chancellor gordon brown pledged to replace the trident nuclear missile system .
the vanguard class submarines are scheduled to be phased out in the 2020s - and most barrovians are hoping that the new trident platform will again be submarine based , and built in the town .
whether it would take the form of a new class of submarine , or an adapted version of the astute class is a hotly debated topic within the press .
a decision could be imminent , because design work for a new range of trident submarines would have to start within the next couple of years in order to have a replacement ready in time .
according to local community leaders , barrow without submarine building just does n't bear thinking about .
it is estimated that in wages alone , bae pumps over £ 70m per year into the local economy .
" if submarine building finished in barrow it would be a devastating economic blow as it would most certainly lead to the end of shipbuilding in the town , " says councillor terry waiting , leader of barrow borough council and chairman of the keep our future afloat campaign , which promotes the use of the north west 's naval shipyards .

she is being fitted out in the cavernous devonshire dock hall , the largest construction complex of its type in europe .
" fitting out " means packing astute 's 97 metre-long pressurised hull with a nuclear reactor , four giant turbines , 100km of cabling , 10km of pipe work - more than one million components in total .
once deployed , she will displace 7,800 tonnes of sea water and withstand pressure equivalent to 400 family saloon cars weighing down on every square metre of surface area .
the pressurised water reactor is designed to create enough steam to keep her turbines powered throughout her lifespan of more than a quarter of a century .
the reactor creates enough energy to power a city the size of southampton , with the submarine 's commander sleeping less than 10 metres away from its core .
oxygen from sea water astute will create her own oxygen and fresh water from seawater and will be armed with spearfish torpedoes and tomahawk cruise missiles capable of hitting a target 2,000km inland .
unsurprisingly for an engineering project described as " more complex than the space shuttle " , it has not run totally according to plan .
the devonshire dock hall dominates the barrow skyline five years ago things were looking bleak .
" the astute business was in trouble , " says bae 's chris nelson .
" the submarine was £ 900m over budget and running four years late .
" the relationship with the ministry of defence had deteriorated so badly that they were not going to give bae another contract to build a surface ship . "
us help the recovery started in 2003 with the arrival of murray easton , bae systems submarines ' tenth managing director in as many years .
the contract with the mod was renegotiated and a new bonus scheme was introduced for all non-executive staff .
this provided an extra £ 1,600 per employee in 2005 , with a further bonus due on completion of the project .
easton called in business psychologists to lift morale and repair the poor relations between management and staff .
he also realised that the yard would need help from farther afield .
the last submarine completed before astute was laid down in 1993 , and a series of redundancies in the intervening years had stripped the company of many of its most skilled engineers and designers .
so bae brought in a team of experts from its us submarine counterpart electric boat .
their arrival saw a number of major innovations in the building process - not least " modular construction " and " vertical outfitting " .
submarines are our bread and butter , they are our " niche " market councillor terry waiting , barrow borough council areas of the astute submarines like the command deck and forward engine room are now divided into modules , which are assembled in the workshop .
they are then taken to the devonshire dock hall where they are carefully placed within the hull .
ahead of schedule this process was improved further with vertical outfitting , where modules can be dropped into place using overhead cranes and the improved 360 degree access makes it easier to install the complicated cable and pipe work .
it is estimated that these new processes cut 500,000 man hours from the build time for each of the first two submarines .
electric boat 's techniques were also used to introduce visualisation software that gave workers a 3d image of the whole submarine - a virtual version of the wooden scale models that were used previously .
when , as planned , hms astute is unveiled on 8 june next year she will be seven weeks ahead of her revised schedule .
submarines have been built in barrow for 120 years in pictures although she will have cost an estimated £ 3.4bn , bae hopes to be able to build the next two astute class submarine 's for less than £ 1bn each - although it has yet to agree the bill with the mod .
the company is currently negotiating with the mod for a contract to build another four astute class submarines .
bae has already been given the all clear to buy some of the special submarine steel that would be needed for the new boats .
and the company is hopeful of winning a contract to build the central hull of two new royal navy aircraft carriers - the cvf " future carrier " .
but the big prize for bae , and barrow , is trident .
boom town barrow jobs and money flooded into barrow in the 1980s when the yard , then owned by vickers , designed and built britain 's fleet of four vanguard-class trident nuclear missile carrying submarines .
in june , chancellor gordon brown pledged to replace the trident nuclear missile system .
the vanguard class submarines are scheduled to be phased out in the 2020s - and most barrovians are hoping that the new trident platform will again be submarine based , and built in the town .
whether it would take the form of a new class of submarine , or an adapted version of the astute class is a hotly debated topic within the press .
a decision could be imminent , because design work for a new range of trident submarines would have to start within the next couple of years in order to have a replacement ready in time .
according to local community leaders , barrow without submarine building just does n't bear thinking about .
it is estimated that in wages alone , bae pumps over £ 70m per year into the local economy .
" if submarine building finished in barrow it would be a devastating economic blow as it would most certainly lead to the end of shipbuilding in the town , " says councillor terry waiting , leader of barrow borough council and chairman of the keep our future afloat campaign , which promotes the use of the north west 's naval shipyards .
" submarines are our bread and butter , they are our " niche " market . "

the mass events , which draw hundreds of single men and women , have climbed in popularity since they were introduced in chinese cities .
one event in zhejiang in april attracted 12,658 participants , xinhua news agency said , while 10,000 showed up for another in shanghai .
the events appeal to china 's new ranks of urban educated professionals .
cities are full of young workers , but singletons who spend long hours at the office end up with no time to meet other people , said wu xiuping of the beijing municipal women 's federation .
the federation has been organising sessions in the capital for three years , xinhua said , bringing more than 300 couples together .
at the dating events , men and women are put into groups to get to know each other and , if they want to , can swap telephone numbers at the end .
ms wu said group dating was particularly popular with women .
" women have to study and work harder to succeed in society , therefore many girls have missed the best time for husband hunting , " she said .
one participant , hu liu , fell into that category .
" i am at the age to seriously think of marriage , but it 's hard for me to meet and get to know guys , " she said .
ms hu did not really expect to meet a potential spouse , but there were other benefits , she said .
" at least i can make some female friends who are like me . "

the federation has been organising sessions in the capital for three years , xinhua said , bringing more than 300 couples together .
at the dating events , men and women are put into groups to get to know each other and , if they want to , can swap telephone numbers at the end .
ms wu said group dating was particularly popular with women .
" women have to study and work harder to succeed in society , therefore many girls have missed the best time for husband hunting , " she said .
one participant , hu liu , fell into that category .
" i am at the age to seriously think of marriage , but it 's hard for me to meet and get to know guys , " she said .
ms hu did not really expect to meet a potential spouse , but there were other benefits , she said .
" at least i can make some female friends who are like me . "
