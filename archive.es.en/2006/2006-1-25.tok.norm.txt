" we must believe that our country can live better from its ideas , " she said in remarks which reprised many of the themes she used in her successful drive toward the chancellery last year . faced with an increasingly competitive world , she added , " we have no choice but this urgency to change . " merkel was the keynote speaker at the first day of the annual gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss ski resort of davos . bringing germany back executives were keen to hear her strategy of how to lead germany out of its economic malaise , crippled by low growth - 1.5 percent is predicted for this year - and unemployment that in december stood at more than 11 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have no choice but this urgency to change . "
" we are as if paralyzed by events , and do not seem to be able to overcome them , " she said in her half-hour speech . " something has to be done .
we as the biggest economy in europe must assume our responsibilities in europe .
we have to do it in our own particular way . " it meant sweeping reforms on tax and the budgetary system , reducing labour costs , revamping germany 's federal structure " in order to improve and expedite decision-making " and creating long-term stability to attract investors . citing " terrifyingly high unemployment " across europe , she added : " we have to make sure the political world intervenes at the right points and withdraws when it 's appropriate . " bureaucracy often stifled innovation , she said .
" we must get away from the idea that a directive is for all time . " trade merkel pledged that germany would do all it could to push stuttering talks on liberalising trade . negotiators failed to make substantial progress at world trade organisation talks last month in hong kong amid persistent rifts over the scope and pace of liberalization in the agriculture , services and industrial goods sectors . " we saw what happened in hong kong , " merkel went on .
" we must continue our efforts so that that does not happen again .
we will do what we can so that the wto becomes a major guarantor of international agreements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2006 german business confidence rises to five-year high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after years of drought , germany is beginning to prosper again business confidence in germany rose to the highest level in more than five-and-a-half years in january , a key survey showed wednesday .
the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?
" from gloom to boom in less than a year , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" german business leaders , who were still ridden by ' angst ' last spring , now seem to be almost dancing in the streets . " reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .
in berlin , economy minister michael glos upgraded berlin 's growth forecast for the current year to 1.4 percent .
glos even boldly claimed that growth could even come out as high as two percent , double the 0.9 percent recorded last year . for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are bringing out the champagne " companies are a lot more satisfied with current business than they were in december , " ifo chief sinn said .
" and they 're a great deal more confident about the outlook for the next six months . " eco n omic spri n g i n the air the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy has been brightening for some time , nurtured by a raft of positive real economic data .
earlier this month , investor confidence , as measured by the monthly economic expectations index calculated by fellow think-tank zew , topped a two-year high point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery is picking up speed " there is a definite sense of economic spring in the air in germany .
german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .

" however , he promised that any deficit-cutting recommendations from the commission would not threaten a growing recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia will decide if germany faces sanctions next month " that 's a necessity not just in germany but also for the rest of the euro area , " he said . germany - the eu 's largest economy - has failed for four years to keep its budget deficit under the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product .
it is still not clear if the eu will place germany in the " excessive deficit procedure " status or give the country more time to let its new government trim public spending .
if it does n't , germany may have to pay billions in fines or face tighter eu scrutiny and controls on its budgets . optimistic ahead of a meeting with euro-zone finance ministers , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he was confident the commission would agree not to press ahead with disciplinary measures against berlin because of the deficit . he said he was " optimistic about the possibility of an agreement with the commission " and that " we have no interest for an escalation " in tensions . luxembourg prime ministers jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro-zone finance ministers , said they were " satisfied " with berlin 's deficit cutting efforts . " we are rather satisfied with our image of the german finances , " he told reporters as he arrived for the meeting . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" more than three-quarters of people expect hooliganism in the 12 cities where the matches will be played while two-thirds believe fans will clash with police in the stadiums , according to a poll carried out by the tns emnid institute . such fears are not unfounded - the most recent world cup played in europe , the 1998 tournament in france , was scarred by brawling english fans and an attack by german skinheads which left a french policeman physically and mentally disabled . the last finals , in japan and south korea in 2002 , were trouble-free , but most observers attributed that to the fact they were staged far from the traditional european " centers " of hooliganism , such as england and the netherlands . high-risk factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer is often cheaper than soft drinks in germany the wide availability of cheap beer in germany , the fact that the country is served by cheap flights from all over europe and its many shared borders make the 2006 tournament potentially high-risk . yet michael endler , a high-ranking german police officer and an expert on hooligans from the office of criminal investigation in the western city of düsseldorf , said there was no reason to panic . " not every supporter brandishing a country 's flag and holding a glass of beer is going to commit violence , " endler said . endler and his staff from the central sport information unit -lrb- zis -rrb- will play a key role during the finals . gatheri n g i n tellige n ce they say the key to preventing violence is intelligence-gathering . " during the world cup , we will process between 800 and 1,000 pieces of information from germany and abroad , " endler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will monitor activities inside the stadiums and keep an eye on potential hooligans outside data will be collected centrally and then sent to the police forces in the 16 federal states ahead of each of the 64 matches to allow security arrangements to be planned locally . " beyond that there will be officers who know the scene from germany and abroad reporting on the situation in the stadiums , " endler said . the unit will swell from its current size of 17 members of staff to around 150 in may and will move to neuss near düsseldorf in time for the june 9 kickoff . endler 's unit was created in 1992 to observe the hooligan scene in germany because most of the main professional clubs in the country are based in that region .
it began working in collaboration with its counterparts abroad for the 2002 world cup in asia and the euro 2004 finals in portugal . i n ter n atio n al cooperatio n diplomatically , endler refused to be drawn on which countries ' fans were considered high-risk . " wherever we have the potential for violence , we will be informed by the participating countries shortly before the start of the world cup , " he said .
" we will then concentrate on those people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans have been stocking up on german-style wwii helmets in the dutch signature color orange that say : " go holland , go ! "
traditionally , the risk of trouble has come from english , dutch and german fans , yet recent reports from poland suggest a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there , a worrying development considering poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . the danger of trouble at the world 's biggest sporting event is considerable - in germany alone , the police believe around 10,000 football fans are prone to violence . viole n ce outside stadiums the union of german police officers meanwhile has warned that many fans from germany and abroad will seek to pick fights in the host cities , but often far from the stadiums . bildunterschrift : frankfurt is planning to show games on a giant screen floating in the city 's main river the 236 giant television screens to be erected around the country , known as public viewing sites , to allow non-ticketholders to see matches are considered possible flashpoints . " i know of no precedent in which there have been so many public viewing sites , " endler said . nevertheless , he said he was confident that the football would not be overshadowed by fighting fans . " i can think of no scenario which would give me sleepless nights .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?

solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .

" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .

and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 merkel to open davos economy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world economic forum is getting underway again in davos german chancellor angela merkel will give the opening speech , on the topic of european integration , at the world economic forum in davos wednesday . the swiss alpine ski resort of davos is hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum , one of the globe ’ s most high-profile economic events and usually a prime target for anti-globalization campaigners . there won ’ t be as many state and government leaders present at the forum this year , but one of the highlights of the five-day event will be the opening address by germany 's recently elected chancellor .
merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .
it should n't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case . w. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future : he faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office , which could send him to prison for up to five years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter weather is snow joke for christmas criminals two thieves who went on a christmas crime wave were arrested after their footprints in the fresh snow led the cops from the scene of the crime to the front door of the criminals ' abode .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen if hamas is victorious ?
radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

" i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

" more than three-quarters of people expect hooliganism in the 12 cities where the matches will be played while two-thirds believe fans will clash with police in the stadiums , according to a poll carried out by the tns emnid institute . such fears are not unfounded - the most recent world cup played in europe , the 1998 tournament in france , was scarred by brawling english fans and an attack by german skinheads which left a french policeman physically and mentally disabled . the last finals , in japan and south korea in 2002 , were trouble-free , but most observers attributed that to the fact they were staged far from the traditional european " centers " of hooliganism , such as england and the netherlands . high-risk factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer is often cheaper than soft drinks in germany the wide availability of cheap beer in germany , the fact that the country is served by cheap flights from all over europe and its many shared borders make the 2006 tournament potentially high-risk . yet michael endler , a high-ranking german police officer and an expert on hooligans from the office of criminal investigation in the western city of düsseldorf , said there was no reason to panic . " not every supporter brandishing a country 's flag and holding a glass of beer is going to commit violence , " endler said . endler and his staff from the central sport information unit -lrb- zis -rrb- will play a key role during the finals . gatheri n g i n tellige n ce they say the key to preventing violence is intelligence-gathering .

" more than three-quarters of people expect hooliganism in the 12 cities where the matches will be played while two-thirds believe fans will clash with police in the stadiums , according to a poll carried out by the tns emnid institute . such fears are not unfounded - the most recent world cup played in europe , the 1998 tournament in france , was scarred by brawling english fans and an attack by german skinheads which left a french policeman physically and mentally disabled . the last finals , in japan and south korea in 2002 , were trouble-free , but most observers attributed that to the fact they were staged far from the traditional european " centers " of hooliganism , such as england and the netherlands . high-risk factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer is often cheaper than soft drinks in germany the wide availability of cheap beer in germany , the fact that the country is served by cheap flights from all over europe and its many shared borders make the 2006 tournament potentially high-risk . yet michael endler , a high-ranking german police officer and an expert on hooligans from the office of criminal investigation in the western city of düsseldorf , said there was no reason to panic . " not every supporter brandishing a country 's flag and holding a glass of beer is going to commit violence , " endler said . endler and his staff from the central sport information unit -lrb- zis -rrb- will play a key role during the finals . gatheri n g i n tellige n ce they say the key to preventing violence is intelligence-gathering .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin is much in demand as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action . the bluster coming out of tehran of late has put western capitals on edge of late . the eu 3 - great britain , france and germany - appear ready to abandon further diplomatic efforts at halting iran 's uranium-enrichment plans in favor of possible sanctions through the un security council .
but sanctions are the last thing on the mind of some security council members , notably russia . prime minister vladimir putin has in the past wanted to protect iran , an important trading and energy partner .
but even moscow seems frustrated at tehran 's increasing hard line , say experts , and will assume a key position in the crisis talks of the coming weeks . iran 's affront to europe " if russia puts itself clearly on the western side of this equation , then iran runs the danger of isolating itself , " said oliver thränert , an iran expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has stepped up the rhetoric , and does n't seem concerned isolation has n't seemed to bother iran up until now .
after meeting with eu negotiators at the beginning in october 2003 , tehran rejected outright a package of incentives presented by eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the fall of 2005 designed to stop the enrichment of uranium at iranian nuclear facilities .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb . on jan .
10 , iran began uranium-enrichment activities at several nuclear facilities , the ultimate affront to european negotiators .
the eu-3 soon joined washington in calling for the matter to be taken up by the security council . missing a military threat at an emergency meeting of the board of governors of the international atomic and energy agency in vienna on feb .
2 , the eu-3 and the us will be looking to convince russia and council member china to come down harder on tehran .
the two holdouts on the five-member security council could veto any sanctions proposal . " if russia does n't move , then it 's 3-2 -lrb- votes in the un security council -rrb- , and that 's a very comfortable situation for iran , " said thränert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan is cause for concern a defeat of the sanctions proposal in the un security council would only encourage tehran , say experts , especially without a visible military threat from the west .
though washington has repeatedly said it will take no option off of the table , tehran seems emboldened by america 's difficulties in iraq and afghanistan . " they seem pretty confident that there wo n't be a military threat from the west , " said frank umbach , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" and that is the west 's dilemma , something mohammed elbaradei has also mentioned in recent weeks . " merkel lobbying russia without the threat of military action or sanctions , the eu and washington 's main hope remains convincing russia .
and moscow has given them reason for optimism in recent days .
a moscow proposal foresees russia and tehran jointly enriching uranium in russia .
the plan , which has interested iran , could provide the west more oversight over iranian nuclear activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , and china , may be the keys to resolving the issue germany could play an important role in lobbying putin 's support .
of the eu-3 , germany still has the best ties to moscow , said thränert . " we can also build a bridge to russia , " he said .
" merkel wo n't be able to do it herself , but our relationship to moscow is still better than that of the french and british .

" however , he promised that any deficit-cutting recommendations from the commission would not threaten a growing recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia will decide if germany faces sanctions next month " that 's a necessity not just in germany but also for the rest of the euro area , " he said . germany - the eu 's largest economy - has failed for four years to keep its budget deficit under the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product .
it is still not clear if the eu will place germany in the " excessive deficit procedure " status or give the country more time to let its new government trim public spending .
if it does n't , germany may have to pay billions in fines or face tighter eu scrutiny and controls on its budgets . optimistic ahead of a meeting with euro-zone finance ministers , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he was confident the commission would agree not to press ahead with disciplinary measures against berlin because of the deficit . he said he was " optimistic about the possibility of an agreement with the commission " and that " we have no interest for an escalation " in tensions . luxembourg prime ministers jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro-zone finance ministers , said they were " satisfied " with berlin 's deficit cutting efforts .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin is much in demand as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action . the bluster coming out of tehran of late has put western capitals on edge of late . the eu 3 - great britain , france and germany - appear ready to abandon further diplomatic efforts at halting iran 's uranium-enrichment plans in favor of possible sanctions through the un security council .
but sanctions are the last thing on the mind of some security council members , notably russia . prime minister vladimir putin has in the past wanted to protect iran , an important trading and energy partner .
but even moscow seems frustrated at tehran 's increasing hard line , say experts , and will assume a key position in the crisis talks of the coming weeks . iran 's affront to europe " if russia puts itself clearly on the western side of this equation , then iran runs the danger of isolating itself , " said oliver thränert , an iran expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has stepped up the rhetoric , and does n't seem concerned isolation has n't seemed to bother iran up until now .
after meeting with eu negotiators at the beginning in october 2003 , tehran rejected outright a package of incentives presented by eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the fall of 2005 designed to stop the enrichment of uranium at iranian nuclear facilities .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb . on jan .
10 , iran began uranium-enrichment activities at several nuclear facilities , the ultimate affront to european negotiators .
the eu-3 soon joined washington in calling for the matter to be taken up by the security council . missing a military threat at an emergency meeting of the board of governors of the international atomic and energy agency in vienna on feb .
2 , the eu-3 and the us will be looking to convince russia and council member china to come down harder on tehran .
the two holdouts on the five-member security council could veto any sanctions proposal . " if russia does n't move , then it 's 3-2 -lrb- votes in the un security council -rrb- , and that 's a very comfortable situation for iran , " said thränert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan is cause for concern a defeat of the sanctions proposal in the un security council would only encourage tehran , say experts , especially without a visible military threat from the west .
though washington has repeatedly said it will take no option off of the table , tehran seems emboldened by america 's difficulties in iraq and afghanistan . " they seem pretty confident that there wo n't be a military threat from the west , " said frank umbach , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" and that is the west 's dilemma , something mohammed elbaradei has also mentioned in recent weeks . " merkel lobbying russia without the threat of military action or sanctions , the eu and washington 's main hope remains convincing russia .
and moscow has given them reason for optimism in recent days .
a moscow proposal foresees russia and tehran jointly enriching uranium in russia .
the plan , which has interested iran , could provide the west more oversight over iranian nuclear activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , and china , may be the keys to resolving the issue germany could play an important role in lobbying putin 's support .
of the eu-3 , germany still has the best ties to moscow , said thränert . " we can also build a bridge to russia , " he said .
" merkel wo n't be able to do it herself , but our relationship to moscow is still better than that of the french and british .

the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?
" from gloom to boom in less than a year , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" german business leaders , who were still ridden by ' angst ' last spring , now seem to be almost dancing in the streets . " reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .
in berlin , economy minister michael glos upgraded berlin 's growth forecast for the current year to 1.4 percent .
glos even boldly claimed that growth could even come out as high as two percent , double the 0.9 percent recorded last year . for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are bringing out the champagne " companies are a lot more satisfied with current business than they were in december , " ifo chief sinn said .
" and they 're a great deal more confident about the outlook for the next six months . " eco n omic spri n g i n the air the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy has been brightening for some time , nurtured by a raft of positive real economic data .
earlier this month , investor confidence , as measured by the monthly economic expectations index calculated by fellow think-tank zew , topped a two-year high point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery is picking up speed " there is a definite sense of economic spring in the air in germany .
german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .
" this should be a massive confidence boost to recovery expectations . " ixis economist , laure maillard , also said the ifo numbers confirmed the german economy has been gaining momentum since the middle of last year . indeed , " january 's sharp rise is all the more encouraging in that it came in a context of rising oil prices and euro-dollar exchange rate , " she said . brown at bear stearns said the ifo data were consistent with german gdp growth of more than 2 percent this year . schmieding at bank of america said the strength of the ifo data could persuade the european central bank to raise interest rates again soon . " we expect the next quarter-point rate hike in march , followed by further moves in june and september , " the analyst said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs .

the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?
" from gloom to boom in less than a year , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .

" reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .
in berlin , economy minister michael glos upgraded berlin 's growth forecast for the current year to 1.4 percent .
glos even boldly claimed that growth could even come out as high as two percent , double the 0.9 percent recorded last year . for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are bringing out the champagne " companies are a lot more satisfied with current business than they were in december , " ifo chief sinn said .
" and they 're a great deal more confident about the outlook for the next six months . " eco n omic spri n g i n the air the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy has been brightening for some time , nurtured by a raft of positive real economic data .
earlier this month , investor confidence , as measured by the monthly economic expectations index calculated by fellow think-tank zew , topped a two-year high point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery is picking up speed " there is a definite sense of economic spring in the air in germany .
german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .
" this should be a massive confidence boost to recovery expectations . " ixis economist , laure maillard , also said the ifo numbers confirmed the german economy has been gaining momentum since the middle of last year . indeed , " january 's sharp rise is all the more encouraging in that it came in a context of rising oil prices and euro-dollar exchange rate , " she said . brown at bear stearns said the ifo data were consistent with german gdp growth of more than 2 percent this year . schmieding at bank of america said the strength of the ifo data could persuade the european central bank to raise interest rates again soon .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen if hamas is victorious ?
radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .
it should n't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case . w. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future : he faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office , which could send him to prison for up to five years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter weather is snow joke for christmas criminals two thieves who went on a christmas crime wave were arrested after their footprints in the fresh snow led the cops from the scene of the crime to the front door of the criminals ' abode .

the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?
" from gloom to boom in less than a year , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" german business leaders , who were still ridden by ' angst ' last spring , now seem to be almost dancing in the streets . " reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .
in berlin , economy minister michael glos upgraded berlin 's growth forecast for the current year to 1.4 percent .
glos even boldly claimed that growth could even come out as high as two percent , double the 0.9 percent recorded last year . for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are bringing out the champagne " companies are a lot more satisfied with current business than they were in december , " ifo chief sinn said .
" and they 're a great deal more confident about the outlook for the next six months . " eco n omic spri n g i n the air the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy has been brightening for some time , nurtured by a raft of positive real economic data .
earlier this month , investor confidence , as measured by the monthly economic expectations index calculated by fellow think-tank zew , topped a two-year high point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery is picking up speed " there is a definite sense of economic spring in the air in germany .
german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .
" this should be a massive confidence boost to recovery expectations . " ixis economist , laure maillard , also said the ifo numbers confirmed the german economy has been gaining momentum since the middle of last year . indeed , " january 's sharp rise is all the more encouraging in that it came in a context of rising oil prices and euro-dollar exchange rate , " she said . brown at bear stearns said the ifo data were consistent with german gdp growth of more than 2 percent this year . schmieding at bank of america said the strength of the ifo data could persuade the european central bank to raise interest rates again soon . " we expect the next quarter-point rate hike in march , followed by further moves in june and september , " the analyst said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen if hamas is victorious ?
radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace .

" germans had not been the main target group , as far as abductions are concerned .
but it certainly had an impact on the criminals ' strategy that the french and italian governments paid ransoms to free their hostages .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin is much in demand as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action . the bluster coming out of tehran of late has put western capitals on edge of late . the eu 3 - great britain , france and germany - appear ready to abandon further diplomatic efforts at halting iran 's uranium-enrichment plans in favor of possible sanctions through the un security council .
but sanctions are the last thing on the mind of some security council members , notably russia . prime minister vladimir putin has in the past wanted to protect iran , an important trading and energy partner .
but even moscow seems frustrated at tehran 's increasing hard line , say experts , and will assume a key position in the crisis talks of the coming weeks . iran 's affront to europe " if russia puts itself clearly on the western side of this equation , then iran runs the danger of isolating itself , " said oliver thränert , an iran expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has stepped up the rhetoric , and does n't seem concerned isolation has n't seemed to bother iran up until now .
after meeting with eu negotiators at the beginning in october 2003 , tehran rejected outright a package of incentives presented by eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the fall of 2005 designed to stop the enrichment of uranium at iranian nuclear facilities .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin is much in demand as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action . the bluster coming out of tehran of late has put western capitals on edge of late . the eu 3 - great britain , france and germany - appear ready to abandon further diplomatic efforts at halting iran 's uranium-enrichment plans in favor of possible sanctions through the un security council .
but sanctions are the last thing on the mind of some security council members , notably russia . prime minister vladimir putin has in the past wanted to protect iran , an important trading and energy partner .
but even moscow seems frustrated at tehran 's increasing hard line , say experts , and will assume a key position in the crisis talks of the coming weeks . iran 's affront to europe " if russia puts itself clearly on the western side of this equation , then iran runs the danger of isolating itself , " said oliver thränert , an iran expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has stepped up the rhetoric , and does n't seem concerned isolation has n't seemed to bother iran up until now .
after meeting with eu negotiators at the beginning in october 2003 , tehran rejected outright a package of incentives presented by eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the fall of 2005 designed to stop the enrichment of uranium at iranian nuclear facilities .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb . on jan .
10 , iran began uranium-enrichment activities at several nuclear facilities , the ultimate affront to european negotiators .
the eu-3 soon joined washington in calling for the matter to be taken up by the security council . missing a military threat at an emergency meeting of the board of governors of the international atomic and energy agency in vienna on feb .
2 , the eu-3 and the us will be looking to convince russia and council member china to come down harder on tehran .
the two holdouts on the five-member security council could veto any sanctions proposal . " if russia does n't move , then it 's 3-2 -lrb- votes in the un security council -rrb- , and that 's a very comfortable situation for iran , " said thränert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan is cause for concern a defeat of the sanctions proposal in the un security council would only encourage tehran , say experts , especially without a visible military threat from the west .
though washington has repeatedly said it will take no option off of the table , tehran seems emboldened by america 's difficulties in iraq and afghanistan . " they seem pretty confident that there wo n't be a military threat from the west , " said frank umbach , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" and that is the west 's dilemma , something mohammed elbaradei has also mentioned in recent weeks . " merkel lobbying russia without the threat of military action or sanctions , the eu and washington 's main hope remains convincing russia .
and moscow has given them reason for optimism in recent days .
a moscow proposal foresees russia and tehran jointly enriching uranium in russia .
the plan , which has interested iran , could provide the west more oversight over iranian nuclear activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , and china , may be the keys to resolving the issue germany could play an important role in lobbying putin 's support .
of the eu-3 , germany still has the best ties to moscow , said thränert . " we can also build a bridge to russia , " he said .
" merkel wo n't be able to do it herself , but our relationship to moscow is still better than that of the french and british .

" those who sent these two technicians over there and let them work without protection bear a heavy responsibility , " gernot erler , a deputy foreign minister , told thursday 's edition of the daily süddeutsche zeitung . cryotec , a leipzig-based engineering firm , sent rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , to work at the baiji oil refinery compound in northern iraq for a few days but they were seized on tuesday by armed men in military uniform . it was " absolutely clear " that the company should be asked to make a contribution to the costs incurred in trying to secure the men 's release , erler said . his call was backed by wolfgang bosbach , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" it would be a symbolic contribution , not compensation , " bosbach told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . while there was no immediate response from cryotec , the company 's sales director , peter bienert on wednesday appealed for the release of his colleagues in an interview with the regional leigziger volkszeitu n g newspaper . " what i want to see is our colleagues return quickly and in good health , " he said . in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no contact with the kidnappers , and government spokesman thomas steg said the reason for the abduction was still unknown . roadblocks and security controls us and iraqi forces have set up roadblocks and increased security controls in a bid to rescue the men , who , according to a security official , were bundled into civilian pick-up trucks . a guard at the refinery , whose access was cordoned off , told afp the germans were snatched by seven men , all in army uniform , including two with officer rank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kidnappers were reportedly posing as iraqi soldiers " they drove them off towards the north of the town , " mohammad ahmad said . a successful abductio n i n dustry ? according to newspaper reports , a third german was able to escape from the attackers , but there 's no news from him either . the president of germany 's bnd intelligence agency , ernst uhrlau , said he was shocked by what appeared to be yet another abduction case .
he said it would take some time to identify who was behind the disappearance of the two german engineers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier and his deputy , klaus scharioth , during a crisis group meeting on tuesday " iraq is increasingly being associated with a successful abduction industry , " he said .
" the people involved in this trade may have a fundamentalist , nationalist or simply criminal background .
but the experience gathered over the past two years has shown us that once there are hostages , the various kidnappers in iraq have a strong network of communication among themselves .
this makes it impossible right now to say who exactly is behind the disappearance of the two german engineers . " some german nationals are understood to work at the baiji power station , located some 200 kilometers -lrb- 140 miles -rrb- north of baghdad , from where a brazilian engineer was kidnapped a year ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video still showing susanne osthoff -lrb- third from left -rrb- in the hands of her kidnappers joao jose vasconcellos was kidnapped in january 2005 and authorities have heard nothing of his fate since . iraq 's oil ministry also said it was looking into the report . latest i n a surge of abductio n s more than 250 foreigners have been taken hostage in iraq since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled dictator saddam hussein .
a number , including westerners , have been killed . the abduction of the germans was just the latest seizure of foreigners in iraq over the past few weeks . us journalist jill carroll was taken captive jan .
7 by militants who threatened to kill her , while two kenyan telecommunications engineers were kidnapped last week . there is still no news on the fate of four western peace activists kidnapped in late november , while a jordanian held hostage said in a videotape his captors set a new deadline to execute him . more abductio n s to follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joao jose vasconcelos michael pohly , a middle east expert , said that the recent abductions may only be the beginning of a series of further kidnappings of germans .
he said he 's convinced that the kidnappers received a hefty ransom for osthoff 's release . " it ca n't be ruled out that the hostage affair around susanne osthoff has encouraged criminal elements in iraq to go for more , " he said .
" germans had not been the main target group , as far as abductions are concerned .
but it certainly had an impact on the criminals ' strategy that the french and italian governments paid ransoms to free their hostages . " pohly added that he is certain that the german government also paid a ransom in the osthoff case . this is making german citizens in iraq more vulnerable , he said . some 40 foreigners are currently believed to be in the hands if iraqi hostage-takers .
the german foreign ministry has issued a travel warning , saying that german citizens are advised not to visit iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 " dutch-only " bid stirs angry debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in holland demonstrate solidarity after the murder of filmmaker theo van gogh as debate rages in germany over a school banning students from speaking languages other than german , holland is grappling with its own controversy sparked by a suggestion that only dutch be spoken on the streets . on the heels of a furor over a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds , dutch immigration minister rita verdonk has sparked a new controversy in the national debate about integration of immigrants after saying this weekend that only dutch should be spoken on the streets . " speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .

the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .

" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .

with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .

the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?

" reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .

german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .
" this should be a massive confidence boost to recovery expectations . " ixis economist , laure maillard , also said the ifo numbers confirmed the german economy has been gaining momentum since the middle of last year . indeed , " january 's sharp rise is all the more encouraging in that it came in a context of rising oil prices and euro-dollar exchange rate , " she said . brown at bear stearns said the ifo data were consistent with german gdp growth of more than 2 percent this year . schmieding at bank of america said the strength of the ifo data could persuade the european central bank to raise interest rates again soon .

the government predicted the economy could grow by as much as two percent this year . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the ifo economic research institute , rose by 2.3 points to 102 points in january , ifo said in a statement .
it was the fifth monthly rise in a row and took the index to its highest level since may 2000 . the increase took analysts by surprise - consensus forecasts had the january index remaining stable at around 99.7 points . " after already improving sharply in recent months , the business climate index rose sharply again in january , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn .
" any doubts people might have about the strength of the current upturn , underway since last summer , will be further diminished by these numbers .
the upward trend is gaining in strength and breadth . " analysts were pleased by the numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon a common sight across germany ?
" from gloom to boom in less than a year , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" german business leaders , who were still ridden by ' angst ' last spring , now seem to be almost dancing in the streets . " reforms kick i n germany finally appears to be reaping the fruits of wage restraint and painful structural reforms , he said . " having been the sick man of europe for much of the last decade , germany is , for once , resuming its traditional role of a motor of economic development in the heart of europe , " schmieding said . business leaders ' optimism is shared by the government .
in berlin , economy minister michael glos upgraded berlin 's growth forecast for the current year to 1.4 percent .
glos even boldly claimed that growth could even come out as high as two percent , double the 0.9 percent recorded last year . for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business people are bringing out the champagne " companies are a lot more satisfied with current business than they were in december , " ifo chief sinn said .
" and they 're a great deal more confident about the outlook for the next six months . " eco n omic spri n g i n the air the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy has been brightening for some time , nurtured by a raft of positive real economic data .
earlier this month , investor confidence , as measured by the monthly economic expectations index calculated by fellow think-tank zew , topped a two-year high point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery is picking up speed " there is a definite sense of economic spring in the air in germany .
german business confidence is booming , " said bear stearns economist david brown .
" this should be a massive confidence boost to recovery expectations . " ixis economist , laure maillard , also said the ifo numbers confirmed the german economy has been gaining momentum since the middle of last year . indeed , " january 's sharp rise is all the more encouraging in that it came in a context of rising oil prices and euro-dollar exchange rate , " she said . brown at bear stearns said the ifo data were consistent with german gdp growth of more than 2 percent this year . schmieding at bank of america said the strength of the ifo data could persuade the european central bank to raise interest rates again soon . " we expect the next quarter-point rate hike in march , followed by further moves in june and september , " the analyst said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .

and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .

the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers .

" i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .
it should n't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case . w. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future : he faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office , which could send him to prison for up to five years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter weather is snow joke for christmas criminals two thieves who went on a christmas crime wave were arrested after their footprints in the fresh snow led the cops from the scene of the crime to the front door of the criminals ' abode .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .

" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .

" china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 merkel to open davos economy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world economic forum is getting underway again in davos german chancellor angela merkel will give the opening speech , on the topic of european integration , at the world economic forum in davos wednesday . the swiss alpine ski resort of davos is hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum , one of the globe ’ s most high-profile economic events and usually a prime target for anti-globalization campaigners . there won ’ t be as many state and government leaders present at the forum this year , but one of the highlights of the five-day event will be the opening address by germany 's recently elected chancellor .
merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

" those who sent these two technicians over there and let them work without protection bear a heavy responsibility , " gernot erler , a deputy foreign minister , told thursday 's edition of the daily süddeutsche zeitung . cryotec , a leipzig-based engineering firm , sent rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , to work at the baiji oil refinery compound in northern iraq for a few days but they were seized on tuesday by armed men in military uniform . it was " absolutely clear " that the company should be asked to make a contribution to the costs incurred in trying to secure the men 's release , erler said . his call was backed by wolfgang bosbach , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" it would be a symbolic contribution , not compensation , " bosbach told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . while there was no immediate response from cryotec , the company 's sales director , peter bienert on wednesday appealed for the release of his colleagues in an interview with the regional leigziger volkszeitu n g newspaper . " what i want to see is our colleagues return quickly and in good health , " he said . in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no contact with the kidnappers , and government spokesman thomas steg said the reason for the abduction was still unknown . roadblocks and security controls us and iraqi forces have set up roadblocks and increased security controls in a bid to rescue the men , who , according to a security official , were bundled into civilian pick-up trucks . a guard at the refinery , whose access was cordoned off , told afp the germans were snatched by seven men , all in army uniform , including two with officer rank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kidnappers were reportedly posing as iraqi soldiers " they drove them off towards the north of the town , " mohammad ahmad said . a successful abductio n i n dustry ? according to newspaper reports , a third german was able to escape from the attackers , but there 's no news from him either . the president of germany 's bnd intelligence agency , ernst uhrlau , said he was shocked by what appeared to be yet another abduction case .
he said it would take some time to identify who was behind the disappearance of the two german engineers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier and his deputy , klaus scharioth , during a crisis group meeting on tuesday " iraq is increasingly being associated with a successful abduction industry , " he said .
" the people involved in this trade may have a fundamentalist , nationalist or simply criminal background .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .
it should n't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case . w. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future : he faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office , which could send him to prison for up to five years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter weather is snow joke for christmas criminals two thieves who went on a christmas crime wave were arrested after their footprints in the fresh snow led the cops from the scene of the crime to the front door of the criminals ' abode .

" we must believe that our country can live better from its ideas , " she said in remarks which reprised many of the themes she used in her successful drive toward the chancellery last year . faced with an increasingly competitive world , she added , " we have no choice but this urgency to change .

" bureaucracy often stifled innovation , she said .
" we must get away from the idea that a directive is for all time . " trade merkel pledged that germany would do all it could to push stuttering talks on liberalising trade . negotiators failed to make substantial progress at world trade organisation talks last month in hong kong amid persistent rifts over the scope and pace of liberalization in the agriculture , services and industrial goods sectors .

" more than three-quarters of people expect hooliganism in the 12 cities where the matches will be played while two-thirds believe fans will clash with police in the stadiums , according to a poll carried out by the tns emnid institute . such fears are not unfounded - the most recent world cup played in europe , the 1998 tournament in france , was scarred by brawling english fans and an attack by german skinheads which left a french policeman physically and mentally disabled . the last finals , in japan and south korea in 2002 , were trouble-free , but most observers attributed that to the fact they were staged far from the traditional european " centers " of hooliganism , such as england and the netherlands . high-risk factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer is often cheaper than soft drinks in germany the wide availability of cheap beer in germany , the fact that the country is served by cheap flights from all over europe and its many shared borders make the 2006 tournament potentially high-risk . yet michael endler , a high-ranking german police officer and an expert on hooligans from the office of criminal investigation in the western city of düsseldorf , said there was no reason to panic . " not every supporter brandishing a country 's flag and holding a glass of beer is going to commit violence , " endler said . endler and his staff from the central sport information unit -lrb- zis -rrb- will play a key role during the finals . gatheri n g i n tellige n ce they say the key to preventing violence is intelligence-gathering . " during the world cup , we will process between 800 and 1,000 pieces of information from germany and abroad , " endler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will monitor activities inside the stadiums and keep an eye on potential hooligans outside data will be collected centrally and then sent to the police forces in the 16 federal states ahead of each of the 64 matches to allow security arrangements to be planned locally . " beyond that there will be officers who know the scene from germany and abroad reporting on the situation in the stadiums , " endler said . the unit will swell from its current size of 17 members of staff to around 150 in may and will move to neuss near düsseldorf in time for the june 9 kickoff . endler 's unit was created in 1992 to observe the hooligan scene in germany because most of the main professional clubs in the country are based in that region .
it began working in collaboration with its counterparts abroad for the 2002 world cup in asia and the euro 2004 finals in portugal . i n ter n atio n al cooperatio n diplomatically , endler refused to be drawn on which countries ' fans were considered high-risk . " wherever we have the potential for violence , we will be informed by the participating countries shortly before the start of the world cup , " he said .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .

how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .

rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen if hamas is victorious ?
radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?
israel and the us refuse to have contacts with hamas .
the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .
she said diplomatically that the eu would respect the election outcome and cooperate with anyone who adheres to a non-violent path to peace .
the eu commission has even offered to double aid in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence , not economic development , still dominates in the gaza strip " this only makes sense if israel and palestine work together constructively and eu members states approve , " she said .
" we have to find the right conditions , the right climate and surroundings . " many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .
the only problem is that the airport itself was destroyed by the israeli army during the last intifada : both runway and tower have been wrecked . keepi n g their weapo n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians now have to decide the unwillingness by hamas officials to renounce violence is also likely to make europeans think twice about increasing their aid .
hamas officials vowed wednesday not to disarm or negotiate with the jewish state if it enters the palestinian parliament after the election . unbowed by international pressure to lay down arms if his party achieves the electoral success many predict , chief candidate ismail haniya said there was no contradiction between guns and democracy as he voted in a gaza refugee camp . " the americans and the europeans say to hamas : either you have weapons or you enter the legislative council , " he said .
" we say -lrb- we will have -rrb- weapons and the legislative council , there is no contradiction between the two .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner .

" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?

the eu has blacklisted the group after many terrorist attacks .
but officials do maintain contact with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group does play an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . during her last appearance before the european parliament a few days ago , ferrero-waldner did not say what the eu would do should hamas win the elections .

" many eu planers believe that contacts and trade opportunities with the rest of the world are key to a viable palestinian state that is meant to be the outcome of the so-called " road map to peace . " that 's why ferrero-waldner announced that the eu was willing to spend 25 million euros on a cargo terminal at gaza airport during her last visit .

radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .
eu officials have not revealed whether they would cut the bloc 's massive aid should the group gain power . as palestinians headed to the polls wednesday to elect a new parliament , eu officials have whenever she travels to the middle east , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner takes along a suitcase full of money .
she proudly uses every chance she gets to mention that the european union is the largest donor to the palestinian territories . last year , about 380 million euros -lrb- $ 589.4 million -rrb- made their way from europe to the gaza strip and the west bank and this year , even more money is expected to flow .
for the elections , ferrero-waldner freed up 18.5 million euros .
another 20 million euros have been set aside for energy supply and environmental protection projects . the massive aid packages have given eu diplomats the feeling that nothing can happen in the palestinian territories without the europeans .
the eu holds the financial plug to the palestinian bath tub , as the bloc 's envoy to the middle east , marc otte , once put it . a lot of money goes to the palestinian authority and local politicians to help set up a civil administration , a judicial and police system and to support small and medium-sized businesses .
the largest sum - 122 million euros - is still set aside for food and refugee aid that is distributed by the un 's aid organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner accusations that the money has been misappropriated , mainly during the time when the late palestinian leader yasser arafat was still personally overseeing the fund , have now been proven to be wrong , according to ferrero-waldner . " all inquiries by the eu agency that combats fraud have shown that no embezzlement took place , " she said .
" that 's why the palestinian authority is able to use the funds correctly with our help . " the eu as impartial mediator the eu plans to spend three million euros for border controls between the gaza strip and egypt at rafah crossing point .
it is money well spent , according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana : the 70 eu officials that advise on border controls have been welcomed by israel , the palestinians and the us .
solana enjoys the role of impartial mediator and is constantly trying to expand the eu 's political weight in the middle east . with such large financial aid in tow , solana is also trying to exert pressure on the palestinian leadership and hamas , the radical islamist faction behind a majority of attacks on israel , which could likely form part of the government after wednesday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in december , solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government , leading a hamas representative to complain to eu election observers in ramallah . worki n g with hamas ?

" we must believe that our country can live better from its ideas , " she said in remarks which reprised many of the themes she used in her successful drive toward the chancellery last year . faced with an increasingly competitive world , she added , " we have no choice but this urgency to change .

" bureaucracy often stifled innovation , she said .
" we must get away from the idea that a directive is for all time . " trade merkel pledged that germany would do all it could to push stuttering talks on liberalising trade . negotiators failed to make substantial progress at world trade organisation talks last month in hong kong amid persistent rifts over the scope and pace of liberalization in the agriculture , services and industrial goods sectors .

rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .

" we must believe that our country can live better from its ideas , " she said in remarks which reprised many of the themes she used in her successful drive toward the chancellery last year . faced with an increasingly competitive world , she added , " we have no choice but this urgency to change . " merkel was the keynote speaker at the first day of the annual gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss ski resort of davos . bringing germany back executives were keen to hear her strategy of how to lead germany out of its economic malaise , crippled by low growth - 1.5 percent is predicted for this year - and unemployment that in december stood at more than 11 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have no choice but this urgency to change . "
" we are as if paralyzed by events , and do not seem to be able to overcome them , " she said in her half-hour speech . " something has to be done .
we as the biggest economy in europe must assume our responsibilities in europe .
we have to do it in our own particular way . " it meant sweeping reforms on tax and the budgetary system , reducing labour costs , revamping germany 's federal structure " in order to improve and expedite decision-making " and creating long-term stability to attract investors . citing " terrifyingly high unemployment " across europe , she added : " we have to make sure the political world intervenes at the right points and withdraws when it 's appropriate . " bureaucracy often stifled innovation , she said .
" we must get away from the idea that a directive is for all time . " trade merkel pledged that germany would do all it could to push stuttering talks on liberalising trade . negotiators failed to make substantial progress at world trade organisation talks last month in hong kong amid persistent rifts over the scope and pace of liberalization in the agriculture , services and industrial goods sectors . " we saw what happened in hong kong , " merkel went on .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .

how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .

rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" however , he promised that any deficit-cutting recommendations from the commission would not threaten a growing recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia will decide if germany faces sanctions next month " that 's a necessity not just in germany but also for the rest of the euro area , " he said . germany - the eu 's largest economy - has failed for four years to keep its budget deficit under the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product .
it is still not clear if the eu will place germany in the " excessive deficit procedure " status or give the country more time to let its new government trim public spending .
if it does n't , germany may have to pay billions in fines or face tighter eu scrutiny and controls on its budgets . optimistic ahead of a meeting with euro-zone finance ministers , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he was confident the commission would agree not to press ahead with disciplinary measures against berlin because of the deficit . he said he was " optimistic about the possibility of an agreement with the commission " and that " we have no interest for an escalation " in tensions . luxembourg prime ministers jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro-zone finance ministers , said they were " satisfied " with berlin 's deficit cutting efforts .

the 63-year-old munich judge -lrb- whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons -rrb- might have been married , but he would n't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman . what does matter a little in this particular case is that w. met fatime l. in his courtroom .
the 30-year-old albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover . all that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile .
the judge , however , pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as " i 'm kissing you awake " and " alone with you in bed .
i want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you . " he might have gotten away with it all .
but then w. withdrew an offer to sentence fatime 's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man 's jail time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice were definitely out of balance in this case " he should be sent away for longer so that you 're at peace or he should be sent to his wife , which might also help , " the judge wrote .
" it 's up to you . " that did it for fatime , who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend 's defense lawyer .
it should n't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case . w. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future : he faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office , which could send him to prison for up to five years . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter weather is snow joke for christmas criminals two thieves who went on a christmas crime wave were arrested after their footprints in the fresh snow led the cops from the scene of the crime to the front door of the criminals ' abode .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " world powers split over iran nuclear program iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " europe -pipe- 25.01.2006 in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin is much in demand as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action . the bluster coming out of tehran of late has put western capitals on edge of late . the eu 3 - great britain , france and germany - appear ready to abandon further diplomatic efforts at halting iran 's uranium-enrichment plans in favor of possible sanctions through the un security council .
but sanctions are the last thing on the mind of some security council members , notably russia . prime minister vladimir putin has in the past wanted to protect iran , an important trading and energy partner .
but even moscow seems frustrated at tehran 's increasing hard line , say experts , and will assume a key position in the crisis talks of the coming weeks . iran 's affront to europe " if russia puts itself clearly on the western side of this equation , then iran runs the danger of isolating itself , " said oliver thränert , an iran expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has stepped up the rhetoric , and does n't seem concerned isolation has n't seemed to bother iran up until now .
after meeting with eu negotiators at the beginning in october 2003 , tehran rejected outright a package of incentives presented by eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the fall of 2005 designed to stop the enrichment of uranium at iranian nuclear facilities .
enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb . on jan .
10 , iran began uranium-enrichment activities at several nuclear facilities , the ultimate affront to european negotiators .
the eu-3 soon joined washington in calling for the matter to be taken up by the security council . missing a military threat at an emergency meeting of the board of governors of the international atomic and energy agency in vienna on feb .
2 , the eu-3 and the us will be looking to convince russia and council member china to come down harder on tehran .
the two holdouts on the five-member security council could veto any sanctions proposal . " if russia does n't move , then it 's 3-2 -lrb- votes in the un security council -rrb- , and that 's a very comfortable situation for iran , " said thränert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan is cause for concern a defeat of the sanctions proposal in the un security council would only encourage tehran , say experts , especially without a visible military threat from the west .
though washington has repeatedly said it will take no option off of the table , tehran seems emboldened by america 's difficulties in iraq and afghanistan . " they seem pretty confident that there wo n't be a military threat from the west , " said frank umbach , an iran expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" and that is the west 's dilemma , something mohammed elbaradei has also mentioned in recent weeks . " merkel lobbying russia without the threat of military action or sanctions , the eu and washington 's main hope remains convincing russia .
and moscow has given them reason for optimism in recent days .
a moscow proposal foresees russia and tehran jointly enriching uranium in russia .
the plan , which has interested iran , could provide the west more oversight over iranian nuclear activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , and china , may be the keys to resolving the issue germany could play an important role in lobbying putin 's support .
of the eu-3 , germany still has the best ties to moscow , said thränert . " we can also build a bridge to russia , " he said .
" merkel wo n't be able to do it herself , but our relationship to moscow is still better than that of the french and british .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .
" other southeast asian countries have also embarked on a course of rapid economic growth .
all of them will develop such an enormous need for oil that classical large oil-supply recipients in the industrialised west will soon have major difficulties getting enough oil for their needs . " meeting attracts the famous like every year , swiss locals in davos are hoping to catch a glimpse of the many prominent guests at the meeting .
among them are actress angelina jolie , a un goodwill ambassador for refugees , anti-poverty campaigner bono and bill gates . some 5,000 members of the swiss armed forces are on the ground to protect the economic and political makers and shakers against expected anti-globalisation protests . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed .

merkel will speak to well over 2,000 business leaders and politicians from around the globe . focus on economic reform a spokesman for the german government in berlin said the chancellor would be focussing her speech on issues related to european integration . merkel will be the only government leader to attend the event from the g8 group of most-developed industrialized nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is the only g8 leader to attend this year 's summit merkel will also explain in detail the economic reform policy of germany 's new " grand coalition " government , of center-right christian democrats and the more left-wing social democrats .
the davos meeting coincides with the first release by the berlin government of its economic forecast for 2006 and beyond . a spokesman for the chancellor 's office said merkel is likely to stress that her country is on its way to higher growth rates than expected in autumn of last year , but she will also be unable to avoid the topic of entrenched , record-high unemployment . putting politics aside this year 's world economic forum will largely steer clear of political issues , putting business concerns center stage , organizers said .
the discussions will focus on the increasing global problems of matching economic growth , particularly in threshold countries , and depleting energy resources . “ oil supplies are getting scarcer with each passing year , " said friedmann mueller , an economist from the german science and politics foundation .
" this is not primarily because reserves are running out , but because the major oil-supplying countries are investing far too little in technology to adapt to global demands .
the west can ’ t really change this decisively , because the major oil producing nations are russia and those in the middle east , and their willingness to let in foreign investors is extremely limited . ” mueller said he doubted whether the davos meeting can really sketch out solutions to a looming large-scale energy crisis , particularly as far as oil supplies are concerned . " china ’ s oil hunger is increasing rapidly , and the situation in india will be similar in 5 to 10 years , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2006 opinion : education is the key to integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german only , not just in class but outside it too news of a berlin school banning its students from speaking languages other than german on school grounds has migrant groups up in arms .
deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?
with a ubiquitous microphone that will record everything that the students are saying everywhere ?
how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

" speaking dutch in the street is very important .
i receive more and more e-mails from people saying they feel ' unheimisch ' -lrb- ill at ease -rrb- in the street , " verdonk said at a weekend congress of her liberal vvd party about integration . the minister 's comment seemed to contradict her own dutch-only call , since she resorted to using the german word ' unheimisch , ' which translates loosely into ' ill at ease ' but has no direct translation in dutch . " i want to set up a code of conduct about what we as dutch people feel is important if you live here , " she added . going too far ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch immigration and integration minister is also called " iron rita " the 50-year-old verdonk , who represents a new hardline face of her party with her restrictive asylum and integration policies , also wants to deport 26,000 rejected asylum-seekers as soon as possible and further limit immigration . the minister , whose plans for obligatory tests of dutch language and culture paid for by prospective immigrants recently got the green light from the parliament , now wants to set up a code of conduct that will forbid the use of a foreign language in the streets of the netherlands . in the country 's largest city amsterdam , which is home to 173 different nationalities and receives some 24 million tourists annually , municipal authorities were quick to dismiss the idea . " i think this is going too far , " laetitia griffith , who heads amsterdam 's economic affairs and is a fellow vvd member , said . " amsterdam is a metropolis that attracts foreign investors who praise the dutch tolerance .
if i speak surinamese with a friend in the street and we are not causing a nuisance , then there is nothing wrong with that , " griffith , who is of surinamese origin , told the volkskrant newspaper . code of behavior controversial according to the popular de telegraaf daily , a majority of parliament , consisting of the ruling cda christian democrats , vvd and the opposition right-wing fringe party lpf , supports verdonk 's plans but says it should be up to municipalities to decide if they want to put the code of conduct into place . dutch port city rotterdam recently introduced a similar code of conduct .
rotterdam , where half of the population is of immigrant descent , adopted a code with seven points set up to regulate contact between its inhabitants . it states that dutch should be the official language used " in school , at work , in the street and in community centers . " " an informal code will not change people 's behavior , " progressive christian daily trouw wrote tuesday , recalling that the rotterdam code says people " should do " something , but does not require the " must do " it . in the hague , where the municipality is fighting to keep several international institutions currently based there , authorities are none too taken with the idea , according to pieter van woensel , the vvd 's local alderman for international affairs . " i think it is not very likely that it will be a success , " he told the nrc-handelsblad paper . " no language police " confronted with the media controversy about her plans , verdonk on monday told dutch public radio that people would not be forbidden from using their native language if it is not dutch . " there will not by a law or some sort of language police , " she said .
" what is important is that foreigners who want to permanently reside in the netherlands use dutch as the language of communication . " last week the dutch parliament approved plans to have prospective immigrants take obligatory dutch culture and language tests , priced at 350 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- .
but the government is not making any preparatory courses available beyond a film presenting the netherlands and providing examples of the tests . recently dutch public television broadcast a program in which various groups residing in the netherlands sat the tests - among them native-born dutch nationals , chinese restaurant owners and so on . they all failed . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

deutsche welle 's verica spasovska says the measure will promote integration . a berlin high school , where 90 percent of students are of non-german origin , embarked on a bold experiment a year ago by ordering students to not just speak german during lessons , but also on school grounds during recess , and during school trips and other events . until a few days ago , the whole affair was wrapped in silence .
but then the first media reports on the herbert-hoover high school , followed by an entire avalanche of articles , has suddenly found politicians of the former communist party , the pds , the opposition greens and representatives of turkish migrant organizations up in arms against the regulation . enforcing german by means of a decree is an intrusion by the state into the personal development of an individual , say opponents of the measure . self-imposed code of behavior it 's indeed difficult to imagine how the language ban will be implemented .
how will the teachers check whether students are really speaking german during recess ?

how will violations be penalized ?
with an entry in the class register ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are divided over the language measure in the berlin school the key question is whether you can successfully promote integration with such measures .
and the answer is in the affirmative .
and the berlin school with its students who come from 10 nations are showing how it can be done . for starters , we 're not talking about a directive that has been imposed dictatorially by the school 's headmaster against the wishes of the students and parents .
rather , it 's self-imposed , and is supported by a majority of students and parents . education the key the reason why they 've accepted this code of behavior is because both students and parents have realized that it helps the kids if they speak good german when it comes to looking for traineeships and eventually jobs .
they 've realized that education is the key to integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg district is home to a huge immigrant population it 's a view that is in no way obvious given that many migrant families have a low level of education .
and those who value the school education of their kids move away from districts which are home to a large migrant population and in turn lower education standards . even in the aforementioned berlin school , teachers do n't punish students who violate the language measure , rather they just admonish them .
it 's apparent that you ca n't force integration with bans .
the german ban on school grounds ca n't replace the important role of the teachers . that 's why the concept of the herbert-hoover school also lies in offering more german lessons than other schools .
it 's undoubtedly also the reason why the school has received more student registrations than any other berlin school in the neighborhood . starting to learn early the controversial language measure in the herbert-hoover school is an attempt to remedy a glaring deficit in the german education system .
ever since the first pisa study on education standards was published five years ago , we 're aware that the social background of people in germany - more than in any other european countries - determines how well kids do at school . where , if not at school , should children from immigrant backgrounds learn german ?
particularly those children who come from economically-impoverished backgrounds and homes where only the mother tongue is spoken , can often only speak colloquial german . bildunterschrift : starting early with a language is important of course it would be better if in future fostering a language began even before children went to school .
that 's what the state of north rhine-westphalia is planning . there all children , not just of immigrant background , will in future be tested for their language abilities two years before they go to school in order to identify deficits and to rectify them . measure not discriminatory this measure is n't discriminatory , just as the banning of languages other than german on school grounds is n't either .
rather , it amounts to misguided consideration on our part if we fail to actively emphasize the importance of learning german .
only those who have a good command of german can participate in social life in germany . this fact should n't just be impressed upon migrants , but should also be recognized by german states , which often tend to save money in the wrong places . verica spasovska -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

mr enkhbold was the widely expected choice , being the mongolian people 's revolutionary party -lrb- mprp -rrb- candidate .
mongolia was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when the mprp withdrew from the governing coalition , causing prime minister tsakhia elbegdorj to resign .
the rebels said they were protesting against mr elbegdorj 's policies , which they claimed were damaging the economy .
but members of mr elbegdorj 's democrat party accused the mprp of toppling the administration because they wanted to stop the drive against corruption .
the political crisis has sparked days of public protests , with supporters of both sides braving sub-zero temperatures to come out on the streets and make their voices heard .
mr enkhbold , the chairman of the mongolian people 's revolutionary party , was given official approval by president nambaryn enkhbayar on tuesday , as well as the majority of the parliament .
his approval was expected as the mprp was confident of securing a majority vote with the support of minority parties .
mr enkhbold , 41 , will now begin appointing his cabinet and setting up the new government .

mr enkhbold was the widely expected choice , being the mongolian people 's revolutionary party -lrb- mprp -rrb- candidate .
mongolia was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when the mprp withdrew from the governing coalition , causing prime minister tsakhia elbegdorj to resign .
the rebels said they were protesting against mr elbegdorj 's policies , which they claimed were damaging the economy .
but members of mr elbegdorj 's democrat party accused the mprp of toppling the administration because they wanted to stop the drive against corruption .
the political crisis has sparked days of public protests , with supporters of both sides braving sub-zero temperatures to come out on the streets and make their voices heard .
mr enkhbold , the chairman of the mongolian people 's revolutionary party , was given official approval by president nambaryn enkhbayar on tuesday , as well as the majority of the parliament .
his approval was expected as the mprp was confident of securing a majority vote with the support of minority parties .
mr enkhbold , 41 , will now begin appointing his cabinet and setting up the new government .

if approved , it is expected to be at the holywood exchange development near belfast city airport .
representatives from the chain are expected to arrive in northern ireland later this week to discuss the project .
the east belfast mp , peter robinson , is supporting the move , which would see the retail giant setting up and bringing hundreds of jobs .
" here we have an opportunity to have an ikea on our doorstep in the harbour estate , " said the dup deputy leader .
" i think the only thing that would put them off is if they are delayed long by the planning service .
" i hope the planning service will fast-track this .
there is great employment potential - 400-500 jobs are possible .
" that has to be something that is economically good for northern ireland . "
last year , the government in the irish republic lifted its cap on the size of retail outlets , paving the way for ikea to enter the irish market .

dr michael irwin was struck off the medical register last year for obtaining drugs to help a friend die .
he admits that in the last two years he has given advice and encouragement to five terminally-ill people to fly from england to zurich 's dignitas clinic .
it is the clinic which helped british woman anne turner to die on tuesday .
dr irwin told bbc radio four 's today programme : " in the past two years , i have given advice and encouragement and counsel to five terminally-ill people to go from england over to dignitas in zurich .
" am i breaking the law ?
if they had committed suicide in this country , the answer is yes .
however they got to switzerland , but they could have changed their minds , they could have been rejected by dignitas . "
police interview surrey police interviewed 74-year-old dr irwin last august , and they have confirmed that their investigation continues .
the maximum penalty for aiding and abetting suicide in england and wales is 14 years in prison . "
i hope that i will be questioned by the police , because i think this would be a very fascinating medical legal situation " dr irwin dr irwin , a former un medical director and head of the voluntary euthanasia society , has already received a police caution for his actions .
he has also accompanied a patient from scotland , where there is no specific law against assisted suicide .
he told today : " suicide was never a crime in scotland - so there is no crime of aiding and abetting and of counselling suicide under scottish law .
" and i hope that i will be questioned by the police , because i think this would be a very fascinating medical legal situation . "
dr irwin was struck off the medical register by the general medical council last september .
he told today : " my only medical crime was to write a single prescription for a class c drug in my name , intending to give this to a friend of mine on the isle of man who was dying - rather slowly - from cancer of the prostate .
" in the end , he was too ill to take the pills that i was able - or willing - to give to him .
" i did not show any remorse when it came to my actual hearing before the gmc - in fact , i challenged them on this issue by saying that all good doctors should be compassionate to help similar patients in these situations . "
he said the gmc 's decision to strike him off the medical register meant nothing to him as he was already retired , and that he was not afraid to go to prison for his beliefs .
controversial clinic since the dignitas clinic was set up in 1998 , more than 450 people from across europe have ended their lives there , including more than 40 from britain .
opponents of assisted suicide say it is wrong to take human life in this way - and argue that good quality palliative care is the right approach .
on tuesday , retired doctor anne turner took her own life with the help of doctors at the controversial swiss clinic .
dr turner , 66 , from bath , had a progressive and incurable degenerative disease called supranuclear palsy .
she could only walk with a stick and faced a future in a wheelchair .
dr turner 's condition , which also afflicted comedian dudley moore , also left with her with badly slurred speech , and she had some difficulty swallowing .

dr turner , 66 , from bath , had a progressive and incurable degenerative disease called supranuclear palsy .
she could only walk with a stick and faced a future in a wheelchair .
dr turner 's condition , which also afflicted comedian dudley moore , also left with her with badly slurred speech , and she had some difficulty swallowing .

it is the clinic which helped british woman anne turner to die on tuesday .
dr irwin told bbc radio four 's today programme : " in the past two years , i have given advice and encouragement and counsel to five terminally-ill people to go from england over to dignitas in zurich .
" am i breaking the law ?
if they had committed suicide in this country , the answer is yes .
however they got to switzerland , but they could have changed their minds , they could have been rejected by dignitas . "
police interview surrey police interviewed 74-year-old dr irwin last august , and they have confirmed that their investigation continues .
the maximum penalty for aiding and abetting suicide in england and wales is 14 years in prison .
i hope that i will be questioned by the police , because i think this would be a very fascinating medical legal situation dr irwin dr irwin , a former un medical director and head of the voluntary euthanasia society , has already received a police caution for his actions .
he has also accompanied a patient from scotland , where there is no specific law against assisted suicide .
he told today : " suicide was never a crime in scotland - so there is no crime of aiding and abetting and of counselling suicide under scottish law .
" and i hope that i will be questioned by the police , because i think this would be a very fascinating medical legal situation . "
dr irwin was struck off the medical register by the general medical council last september .
dr turner had a progressive degenerative disease he told today : " my only medical crime was to write a single prescription for a class c drug in my name , intending to give this to a friend of mine on the isle of man who was dying - rather slowly - from cancer of the prostate .
" in the end , he was too ill to take the pills that i was able - or willing - to give to him .
" i did not show any remorse when it came to my actual hearing before the gmc - in fact , i challenged them on this issue by saying that all good doctors should be compassionate to help similar patients in these situations . "
he said the gmc 's decision to strike him off the medical register meant nothing to him as he was already retired , and that he was not afraid to go to prison for his beliefs .

staff working for the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- , including many from raf st athan in south wales , will rally in central london on wednesday .
union leaders said the planned cuts would harm the support given to servicemen and women in the frontline .
up to 500 jobs are to go at st athan when the £ 130m fast jet operation switches to an raf base in norfolk .
armed forces minister adam ingram has said the uk government 's investment in the project will be recovered by the time fast jet work finishes in 2007 - even thought the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- is pulling out earlier than planned .
but union leaders have warned that thousands of jobs could be lost and millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money " squandered " by uk government policies .
more than 500 workers from across the uk are expected to take part in the protest .
the protesters , accompanied by wales rugby international dwayne peel , will demonstrate outside the mod before attending a rally and then lobbying mps at westminster .
' serious threat ' mark serwotka , general secretary of the public and commercial services union , said members were travelling to london to say " enough is enough " .
mr serwotka said the cuts would have a " devastating impact " on the communities and local economies affected .
he added : " in the meantime , we also have a massive programme of privatisation of key areas of defence with private defence companies lining up , hoping to swallow up massive contracts worth billions which are often only renewable after 25 years .
" members will be raising these issues with their local mps to enlist their support for our ongoing campaign to save britain 's defence from this most serious threat . "
over the next few weeks , union officials will also meet defence workers across the uk to prepare for an industrial action ballot in protest at the decision to close st athan .
' world class ' a joint union statement said : " we believe that these plans will , at the very least , result in greater expenditure and heavier reliance on monopoly private suppliers .
" at worst , it represents an attack on the ability of our armed services to function and may jeopardise frontline armed services and service personnel safety . "
the decision to close the site has been criticised by many of labour 's own mps .
but mr ingram has insisted that commercial interest in south wales ' " world-class " aerospace facility would not be affected by the job losses .

' serious threat ' mark serwotka , general secretary of the public and commercial services union , said members were travelling to london to say " enough is enough " .
mr serwotka said the cuts would have a " devastating impact " on the communities and local economies affected .
he added : " in the meantime , we also have a massive programme of privatisation of key areas of defence with private defence companies lining up , hoping to swallow up massive contracts worth billions which are often only renewable after 25 years .
" members will be raising these issues with their local mps to enlist their support for our ongoing campaign to save britain 's defence from this most serious threat . "
over the next few weeks , union officials will also meet defence workers across the uk to prepare for an industrial action ballot in protest at the decision to close st athan .
' world class ' a joint union statement said : " we believe that these plans will , at the very least , result in greater expenditure and heavier reliance on monopoly private suppliers .
" at worst , it represents an attack on the ability of our armed services to function and may jeopardise frontline armed services and service personnel safety . "
the decision to close the site has been criticised by many of labour 's own mps .
but mr ingram has insisted that commercial interest in south wales ' " world-class " aerospace facility would not be affected by the job losses .

the protesters shouted anti-war slogans and many of them carried banners criticising us president george w bush .
the annual meeting is seen as an ideological alternative to the world economic forum , attended by business leaders in the swiss resort of davos .
delegates will discuss fair trade , debt forgiveness and indigenous rights .
the country 's president , hugo chavez , is attending the six-day forum .
some 10,000 people from 54 countries joined the anti-war march in caracas .
peace activist cindy sheehan , the mother of an american soldier killed in iraq , addressed the crowds , saying the us needed to bring its troops home immediately .
global outlook other speakers will include argentine nobel peace prize winner adolfo perez esquivel , uruguayan writer eduardo galeano and former french first lady danielle mitterand .
organisers say more than 60,000 people have registered to take part in seminars , workshops and panels to be held across the capital over the next six days .
the event is backed by funding from the venezuelan government , which has reportedly subsidised the travel of some latin american delegates .
many of those marching shouted slogans praising mr chavez , who is also expected to address the conference .
the bbc 's greg morsbach in caracas says some delegates are concerned the forum may lose its global outlook and instead be dominated by debates surrounding big social changes in venezuela .
however , others say they are happy to learn about the government-sponsored social projects designed to improve education and health care , our correspondent adds .
the world social forum was first held in the southern brazilian resort of porto alegre in 2001 , as an " antidote " to the big-business world economic forum .
it strongly opposes globalisation and wants both the corporations and the governments of the west to do more for the people and nations of the developing world .

but it 's not the heavy topics that make davos special .
the belvedere hotel in davos is buzzing .
hundreds of people with excited faces crowd into a huge room , incessantly chatting , forming small clusters here and there , and constantly moving around .
most are complete strangers , but have one thing in common : a white badge the size of a credit card .
it 's what made them come from all over the world to this bitterly cold and snow-bound valley high in the swiss alps .
the badge is their passport to the world economic forum , and they are determined to make good use of it .

but it 's not the heavy topics that make davos special .
the belvedere hotel in davos is buzzing .
hundreds of people with excited faces crowd into a huge room , incessantly chatting , forming small clusters here and there , and constantly moving around .
most are complete strangers , but have one thing in common : a white badge the size of a credit card .
it 's what made them come from all over the world to this bitterly cold and snow-bound valley high in the swiss alps .
the badge is their passport to the world economic forum , and they are determined to make good use of it .
networking is the name of the game , or schmoozing , as some would call it .
you 're here , you must be interesting business cards change hand at a rapid clip ; old friends embrace ; people move around with their eyes set chest-high where those white badges dangle , displaying name and affiliation of each participant .
the best thing is the opportunity to take your mind away from running a company for a few days and learn new stuff markus brehler , enocean it 's a diverse bunch of people , but they have one thing in common , says one of the participants : " the great thing about davos is this assumption that you must be interesting , just because you are here . "
and in most cases the assumption is right .
take markus brehler , the founder of enocean .
his cutting-edge tech firm has developed ultra-low power sensors and switches that get their energy from unlikely sources like vibration and temperature .
it 's environmentally friendly and does away with miles of cabling .
it 's his first time in davos and he is keen to meet potential business contacts .
" but the best thing is the opportunity to take your mind away from running a company for a few days and learn new stuff , " he says .
take matthieu ricard , a molecular geneticist by training , now co-director of the buddhist shechen monastery in nepal .
celebrities , entrepreneurs and world leaders are all attending dressed in purple and orange robes , he is here to discuss what makes people happy .
" we work so hard to improve ourselves , but our outer conditions contribute to just 15 % of our well-being , " he says .
" i want to talk about what makes out the rest of our happiness . "
and of course he wants to network as well , in the hope of finding help for the 16 clinics his monastery runs in nepal and tibet , and for his schools in the desperately poor districts high up in the himalayas .
njabulo ndebele is the vice-chancellor of the university of cape town , and looking forward to a meeting with university presidents from around the world .
wang jianmao is a professor at the china europe international business school in shanghai and eager " to promote china , to make sure that it is treated as an equal member of the international community " .
a man with a mission the davos agenda is packed .
too packed for many .
amory lovins runs the rocky mountain institute , an environmental research lab .
you would never be able to meet that many interesting people in one place in normal life mack gill , sungard he pulls out two large pieces of paper , tightly printed in small font to list the talks he has to give , sessions he hopes to attend , and the numerous events he would really love to go to but is unlikely to be able to squeeze in .
he dives into his backpack , pulls out a bowl and bangs it hard with a metal stick without making a dent .
" i 'll give a speech to a meeting of the chief executives of all the world 's top car makers this week , " he says .
" i 'll show them this new light-weight carbon fibre thermo plastic composite material " , which is lighter than steel or aluminium , just as tough and will do wonders for fuel efficiency .
davos is full of people like that , and the best place to make connections and your case .
serene on the outside , davos is a hotbed of activity " you would never be able to meet that many interesting people in one place in normal life , " says mack gill .
the 36-year old runs the rapidly growing offshore operation of financial software giant sungard in india .
it 's his first time in davos , and he confesses to being " really excited " about the five days that lie ahead .
talking trade but it 's not all talk .
once again the forum has attracted many of the world 's most influential trade ministers .
nearly 30 of them are in town , and as in previous years they are meeting on the sidelines of the event to hammer out a framework that could restart the global trade round .
the fact that they do so surrounded by top executives of the world 's largest multinational companies will fan the suspicion of critics of the world 's trade regime .
china is at the top of the agenda anti-poverty group actionaid has just released a report to coincide with the wef start , accusing corporate lobbyists of having " an undue influence on the current global trade talks " .
and in a way davos is indeed the perfect place to lobby , whether for a good cause or your country .
india is making davos the focus of its new " india everywhere " campaign , with a huge delegation of top government officials and business leaders .
others are betting on the powers of jazz .
the state of louisiana has invited to a " bring back new orleans " party , hoping to persuade investors to return to the hurricane-battered region .
many of the people that louisiana needs to persuade will be among the white badge holders in davos .

changes are proposed to protect bats and two sports clubs in porthmadog .
businesses had been worried about the impact of the new road but increased traffic has convinced some that it would benefit the town .
the bypass would begin to the north of tremadog and then rejoin the a487 in minffordd , near penrhyndeudraeth , to the south of porthmadog .
one change , near minffordd , would lessen the impact of the new road on an important bat roost .
the other change would lessen the impact of the road on the grounds of both the porthmadog sports club and porthmadog town football club - the initial preferred route would have separated the clubs ' shared facilities .
businesses in porthmadog now feel a bypass would benefit the town one local businessman nigel hughes said he was concerned about part of the proposed route .
he added : " i 'm worried about the part which passes the bottom of porthmadog because during a very wet winter the water level there is quite high , and i 'm not sure if they 've taken that into consideration .
" another thing is the fact that most of the traffic travelling through porthmadog does not go on toward caernarfon , but rather towards the llyn peninsula , so there is going to be a bottle neck at the penamser end of the town , " he added .
the plans will be on show at the glaslyn leisure centre until 27 january , with officials from the welsh assembly government , consultants halcrow group ltd and white young green planning available to answer questions .
plans will also be displayed at porthmadog library until 6 march .
