it said it was necessary for teachers to have eye contact with pupils in classes . august gmünd from the local government , which supports the suspension , said the action had caused disruption throughout the school . “ a heated discussion broke out in the school the instant the two girls turned up , not just amongst the kids , but also the teachers , " said gmünd .
" it was just impossible to maintain a controlled environment in the school . ” the girls have been suspended from school for two weeks , for disrupting lessons .
officials say they are welcome to return to school , if they shed their all-enveloping garb .
at the school playground , the appearance of the covered girls confused and annoyed pupils . " provocation " and " fundamentalist character " “ one of the girls was in class with me , " said a student .
" i find it very strange : before the easter holidays , she was personable and outgoing .
now , after the holidays , she turns up in a burka . ” ulrich stahnke , head master at the school in tannenbusch on the outskirts of bonn , said he spent days considering whether to suspend the girls .
he added he and his colleagues had tried to convince them to discard their burkas , without success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say turning up for class like this in germany is a provocation “ for me , this is a new development in central europe , which one is either aware of , or consciously brings into school as a provocation , " stahnke said .
" or , one takes a religious angle with it , which , in a very specific way , has a fundamentalist character . ” the two girls have cited freedom of religion in defense of their outfits .
their families have hired a lawyer , who has yet to issue a statement . " symbolizing female oppression " even those who wear headscarves at the school have little empathy for the girls .
one pupil of kurdish origin , is now campaigning for a completely headscarf free school . “ class 11 and 12 have put together a petition with signatures from classmates who frown on their decision , " she said .
" we also have the full support of the school board .
we think it ’ s out of order to show up at school like this .
as a kurd , and a woman , i feel it ’ s my responsibility to show that this isn ’ t on , and that it symbolizes female oppression . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women were forced by the taliban to cover themselves from head to toe afghanistan 's taliban regime , which was overthrown by u.s.-led forces in late 2001 , introduced a law making it compulsory for all women to wear the garments . not helping integration for head master stahnke , the girls are harming the school ’ s integration policy .
around 30 percent of pupils either come from migrant families , or are themselves migrants .
stahnke said the school ‘ wants to show these children that they can follow their religion without wearing burkas ’ .
he now hopes the girls will participate in counseling sessions with a theological expert , and reconsider their decision . the case follows moves by france , home to europe 's largest islamic minority , to ban islamic headscarves and other " conspicuous religious signs " in state schools in 2004 .
the measures is aimed at stemming what it said was the rising influence of radical islamists among youths . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east berliners oppose mosque germans in a small east berlin neighborhood are protesting plans to build a mosque there .

they 'll hope for a better start than in 2002 - they were battered 8-0 by this year 's hosts . world cup qualifiers world cup qualification as an obstacle ?
not for saudi arabia 's soccer players .
the team confidently completed the qualifiers and won the top slot in group a ahead of south korea . stars in addition to old hand sami al-jaber , who shot two goals in three world cup tournaments , strikers mohammad al-shlhoub and ibrahim al-shahrani belong to the pillars of the arab team .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .

" although the cup is not as important here as it is in say england , the final is still a highlight , " said magath .
" no german team has managed to defend the double so that is our target . " for magath the match also has added spice as frankfurt sacked him as manager back in 2001 . it proved a blessing in disguise as he took over at vfb stuttgart and his sterling work eventually netted him the bayern job in july 2004 . frankfurt ready for an upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt are always up for giving bayern a run for their money friedhelm funkel is his opposite number in the dug-out come saturday and the frankfurt manager is relishing the underdog role .
" i like facing bayern .
there is no bigger incentive for players than beating bayern in front of 75,000 fans and we will certainly enjoy it , " declared funkel . three-time winners frankfurt may be outsiders but they underlined their pedigree with a 6-0 demolition of last year 's finalists schalke on route to their first cup final in 18 long years . bayern have had to wait just 12 months to reach berlin again and hope to lift the trophy for the 13th time . in 14 cup finals bayern have only lost twice to bayer uerdingen back in 1985 and werder bremen in 1999 . first timers on both sides want glory bayern 's german international goalkeeper oliver kahn has won the competition four times but for his team-mate philipp lahm it is all a new experience . " this is my first big final and i can not wait , " said lahm .
" i want to lift my first title . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioannis amanatidis wants a first medal in the red of frankfurt for frankfurt players it is also the chance to secure a rare winners medal and greek international ioannis amanatidis is raring to take on bayern .
" it is the biggest moment of my career , " enthused amanatidis . " we wanted bayern and that is who we have .
it is also a bonus that they are there as we will qualify for europe whatever happens .

" belarus was one of the issues discussed where russia and the alliance are quite far apart , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in the bulgarian capital sofia . " we did not see eye to eye , " he added , a day after calling milinkevich 's arrest a sign of " anti-democratic behavior " . de hoop scheffer said belarus had failed to live up to nato values enshrined in the partnership for peace agreements signed between the alliance and many ex-communist states after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . but lavrov responded by saying : " these issues have to be decided through engagement and dialogue , not through isolation . " belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko won a landslide victory in march 19 presidential elections that sparked protests at home and condemnation abroad . the european union and the united states slapped diplomatic sanctions in the wake of the vote and a crackdown against opposition activists protesting lukashenko 's victory . milinkevich , who came a distant second in the election , was sentenced on thursday to 15 days in jail along with three other opposition figures for attending a demonstration declared illegal . opposition leader declares imprisonment a " political sentence " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkevich milinkevich said wednesday 's protest , coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear disaster , was not illegal because the crowd of about 6,000 had gathered at a place allocated to them by the city authorities .

it said it was necessary for teachers to have eye contact with pupils in classes . august gmünd from the local government , which supports the suspension , said the action had caused disruption throughout the school . “ a heated discussion broke out in the school the instant the two girls turned up , not just amongst the kids , but also the teachers , " said gmünd .
" it was just impossible to maintain a controlled environment in the school . ” the girls have been suspended from school for two weeks , for disrupting lessons .
officials say they are welcome to return to school , if they shed their all-enveloping garb .
at the school playground , the appearance of the covered girls confused and annoyed pupils . " provocation " and " fundamentalist character " “ one of the girls was in class with me , " said a student .
" i find it very strange : before the easter holidays , she was personable and outgoing .
now , after the holidays , she turns up in a burka . ” ulrich stahnke , head master at the school in tannenbusch on the outskirts of bonn , said he spent days considering whether to suspend the girls .
he added he and his colleagues had tried to convince them to discard their burkas , without success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say turning up for class like this in germany is a provocation “ for me , this is a new development in central europe , which one is either aware of , or consciously brings into school as a provocation , " stahnke said .
" or , one takes a religious angle with it , which , in a very specific way , has a fundamentalist character . ” the two girls have cited freedom of religion in defense of their outfits .
their families have hired a lawyer , who has yet to issue a statement . " symbolizing female oppression " even those who wear headscarves at the school have little empathy for the girls .
one pupil of kurdish origin , is now campaigning for a completely headscarf free school . “ class 11 and 12 have put together a petition with signatures from classmates who frown on their decision , " she said .
" we also have the full support of the school board .
we think it ’ s out of order to show up at school like this .
as a kurd , and a woman , i feel it ’ s my responsibility to show that this isn ’ t on , and that it symbolizes female oppression . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women were forced by the taliban to cover themselves from head to toe afghanistan 's taliban regime , which was overthrown by u.s.-led forces in late 2001 , introduced a law making it compulsory for all women to wear the garments . not helping integration for head master stahnke , the girls are harming the school ’ s integration policy .
around 30 percent of pupils either come from migrant families , or are themselves migrants .
stahnke said the school ‘ wants to show these children that they can follow their religion without wearing burkas ’ .
he now hopes the girls will participate in counseling sessions with a theological expert , and reconsider their decision . the case follows moves by france , home to europe 's largest islamic minority , to ban islamic headscarves and other " conspicuous religious signs " in state schools in 2004 .
the measures is aimed at stemming what it said was the rising influence of radical islamists among youths . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east berliners oppose mosque germans in a small east berlin neighborhood are protesting plans to build a mosque there .

" on the other hand , of course i also think it would be great if leipzig were to present itself not only as a city of books , but maybe more as city for modern literature .
leipzig as the quasi-uncrowned queen of german-language literature . "
but niessen and graebel said they 've decided not to wait and hope the leipzig tourist board picks up the ball .
instead they 're using " turboprop " as a stepping stone for up-and-coming young authors and point to clemens meyer , whose novel was celebrated at this year 's leipzig book fair .

" if berlin were a private company , the city would have gone bankrupt long ago , " said sarrazin , who is in charge of a growing , 60 billion-euro -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- debt burden as the city state 's finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- wants to get more than this scarf from his bavarian counterpart , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- together with berlin mayor klaus wowereit , sarazzin this week began trying to convince germany 's highest court to order the federal government and other german states to help repay the capital 's debt . berlin officials base their case on a 1992 ruling by the court that forced the federal government to help out the states of bremen and saarland , who were also struggling to cope with high debt .
germany 's constitution requires states and the federal government to help each other in case of financial problems . " we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " wowereit told judges at the federal constitutional court , adding that his government had done everything it could to save costs .
" now we need federal solidarity . " livi n g beyo n d its mea n s ? but the german government and most of wowereit 's fellow state premiers see things differently .
they argue that berlin has only itself to blame for its financial problems .
they also say that the city continues to live beyond its means , citing the upkeep of three universities , three opera houses and six housing authorities as examples .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.04.2006 bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jubiliant bayern munich celebrate after clinching the title a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .
the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .

" although the cup is not as important here as it is in say england , the final is still a highlight , " said magath .
" no german team has managed to defend the double so that is our target . " for magath the match also has added spice as frankfurt sacked him as manager back in 2001 . it proved a blessing in disguise as he took over at vfb stuttgart and his sterling work eventually netted him the bayern job in july 2004 . frankfurt ready for an upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt are always up for giving bayern a run for their money friedhelm funkel is his opposite number in the dug-out come saturday and the frankfurt manager is relishing the underdog role .

" this is my first big final and i can not wait , " said lahm .
" i want to lift my first title . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioannis amanatidis wants a first medal in the red of frankfurt for frankfurt players it is also the chance to secure a rare winners medal and greek international ioannis amanatidis is raring to take on bayern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2006 germany , eu urge peaceful solution to iran crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has said iran 's failure is " unacceptable " iran 's failure to meet a un deadline to stop uranium enrichment has heightened concerns in western countries even as germany and the eu insist that the row can only be resolved diplomatically . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on friday said iran 's failure to comply with the united nations ' 30-day deadline to halt uranium enrichment was unacceptable . " all those involved have a duty to look for ways to calm the situation and when i say that , i lay most of the responsibility at the door of iran , which has up to now not only showed no sign of compromise but has consistently taken the wrong path , " steinmeier said .
" this we can not accept , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is still sticking to his guns the deadline set by the un security council expired on friday , a day after hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his nation " will not bow to injustice and pressure . " in a report released in vienna on friday , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei said tehran had failed to comply with the security council 's demand .
his report paves the way for the security council to adopt a resolution legally obliging iran to cooperate with the iaea , the un 's atomic watchdog , and eventually to punish the islamic republic with economic sanctions . germany insists on diplomatic solution steinmeier was speaking to reporters after meeting with his counterpart from oman , yousuf bin alawi bin abdullah , shortly after returning from a nato conference in the bulgarian capital sofia .
he said foreign ministers of the 26-nation transatlantic alliance agreed that the international community should form a strong united front on the iranian nuclear crisis in further deliberations at the security council . " we agreed that in further discussions at the security council , the international community should now stand firm so as to make clear to iran what the negative consequences of self isolation would be . " he added that germany was intent on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff on iran 's nuclear power program , which washington and its allies believe masks a bid to develop atomic weapons . " we remain convinced that only a diplomatic solution can resolve the situation , " steinmeier added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has said a diplomatic solution is the only way forward eu foreign policy chief javier solana also expressed dismay at iran 's failure to comply with the un deadline . " i 'm disappointed that in such a serious situation iran did n't meet the deadline set by the un security council , " solana told german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we 'll work further for a diplomatic solution .
the security council is now expected to act . " on saturday , iranian sources said tehran was ready for a resumption of a monitoring of its nuclear program . the deputy head of the iaea , mohammed saidi told state television that the condition was that the case should n't be taken up by the un security council but instead should be referred back to the iaea .

" all those involved have a duty to look for ways to calm the situation and when i say that , i lay most of the responsibility at the door of iran , which has up to now not only showed no sign of compromise but has consistently taken the wrong path , " steinmeier said .
" this we can not accept , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is still sticking to his guns the deadline set by the un security council expired on friday , a day after hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his nation " will not bow to injustice and pressure . " in a report released in vienna on friday , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei said tehran had failed to comply with the security council 's demand .
his report paves the way for the security council to adopt a resolution legally obliging iran to cooperate with the iaea , the un 's atomic watchdog , and eventually to punish the islamic republic with economic sanctions . germany insists on diplomatic solution steinmeier was speaking to reporters after meeting with his counterpart from oman , yousuf bin alawi bin abdullah , shortly after returning from a nato conference in the bulgarian capital sofia .
he said foreign ministers of the 26-nation transatlantic alliance agreed that the international community should form a strong united front on the iranian nuclear crisis in further deliberations at the security council . " we agreed that in further discussions at the security council , the international community should now stand firm so as to make clear to iran what the negative consequences of self isolation would be . " he added that germany was intent on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff on iran 's nuclear power program , which washington and its allies believe masks a bid to develop atomic weapons . " we remain convinced that only a diplomatic solution can resolve the situation , " steinmeier added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has said a diplomatic solution is the only way forward eu foreign policy chief javier solana also expressed dismay at iran 's failure to comply with the un deadline . " i 'm disappointed that in such a serious situation iran did n't meet the deadline set by the un security council , " solana told german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we 'll work further for a diplomatic solution .
the security council is now expected to act . " on saturday , iranian sources said tehran was ready for a resumption of a monitoring of its nuclear program . the deputy head of the iaea , mohammed saidi told state television that the condition was that the case should n't be taken up by the un security council but instead should be referred back to the iaea .
saidi added that could mean that iran could continue its controversial uranium-enrichment program , but it would at the same time allow surprise checks of its nuclear facilities . representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council and germany will meet in paris on tuesday to decide the further course of action .
the council could also impose sanctions on iran . iran expected to dominate merkel , bush talks on friday , us president george w bush spoke to german chancellor angela merkel on the telephone about the crisis surrounding the iranian stance .
merkel will head to the us next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush 's next meeting will be dominated by iran bush said that iran had to be aware that it was the common goal of several countries to nudge the country on to a peaceful path , away from its nuclear ambitions . according to germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , the german government is in favor of a new internationally-binding un resolution which did n't automatically include the possibility of sanctions .
erler told german daily frankfurter rundschau that even a resolution that did away with the word ' sanctions ' could ' lead to very concrete disadvantages for iran . ' the international stance on iran was now increasingly under pressure , said erler .
he added that german foreign minister steinmeier would urge the us to directly talk to tehran about the nuclear row . chancellor merkel is expected to do the same when she meets bush next week . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea : iran has failed to comply with un demands iran has failed to comply with a un deadline to halt uranium enrichment , un nuclear chief mohamed elbaradei said in a report friday that opens the door to possible international sanctions .

but there was no rubbing of gloves in glee from his rivals .
kahn will play on for two years after this summer ’ s world cup and will undoubtedly push to end his career at the top of the game . " after the world cup i will play for two more years at bayern munich , and then this phase of life is over for me , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- .
" i will not end this phase of life with a retirement but with my head held high , accepting the situation as it is . " many expected kahn to at least stand down from international duty when arsenal 's jens lehmann was named as germany 's first choice goalkeeper for the world cup earlier this month .
however , far from throwing in the towel , kahn showed dignity in accepting the role of understudy .
" if i am needed at the world cup , i am there , " kahn told the faz .
his contract with bayern runs until june 30 , 2008 . dw-world.de kahn : i 'll play in world cup oliver kahn has moved to quell speculation over his future by insisting that he wants to be part of germany 's world cup squad despite being told he is no longer first-choice goalkeeper .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .
bayern could complete the historic double " double " on wednesday night when they entertain stuttgart , if hamburg slip up against second-from-bottom club cologne the night before . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cup final presents bayern with chance to make more history no german team has managed to win the league and cup double in successive seasons but bayern munich have a great chance of achieving that feat if they can defeat eintracht frankfurt in saturday 's german cup final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.04.2006 bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jubiliant bayern munich celebrate after clinching the title a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .
the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .
bayern could complete the historic double " double " on wednesday night when they entertain stuttgart , if hamburg slip up against second-from-bottom club cologne the night before . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cup final presents bayern with chance to make more history no german team has managed to win the league and cup double in successive seasons but bayern munich have a great chance of achieving that feat if they can defeat eintracht frankfurt in saturday 's german cup final .

denmark and greece had still not notified where they stand although copenhagen was also expected to maintain its restrictions . the netherlands has backtracked from initial plans to lift restrictions and instead will keep them in place until the end of the year , when the dutch parliament will review the country 's position . countries that have not notified the commission of their plans by sunday april 30 will have to automatically lift restrictions . eu officials hope others will follow the european commission , which has long encouraged member states to welcome workers from their eastern neighbors , voiced satisfaction that restrictions were being lifted or eased but also said that more could be done . " overall it is satisfactory but we hope that there will be further improvement between now and 2009 , " said katharina von schnurbein , the commission spokeswoman for social issues .
" it is really good news that three countries are lifting the restrictions and almost all the other countries have lifted some restrictions either in some sectors or they are going to be gradually lifting their restrictions up until 2009 . " all restrictions , which do not apply to cyprus and malta , are supposed to be phased out over a seven-year period and the first of three phases is due to end on april 30 .
eu states are normally not allowed to discriminate against workers on the basis of nationality within the bloc . fears of i n creased job competitio n u n fou n ded ? but the restrictions were included in the terms for the new countries joining the eu because of concerns in some older member states about a potential flux of eastern workers happy with lower wages and taking jobs from locals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain immediately welcomed workers after their contries became eu members in 2004 those fears crystallized in some older member states such as france around the stereotype of the " polish plumber " who it was feared would ruthlessly undercut local rivals . but the european commission argues that evidence from britain , ireland and sweden does not bear such fears out and that letting eastern workers in can even have beneficial effects for the host country 's economy . in february , the commission issued a report that found " the movement of free workers has not had disruptive effects on the labor market .

germany 's constitution requires states and the federal government to help each other in case of financial problems .

sarrazin counters that the city has already done more to cut costs than others : while expenditures of germany 's states on average rose by 3.3 percent during the last decade , berlin has lowered them by 11 percent over the same period .
more than 70,000 municipal jobs have been eliminated and more will disappear in the future , sarrazin said . " we have to do everything we can , " he said , adding that the city has virtually exhausted its options to save money .
the city has to pay 2.5 billion euros in annual interest payments alone . problems rooted i n postwar period sarrazin hopes that federal judges will honor berlin 's efforts to deal with its debt - the origins of which can be traced back to the city 's special status after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's postwar division played a big role as far as the city 's financial problems are concerned almost all companies turned their back on west berlin after 1945 and moved their headquarters to west germany .

" if berlin were a private company , the city would have gone bankrupt long ago , " said sarrazin , who is in charge of a growing , 60 billion-euro -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- debt burden as the city state 's finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- wants to get more than this scarf from his bavarian counterpart , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- together with berlin mayor klaus wowereit , sarazzin this week began trying to convince germany 's highest court to order the federal government and other german states to help repay the capital 's debt . berlin officials base their case on a 1992 ruling by the court that forced the federal government to help out the states of bremen and saarland , who were also struggling to cope with high debt .
germany 's constitution requires states and the federal government to help each other in case of financial problems . " we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " wowereit told judges at the federal constitutional court , adding that his government had done everything it could to save costs .
" now we need federal solidarity . " livi n g beyo n d its mea n s ? but the german government and most of wowereit 's fellow state premiers see things differently .
they argue that berlin has only itself to blame for its financial problems .
they also say that the city continues to live beyond its means , citing the upkeep of three universities , three opera houses and six housing authorities as examples .
berlin should keep privatizing before asking others for money , they say . " more should be saved , and there should also be efforts to capitalize on property holdings that berlin still has , " gerhard stratthaus , the finance minister of the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , recently said in a radio interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bleak times ahead for germany 's capital ?
sarrazin counters that the city has already done more to cut costs than others : while expenditures of germany 's states on average rose by 3.3 percent during the last decade , berlin has lowered them by 11 percent over the same period .
more than 70,000 municipal jobs have been eliminated and more will disappear in the future , sarrazin said . " we have to do everything we can , " he said , adding that the city has virtually exhausted its options to save money .
the city has to pay 2.5 billion euros in annual interest payments alone . problems rooted i n postwar period sarrazin hopes that federal judges will honor berlin 's efforts to deal with its debt - the origins of which can be traced back to the city 's special status after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's postwar division played a big role as far as the city 's financial problems are concerned almost all companies turned their back on west berlin after 1945 and moved their headquarters to west germany .
siemens moved to munich and frankfurt 's emergence as germany 's financial capital only became possible because of berlin 's demise . after the fall of the wall , the state-owned businesses in the eastern part of the city collapsed as well .
the city government remains berlin 's most important employer and prevents the city 's unemployment rate of some 20 percent from climbing even higher . ba n ki n g o n research a n d culture considering the city 's lack of major industry , berlin supporters say the capital should focus on research and culture as sectors to secure its economic survival . " berlin does n't have mines , berlin does n't have an industry - it has culture and is germany 's intellectual center , " said peter raue , a lawyer and art patron , who helped bring the hugely successful " moma in berlin " exhibition to the city in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin live more frugally as the seat of germany 's parliament ?
but berlin critics argue that berlin should stop demanding money by arguing that it needs to shine as germany 's capital . " i think the rest of the republic would be very happy if berlin would fulfil its obligations as a capital by allowing the federal government to do a good job , " said claudius seidl , a journalist who regularly writes about berlin 's lack of style .

" belarus was one of the issues discussed where russia and the alliance are quite far apart , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in the bulgarian capital sofia . " we did not see eye to eye , " he added , a day after calling milinkevich 's arrest a sign of " anti-democratic behavior " . de hoop scheffer said belarus had failed to live up to nato values enshrined in the partnership for peace agreements signed between the alliance and many ex-communist states after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . but lavrov responded by saying : " these issues have to be decided through engagement and dialogue , not through isolation . " belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko won a landslide victory in march 19 presidential elections that sparked protests at home and condemnation abroad . the european union and the united states slapped diplomatic sanctions in the wake of the vote and a crackdown against opposition activists protesting lukashenko 's victory . milinkevich , who came a distant second in the election , was sentenced on thursday to 15 days in jail along with three other opposition figures for attending a demonstration declared illegal . opposition leader declares imprisonment a " political sentence " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkevich milinkevich said wednesday 's protest , coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear disaster , was not illegal because the crowd of about 6,000 had gathered at a place allocated to them by the city authorities . " we had asked for permission to demonstrate in two places .
we were authorized to demonstrate in one of them , and that is where we went , " he told reporters before his trial . moscow has offered its backing to lukashenko , who has ruled belarus with an iron fist since 1994 , and russia has criticized what it sees as western interference . a russia-led election monitoring group said lukashenko won in a free and fair vote , while the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the vote was fraudulent . russian president vladimir putin also offered rare international support lukashenko , whom he said had reached out to opponents following his contested re-election last month . " it was nice to hear that you intend to work constructively with all sides , " putin told lukashenko , a pariah in the west , during a televised meeting in a saint petersburg palace . putin praises belarus elections ; calls for end of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has uses for the pariah state of belarus putin appeared to call on opposition activists - about 1,000 of whom have been briefly jailed since election day for attending anti-lukashenko protests - to end their fight . " once all emotions have subsided , i count on all who took part in the campaign to concentrate on development of the state , " putin was quoted as saying by the itar-tass news agency . lukashenko claimed that " almost the entire population and part of the opposition voted " for him , ria novosti reported . russia , together with china , cuba and a handful of ex-soviet republics , has bucked the western outcry over the belarusian election . moscow props up belarus ' soviet-style economy with vital export markets and cheap natural gas supplies , although the state-controlled gazprom giant says the price is due to rise . russia and the small ex-soviet country of 10 million people , which borders eu-members poland , latvia and lithuania , have also been engaged in talks on a possible unification for years . us fuming over putins support for pariah lukashenko bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice voiced us condemnation of belarus the relationship between russia and belarus , and the treatment of the belarusian opposition has particularly rankled with the us .

" although the cup is not as important here as it is in say england , the final is still a highlight , " said magath .
" no german team has managed to defend the double so that is our target . " for magath the match also has added spice as frankfurt sacked him as manager back in 2001 . it proved a blessing in disguise as he took over at vfb stuttgart and his sterling work eventually netted him the bayern job in july 2004 . frankfurt ready for an upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt are always up for giving bayern a run for their money friedhelm funkel is his opposite number in the dug-out come saturday and the frankfurt manager is relishing the underdog role .
" i like facing bayern .
there is no bigger incentive for players than beating bayern in front of 75,000 fans and we will certainly enjoy it , " declared funkel . three-time winners frankfurt may be outsiders but they underlined their pedigree with a 6-0 demolition of last year 's finalists schalke on route to their first cup final in 18 long years . bayern have had to wait just 12 months to reach berlin again and hope to lift the trophy for the 13th time . in 14 cup finals bayern have only lost twice to bayer uerdingen back in 1985 and werder bremen in 1999 . first timers on both sides want glory bayern 's german international goalkeeper oliver kahn has won the competition four times but for his team-mate philipp lahm it is all a new experience . " this is my first big final and i can not wait , " said lahm .
" i want to lift my first title .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .

" all those involved have a duty to look for ways to calm the situation and when i say that , i lay most of the responsibility at the door of iran , which has up to now not only showed no sign of compromise but has consistently taken the wrong path , " steinmeier said .
" this we can not accept , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is still sticking to his guns the deadline set by the un security council expired on friday , a day after hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his nation " will not bow to injustice and pressure . " in a report released in vienna on friday , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei said tehran had failed to comply with the security council 's demand .
his report paves the way for the security council to adopt a resolution legally obliging iran to cooperate with the iaea , the un 's atomic watchdog , and eventually to punish the islamic republic with economic sanctions . germany insists on diplomatic solution steinmeier was speaking to reporters after meeting with his counterpart from oman , yousuf bin alawi bin abdullah , shortly after returning from a nato conference in the bulgarian capital sofia .
he said foreign ministers of the 26-nation transatlantic alliance agreed that the international community should form a strong united front on the iranian nuclear crisis in further deliberations at the security council . " we agreed that in further discussions at the security council , the international community should now stand firm so as to make clear to iran what the negative consequences of self isolation would be . " he added that germany was intent on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff on iran 's nuclear power program , which washington and its allies believe masks a bid to develop atomic weapons . " we remain convinced that only a diplomatic solution can resolve the situation , " steinmeier added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has said a diplomatic solution is the only way forward eu foreign policy chief javier solana also expressed dismay at iran 's failure to comply with the un deadline . " i 'm disappointed that in such a serious situation iran did n't meet the deadline set by the un security council , " solana told german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we 'll work further for a diplomatic solution .
the security council is now expected to act .

" belarus was one of the issues discussed where russia and the alliance are quite far apart , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said after talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in the bulgarian capital sofia . " we did not see eye to eye , " he added , a day after calling milinkevich 's arrest a sign of " anti-democratic behavior " . de hoop scheffer said belarus had failed to live up to nato values enshrined in the partnership for peace agreements signed between the alliance and many ex-communist states after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . but lavrov responded by saying : " these issues have to be decided through engagement and dialogue , not through isolation . " belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko won a landslide victory in march 19 presidential elections that sparked protests at home and condemnation abroad . the european union and the united states slapped diplomatic sanctions in the wake of the vote and a crackdown against opposition activists protesting lukashenko 's victory . milinkevich , who came a distant second in the election , was sentenced on thursday to 15 days in jail along with three other opposition figures for attending a demonstration declared illegal . opposition leader declares imprisonment a " political sentence " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkevich milinkevich said wednesday 's protest , coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear disaster , was not illegal because the crowd of about 6,000 had gathered at a place allocated to them by the city authorities .

" the united states roundly condemns this act and sincerely hopes that the belarusian government will accept the will of the international community , " rice said . another key opposition leader , alexander kozulin , has been in jail since march 25 , when he was arrested during the break-up of an opposition rally and accused of " hooliganism " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.04.2006 bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jubiliant bayern munich celebrate after clinching the title a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .
the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .

the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double . considering their superiority in the bundesliga , bayern munich could have been expected to take eintracht frankfurt apart in the dfb cup final in berlin on saturday evening .
the best hopes of frankfurt , the team 36 points behind the league leaders , at the kick-off could well have been to keep the goal tally to a respectable level .
as it was , however , the chasm between the two teams in terms of championship points counted for nothing as the final got underway .
this was , after all , the conclusion of a knock-out competition and , by definition , anything could happen over the course of this one match .
in a tournament where eintracht frankfurt have been one of the most consistent and dominant sides throughout the campaign , the league form guide lay by the sideline in tatters .
and so it was .
bayern , the favorites to begin their historic push to become the first ever german team to complete back-toback league and cup doubles , looked sluggish as frankfurt began the game with relish .
while the underdogs attacked crisply , munich played sloppy balls and lost possession in such a nonchalant way that it seemed that the dull procession to another league title may have atrophied their desire .
poor distribution and lethargy hamper bayern 's early efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard fought nature of the game restricted skillful play owen hargreaves and philipp lahm looked like they might actually want to win the game while michael ballack 's distribution suggested he may have been watching his new club chelsea 's own title celebrations ahead of the game instead of concentrating on the task in hand .
claudio pizarro missed a good chance midway through the first half before roy makaay showed his worst profligacy by dragging a clear opportunity wide and heading past the post with the goal gaping .
at the other end , frankfurt were capitalizing on the collapse of bayern movement with great effect .
despite the loss of marko rehmer on the half hour , frankfurt 's midfield looked comfortable picking up the scraps and feeding the lively ioannis amanatidis and alexander meier up front .
both had good opportunities to test oliver kahn and linked up well to provide frankfurt with their best chance just before the half-time whistle .
more urgency but little skill heralds second half both teams came out with an injection of pace for the second half but for all the increased industry , the quality was still lacking .
ballack was presented with the first chance of the half but headed tamely into oko nikolov 's hands when a moment to look up may have paid dividends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern began to wake up when makaay rifled in a classy overhead kick which nikolov did well to touch onto the bar .
frankfurt responded with a sustained period of attacking pressure but lacked a cutting edge when it mattered .
bayern began to sense that it may be their night and the bavarians lay siege to frankfurt 's goal ; makaay again dragging a good chance across the goal from a good position .
but frankfurt were well prepared for such consistent attacking and while their resolute defending and clearing kept their opponents at bay , it did little for their own chances of stealing the game on the break .
pizarro heads bayern in front after sustained pressure the relentless probing finally paid off for bayern with 30 minutes to go when ze roberto floated over a corner to the far post where pizarro was lurking .
frankfurt 's patrick ochs missed his header and the peruvian hit-man stooped to give bayern the lead .
rather than pressing home their advnatage bayern relaxed and were lucky not to be on equal terms again .
benny köhler tangled on the edge of the arae with valerien ismael and went to ground holding his head .
frankfurt cried for a penalty but the foul - not given - was outside the box .
chaos ensued and frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel was sent to the stands for venting his spleen .
the break was enough for bayern to compose themselves again and as the clock ticked down , they began to take control with frankfurt fired up and chasing the game .
makaay finally had the ball in the net with 15 minutes to go but he was clearly offside and what would have been the killer second goal was discounted .
cup holders almost made to pay for casual play bayern had a number of chances to finish the match off but decided to play a dangerous game of possession on a couple of occasions when they out-numbered the back-tracking defenders .
it nearly back fired when frankfurt threw everyone forward in the final minutes and kahn had to save a goal bound rocket from amanatidis with two minutes to go .
the cup holders had weathered the storm and still had time to mount their own attacks in the final seconds but seemed more concerned with running the clock down than getting a second goal .
the final whistle sounded and bayern 's double dream lived on amid the celebrations .
none celebrated more than oli kahn - the first player to win five dfb cup winners medals while frankfurt trudged off to debate the missed opportunities which punctuated their brave challenge .

but , germany is not among them . the eu 's 15 older member states are supposed to tell brussels before sunday of their plans for restrictions on workers from eastern european countries that joined the bloc in its may 2004 " big bang " enlargement . at that time , most " old europe " governments kept their doors shut to potential cheap labor from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia since 2004 . only britain , ireland and sweden threw open their doors to workers from the new members while the other required work permits , which were sometimes handed out on the basis of quotas . at least three states ope n borders but as of friday , the european commission said that three other countries - finland , portugal and spain - had also decided to lift their restrictions .
meanwhile , four others - belgium , france , italy and luxembourg - had decided to ease their restrictions on eastern european workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is still preventing eastern europeans from easy access to its labor market of the 15 older eu members , only austria and germany had notified plans to stick to their existing restrictions .
denmark and greece had still not notified where they stand although copenhagen was also expected to maintain its restrictions . the netherlands has backtracked from initial plans to lift restrictions and instead will keep them in place until the end of the year , when the dutch parliament will review the country 's position . countries that have not notified the commission of their plans by sunday april 30 will have to automatically lift restrictions . eu officials hope others will follow the european commission , which has long encouraged member states to welcome workers from their eastern neighbors , voiced satisfaction that restrictions were being lifted or eased but also said that more could be done . " overall it is satisfactory but we hope that there will be further improvement between now and 2009 , " said katharina von schnurbein , the commission spokeswoman for social issues .
" it is really good news that three countries are lifting the restrictions and almost all the other countries have lifted some restrictions either in some sectors or they are going to be gradually lifting their restrictions up until 2009 . " all restrictions , which do not apply to cyprus and malta , are supposed to be phased out over a seven-year period and the first of three phases is due to end on april 30 .
eu states are normally not allowed to discriminate against workers on the basis of nationality within the bloc . fears of i n creased job competitio n u n fou n ded ? but the restrictions were included in the terms for the new countries joining the eu because of concerns in some older member states about a potential flux of eastern workers happy with lower wages and taking jobs from locals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain immediately welcomed workers after their contries became eu members in 2004 those fears crystallized in some older member states such as france around the stereotype of the " polish plumber " who it was feared would ruthlessly undercut local rivals . but the european commission argues that evidence from britain , ireland and sweden does not bear such fears out and that letting eastern workers in can even have beneficial effects for the host country 's economy . in february , the commission issued a report that found " the movement of free workers has not had disruptive effects on the labor market .

but there was no rubbing of gloves in glee from his rivals .
kahn will play on for two years after this summer ’ s world cup and will undoubtedly push to end his career at the top of the game . " after the world cup i will play for two more years at bayern munich , and then this phase of life is over for me , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- .
" i will not end this phase of life with a retirement but with my head held high , accepting the situation as it is . " many expected kahn to at least stand down from international duty when arsenal 's jens lehmann was named as germany 's first choice goalkeeper for the world cup earlier this month .
however , far from throwing in the towel , kahn showed dignity in accepting the role of understudy .
" if i am needed at the world cup , i am there , " kahn told the faz .
his contract with bayern runs until june 30 , 2008 . dw-world.de kahn : i 'll play in world cup oliver kahn has moved to quell speculation over his future by insisting that he wants to be part of germany 's world cup squad despite being told he is no longer first-choice goalkeeper .

" if berlin were a private company , the city would have gone bankrupt long ago , " said sarrazin , who is in charge of a growing , 60 billion-euro -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- debt burden as the city state 's finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- wants to get more than this scarf from his bavarian counterpart , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- together with berlin mayor klaus wowereit , sarazzin this week began trying to convince germany 's highest court to order the federal government and other german states to help repay the capital 's debt . berlin officials base their case on a 1992 ruling by the court that forced the federal government to help out the states of bremen and saarland , who were also struggling to cope with high debt .
germany 's constitution requires states and the federal government to help each other in case of financial problems . " we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " wowereit told judges at the federal constitutional court , adding that his government had done everything it could to save costs .
" now we need federal solidarity . " livi n g beyo n d its mea n s ? but the german government and most of wowereit 's fellow state premiers see things differently .
they argue that berlin has only itself to blame for its financial problems .
they also say that the city continues to live beyond its means , citing the upkeep of three universities , three opera houses and six housing authorities as examples .
berlin should keep privatizing before asking others for money , they say . " more should be saved , and there should also be efforts to capitalize on property holdings that berlin still has , " gerhard stratthaus , the finance minister of the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , recently said in a radio interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bleak times ahead for germany 's capital ?
sarrazin counters that the city has already done more to cut costs than others : while expenditures of germany 's states on average rose by 3.3 percent during the last decade , berlin has lowered them by 11 percent over the same period .
more than 70,000 municipal jobs have been eliminated and more will disappear in the future , sarrazin said . " we have to do everything we can , " he said , adding that the city has virtually exhausted its options to save money .
the city has to pay 2.5 billion euros in annual interest payments alone . problems rooted i n postwar period sarrazin hopes that federal judges will honor berlin 's efforts to deal with its debt - the origins of which can be traced back to the city 's special status after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's postwar division played a big role as far as the city 's financial problems are concerned almost all companies turned their back on west berlin after 1945 and moved their headquarters to west germany .
siemens moved to munich and frankfurt 's emergence as germany 's financial capital only became possible because of berlin 's demise . after the fall of the wall , the state-owned businesses in the eastern part of the city collapsed as well .
the city government remains berlin 's most important employer and prevents the city 's unemployment rate of some 20 percent from climbing even higher . ba n ki n g o n research a n d culture considering the city 's lack of major industry , berlin supporters say the capital should focus on research and culture as sectors to secure its economic survival . " berlin does n't have mines , berlin does n't have an industry - it has culture and is germany 's intellectual center , " said peter raue , a lawyer and art patron , who helped bring the hugely successful " moma in berlin " exhibition to the city in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin live more frugally as the seat of germany 's parliament ?
but berlin critics argue that berlin should stop demanding money by arguing that it needs to shine as germany 's capital . " i think the rest of the republic would be very happy if berlin would fulfil its obligations as a capital by allowing the federal government to do a good job , " said claudius seidl , a journalist who regularly writes about berlin 's lack of style .

it may help them ease into their fourth world cup . world cup qualifiers a respectable six wins , three draws and just one loss brought tunisia through the qualification stages .
but only a thin thread held together what sounds like an easy march to germany - it was an own-goal on the part of north african rival morocco in the last qualification game that allowed tunisia to book their tickets to germany . stars captain hatem trabelsi leads of africa 's best and most experienced defenses .
in addition to a strong line-up in front of their own posts , haykel guemamdia makes sure tunisia stay effective on the opposite end of the field as well . trainer former french national team coach roger lemerre took over for tunisia in september 2002 after the team burnt through five trainers in the previous 13 months .
two years later the tunisian team won the african championship with lemerre , and even through they had to pack their bags after the quarter-finals in the 2006 african nations cup , applications for lemerre 's job are not being accepted . world cup history tunisia is appearing at the world cup finals for the fourth time .
1978 : preliminary , 1998 : preliminary , 2002 : preliminary match schedule : preliminary round june 14 : tunisia - saudi arabia in munich june 19 : spain - tunisia in stuttgart june 23 : ukraine - tunisia in berlin world cup base tunisia found training facilities and accommodation in the bavarian city of schweinfurt . outlook when searching for inspiration , the tunisian team will no doubt look back on the 3:1 win in 1978 against mexico when they chalked up the first ever world cup victory for an african team .
though lemerre 's side is up against favored teams from spain and the ukraine , a solid performance from the tunisians would keep the group from being decided until the final match . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links federation tunisienne de football -lrb- ftf -rrb- feedback what do you think of tunisia 's chances ?

a regular at as monaco , the forward netted 11 goals and was the african zone 's top scorer .
his move to arsenal has been rewarded with a place in the champions league final . trainer under the direction of stephen keshi , togo achieved the long-sought success of qualifying for the world cup .
keshi , a former nigerian national team member , took over the position in 2002 when he left his position as co-trainer of the nigerian team after they were sent home from the african nations cup in the semi-final . but a pitiful display of soccer and early elimination from the 2005 africa cup meant the once-hero keshi was given his walking papers .
the togo 's soccer fans are still waiting to see who will be on the bench calling the shots for their team in germany . # b # world cup history germany 2006 is togo 's first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 13 : south korea- togo in frankfurt june 19 : togo - switzerland in dortmund june 23 2006 : togo - france in cologne world cup base togo decided they would stay in the wangen in southern germany during the world cup .

a regular at as monaco , the forward netted 11 goals and was the african zone 's top scorer .
his move to arsenal has been rewarded with a place in the champions league final . trainer under the direction of stephen keshi , togo achieved the long-sought success of qualifying for the world cup .
keshi , a former nigerian national team member , took over the position in 2002 when he left his position as co-trainer of the nigerian team after they were sent home from the african nations cup in the semi-final . but a pitiful display of soccer and early elimination from the 2005 africa cup meant the once-hero keshi was given his walking papers .

it may help them ease into their fourth world cup . world cup qualifiers a respectable six wins , three draws and just one loss brought tunisia through the qualification stages .

it may help them ease into their fourth world cup . world cup qualifiers a respectable six wins , three draws and just one loss brought tunisia through the qualification stages .
but only a thin thread held together what sounds like an easy march to germany - it was an own-goal on the part of north african rival morocco in the last qualification game that allowed tunisia to book their tickets to germany . stars captain hatem trabelsi leads of africa 's best and most experienced defenses .
in addition to a strong line-up in front of their own posts , haykel guemamdia makes sure tunisia stay effective on the opposite end of the field as well . trainer former french national team coach roger lemerre took over for tunisia in september 2002 after the team burnt through five trainers in the previous 13 months .
two years later the tunisian team won the african championship with lemerre , and even through they had to pack their bags after the quarter-finals in the 2006 african nations cup , applications for lemerre 's job are not being accepted . world cup history tunisia is appearing at the world cup finals for the fourth time .

a regular at as monaco , the forward netted 11 goals and was the african zone 's top scorer .
his move to arsenal has been rewarded with a place in the champions league final . trainer under the direction of stephen keshi , togo achieved the long-sought success of qualifying for the world cup .
keshi , a former nigerian national team member , took over the position in 2002 when he left his position as co-trainer of the nigerian team after they were sent home from the african nations cup in the semi-final . but a pitiful display of soccer and early elimination from the 2005 africa cup meant the once-hero keshi was given his walking papers .
the togo 's soccer fans are still waiting to see who will be on the bench calling the shots for their team in germany . # b # world cup history germany 2006 is togo 's first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 13 : south korea- togo in frankfurt june 19 : togo - switzerland in dortmund june 23 2006 : togo - france in cologne world cup base togo decided they would stay in the wangen in southern germany during the world cup .

a regular at as monaco , the forward netted 11 goals and was the african zone 's top scorer .
his move to arsenal has been rewarded with a place in the champions league final . trainer under the direction of stephen keshi , togo achieved the long-sought success of qualifying for the world cup .
keshi , a former nigerian national team member , took over the position in 2002 when he left his position as co-trainer of the nigerian team after they were sent home from the african nations cup in the semi-final . but a pitiful display of soccer and early elimination from the 2005 africa cup meant the once-hero keshi was given his walking papers .
the togo 's soccer fans are still waiting to see who will be on the bench calling the shots for their team in germany . # b # world cup history germany 2006 is togo 's first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 13 : south korea- togo in frankfurt june 19 : togo - switzerland in dortmund june 23 2006 : togo - france in cologne world cup base togo decided they would stay in the wangen in southern germany during the world cup .
outlook togo will be the darkest of the dark horses in a group that pits them against france , the obvious group favorite , but the togo 's players wo n't be happy with packing up their yellow and green kits after just three games in their first world cup .
expect togo to arrive in germany in top-form as they will need to rely on a physical , exhausting style in order to beat a group of teams with superior technical skills . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links federation togolaise de football -lrb- ftf -rrb- feedback what do you think of togo 's chances ?

the spanish are among the best club players in the world but tend to choke collectively .
could 2006 be their chance to shine ? world cup qualifiers the upside is that spain did n't lose one single game .
but it still was n't enough for first place in group 7 and direct qualification .
serbia and montenegro made that and spain had to enter the play-offs .
opponent slovakia then did n't have a chance against the spanish , in particular thanks to an impressive 5:1 game in the first leg .
and spain got its world cup ticket . stars the spanish team traditionally has a problem .
it has a lot of stars in its contingent that play brilliantly in clubs such as real madrid or fc barcelona .
but these same players often perform only average in the international team .
raul & co finally want to get past the quarter-finals in the world cup 2006 in germany . trainer old hand luis aragones took up his work at the beginning of the qualifiers .
under his coaching , the team played its way to the world cup .
now , aragones has his eyes on the next goal and that is the final .
the key to reaching this ambitious end is his soccer philosophy : constant possession of the ball and dominating the field . world cup history spain is participating in the world cup for the twelfth time . 1934 : quarter-finals , 1950 : fourth place , 1962 : preliminary round , 1966 : preliminary round , 1978 : preliminary round , 1982 : second round , 1986 : quarter-finals , 1990 : round of 16 , 1994 : quarter-finals , 1998 : preliminary round , 2002 : quarter-finals match schedule : preliminary round june 14 , 2006 : spain - ukraine in leipzig june 19 , 2006 : spain - tunisia in stuttgart june 23 , 2006 : saudi-arabia - spain in kaiserslautern world cup base spain is heading to north rhine-westphalia during the world cup .
the team is setting up its training camp at the college of physical education in kaiserau . outlook the road to germany may have been somewhat cumbersome in the qualifiers , but the spanish are still bursting with self-confidence .
not only trainer aragones has set the final as the team 's goal .
leading players such as raul also think this is by all means realistic .

" all those involved have a duty to look for ways to calm the situation and when i say that , i lay most of the responsibility at the door of iran , which has up to now not only showed no sign of compromise but has consistently taken the wrong path , " steinmeier said .
" this we can not accept , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is still sticking to his guns the deadline set by the un security council expired on friday , a day after hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his nation " will not bow to injustice and pressure . " in a report released in vienna on friday , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei said tehran had failed to comply with the security council 's demand .
his report paves the way for the security council to adopt a resolution legally obliging iran to cooperate with the iaea , the un 's atomic watchdog , and eventually to punish the islamic republic with economic sanctions . germany insists on diplomatic solution steinmeier was speaking to reporters after meeting with his counterpart from oman , yousuf bin alawi bin abdullah , shortly after returning from a nato conference in the bulgarian capital sofia .
he said foreign ministers of the 26-nation transatlantic alliance agreed that the international community should form a strong united front on the iranian nuclear crisis in further deliberations at the security council . " we agreed that in further discussions at the security council , the international community should now stand firm so as to make clear to iran what the negative consequences of self isolation would be . " he added that germany was intent on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff on iran 's nuclear power program , which washington and its allies believe masks a bid to develop atomic weapons . " we remain convinced that only a diplomatic solution can resolve the situation , " steinmeier added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has said a diplomatic solution is the only way forward eu foreign policy chief javier solana also expressed dismay at iran 's failure to comply with the un deadline . " i 'm disappointed that in such a serious situation iran did n't meet the deadline set by the un security council , " solana told german newspaper bild am sonntag .

" all those involved have a duty to look for ways to calm the situation and when i say that , i lay most of the responsibility at the door of iran , which has up to now not only showed no sign of compromise but has consistently taken the wrong path , " steinmeier said .

" in a report released in vienna on friday , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei said tehran had failed to comply with the security council 's demand .
his report paves the way for the security council to adopt a resolution legally obliging iran to cooperate with the iaea , the un 's atomic watchdog , and eventually to punish the islamic republic with economic sanctions . germany insists on diplomatic solution steinmeier was speaking to reporters after meeting with his counterpart from oman , yousuf bin alawi bin abdullah , shortly after returning from a nato conference in the bulgarian capital sofia .
he said foreign ministers of the 26-nation transatlantic alliance agreed that the international community should form a strong united front on the iranian nuclear crisis in further deliberations at the security council . " we agreed that in further discussions at the security council , the international community should now stand firm so as to make clear to iran what the negative consequences of self isolation would be .

saidi added that could mean that iran could continue its controversial uranium-enrichment program , but it would at the same time allow surprise checks of its nuclear facilities . representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council and germany will meet in paris on tuesday to decide the further course of action .

it said it was necessary for teachers to have eye contact with pupils in classes . august gmünd from the local government , which supports the suspension , said the action had caused disruption throughout the school . “ a heated discussion broke out in the school the instant the two girls turned up , not just amongst the kids , but also the teachers , " said gmünd .
" it was just impossible to maintain a controlled environment in the school . ” the girls have been suspended from school for two weeks , for disrupting lessons .
officials say they are welcome to return to school , if they shed their all-enveloping garb .
at the school playground , the appearance of the covered girls confused and annoyed pupils . " provocation " and " fundamentalist character " “ one of the girls was in class with me , " said a student .
" i find it very strange : before the easter holidays , she was personable and outgoing .
now , after the holidays , she turns up in a burka . ” ulrich stahnke , head master at the school in tannenbusch on the outskirts of bonn , said he spent days considering whether to suspend the girls .
he added he and his colleagues had tried to convince them to discard their burkas , without success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say turning up for class like this in germany is a provocation “ for me , this is a new development in central europe , which one is either aware of , or consciously brings into school as a provocation , " stahnke said .
" or , one takes a religious angle with it , which , in a very specific way , has a fundamentalist character . ” the two girls have cited freedom of religion in defense of their outfits .
their families have hired a lawyer , who has yet to issue a statement . " symbolizing female oppression " even those who wear headscarves at the school have little empathy for the girls .
one pupil of kurdish origin , is now campaigning for a completely headscarf free school . “ class 11 and 12 have put together a petition with signatures from classmates who frown on their decision , " she said .
" we also have the full support of the school board .
we think it ’ s out of order to show up at school like this .
as a kurd , and a woman , i feel it ’ s my responsibility to show that this isn ’ t on , and that it symbolizes female oppression . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women were forced by the taliban to cover themselves from head to toe afghanistan 's taliban regime , which was overthrown by u.s.-led forces in late 2001 , introduced a law making it compulsory for all women to wear the garments . not helping integration for head master stahnke , the girls are harming the school ’ s integration policy .
around 30 percent of pupils either come from migrant families , or are themselves migrants .
stahnke said the school ‘ wants to show these children that they can follow their religion without wearing burkas ’ .
he now hopes the girls will participate in counseling sessions with a theological expert , and reconsider their decision . the case follows moves by france , home to europe 's largest islamic minority , to ban islamic headscarves and other " conspicuous religious signs " in state schools in 2004 .
the measures is aimed at stemming what it said was the rising influence of radical islamists among youths . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east berliners oppose mosque germans in a small east berlin neighborhood are protesting plans to build a mosque there .

it said it was necessary for teachers to have eye contact with pupils in classes . august gmünd from the local government , which supports the suspension , said the action had caused disruption throughout the school . “ a heated discussion broke out in the school the instant the two girls turned up , not just amongst the kids , but also the teachers , " said gmünd .
" it was just impossible to maintain a controlled environment in the school . ” the girls have been suspended from school for two weeks , for disrupting lessons .
officials say they are welcome to return to school , if they shed their all-enveloping garb .
at the school playground , the appearance of the covered girls confused and annoyed pupils . " provocation " and " fundamentalist character " “ one of the girls was in class with me , " said a student .
" i find it very strange : before the easter holidays , she was personable and outgoing .
now , after the holidays , she turns up in a burka . ” ulrich stahnke , head master at the school in tannenbusch on the outskirts of bonn , said he spent days considering whether to suspend the girls .
he added he and his colleagues had tried to convince them to discard their burkas , without success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say turning up for class like this in germany is a provocation “ for me , this is a new development in central europe , which one is either aware of , or consciously brings into school as a provocation , " stahnke said .
" or , one takes a religious angle with it , which , in a very specific way , has a fundamentalist character . ” the two girls have cited freedom of religion in defense of their outfits .
their families have hired a lawyer , who has yet to issue a statement . " symbolizing female oppression " even those who wear headscarves at the school have little empathy for the girls .
one pupil of kurdish origin , is now campaigning for a completely headscarf free school . “ class 11 and 12 have put together a petition with signatures from classmates who frown on their decision , " she said .
" we also have the full support of the school board .
we think it ’ s out of order to show up at school like this .
as a kurd , and a woman , i feel it ’ s my responsibility to show that this isn ’ t on , and that it symbolizes female oppression . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women were forced by the taliban to cover themselves from head to toe afghanistan 's taliban regime , which was overthrown by u.s.-led forces in late 2001 , introduced a law making it compulsory for all women to wear the garments . not helping integration for head master stahnke , the girls are harming the school ’ s integration policy .
around 30 percent of pupils either come from migrant families , or are themselves migrants .
stahnke said the school ‘ wants to show these children that they can follow their religion without wearing burkas ’ .
he now hopes the girls will participate in counseling sessions with a theological expert , and reconsider their decision . the case follows moves by france , home to europe 's largest islamic minority , to ban islamic headscarves and other " conspicuous religious signs " in state schools in 2004 .

the move comes after an investigation into the commentator that began over two years ago .
mr limbaugh admitted on air in october 2003 he was addicted to prescription painkillers after florida authorities began an investigation into him .
the problem stemmed from spinal surgery several years ago and he has sought treatment for it , he said .
mr limbaugh , 55 , was charged with illegally obtaining prescriptions , or " doctor shopping " , after presenting himself at the palm beach county sheriff 's office .
he was later released on $ 3,000 -lrb- £ 1,643 -rrb- bail , according to his lawyer , roy black .
deal with prosecutors mr black said his client had filed a written plea of not guilty and denied the charge .
but under a deal with prosecutors , the charge will be dropped in 18 months if mr limbaugh continues to seek treatment for his addiction .
mr limbaugh has also agreed to make a $ 30,000 payment to the state of florida to offset the public cost of the investigation .
" the prosecutors and i agree that there should n't be a criminal prosecution , and we agree there should n't be any court proceedings , " mr black told reuters news agency , adding that his client was pleased the case was over .
" he 's just happy that it 's finally ended and he can go back to his normal life , " he said .
the case attracted widespread attention in 2003 because the popular radio commentator had been a tough critic of drug offenders .

the rescue came after the royal national lifeboat institution -lrb- rnli -rrb- warned boat owners to avoid becoming a statistic over the bank holiday .
rescuers said the owners of the two boats rescued near caernarfon and pwllheli could have caused a disaster .
the rnli launched a record 1,154 times in wales last year , or 15 % up on 2004 .
last weekend the porthdinllaen lifeboat was called out late on saturday to an ex-trawler which was towing another boat , a 28ft -lrb- 8.5m -rrb- cruiser , two miles to the west of porth ysgaden and six miles from porthdinllaen on the llyn peninsula .
rnli wales 2005 1,154 launches , up 15 % on 2004 1,049 people rescued , up from 1,031 in 2004 rhyl was busiest station , with 107 launches and 76 rescues " it was quite rough at the time and we passed a salvage pump onto the first boat because it was taking on water , " said porthdinllaen lifeboat second coxswain robert jones .
the five-strong crew from the birmingham area , who were all on the first boat , agreed to be escorted to porthdinllaen but after the engine of the trawler failed the life boat had to tow both to safety , said mr jones .
by the next morning the boats ' mooring rope had snapped and both the trawler and cruiser were beached at porthdinllaen until high tide on sunday evening .
the trawler and cruiser were beached until high tide some repairs had been made during the day , mr jones said , but the crew got into trouble again later on sunday .
eventually , the cruiser was towed into pwllheli and the trawler managed to complete the journey on its own .
the trawler also had to be rescued last year when it broke down near dinas dinlle outside caernarfon , mr jones said .
" these people were irresponsible .
we do n't mind if people genuinely break down , but these boats were in really bad condition .
this could easily have become a disaster , " said mr jones .
" they had a radio , but when they contacted us the first time they were n't even sure where they were . "
the incident was a week after the rnli warned boat owners that simple checks could prevent unnecessary call outs .
" it 's not only checking your boat to prevent the need for rescue that is important , it is essential to check emergency equipment that you will need should the worst happen , " said nicola davies , rnli divisional sea safety manager .
" wearing lifejackets and having a useable life raft can give you and our lifeboat crews vital minutes should anything go wrong . "
