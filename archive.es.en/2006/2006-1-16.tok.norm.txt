the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso wo n't be pleased with the results the commission says that it is doing its part with its limited means but that member states have to do more . " we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

his parents , leopold and anna maria pertl mozartis , gave him the name johann chrysostom wolfgang theophilus .
his aptitude for music might have come partly from his father , a violinist and composer in his own right who was well known in europe . however , it soon became clear that the young mozart had a talent that outstripped his father 's and he embarked on a composing career that took him to courts and capitals around europe .
he spent a good deal of time in germany .
mozart 's life , however , was fraught with financial difficulty and illness .
often , he received no payment for his work , and the small amounts he did receive were quickly consumed by an extravagant lifestyle .
he died in vienna in 1791 ; he was only 35 years old .
mozart 's tremendous creative output includes works that are pinnacles of symphonic , chamber , piano , operatic and choral music .
many of these are now part of the standard concert repertory and widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style .

but berlin is not about to give up its recent emancipation and its right to say " no " when it wants to .
the grave crisis with iran will be the first test , both have said .
it is an opportunity to put this rapprochement and new willingness to cooperate to the test . " the dutch newspaper trouw expressed great hopes for merkel : " if merkel can build bridges within the eu and sort out the smoldering conflict over eu finances , then she can hopefully also building a transatlantic bridge between the us and a critical europe .
that helps international cooperation in many ways , not only in the fight against terrorism . " the new york times had praise for " a new friend with good advice " : " mrs. merkel could be what washington needs , a european friend with credibility and clout on both sides of the divide back home .
alas , mrs. merkel will most likely not persuade mr. bush to close down guantanamo , but if she can convince him that her advice comes from a friend , the visit will be useful . " the baseler zeitung from switzerland said that the new transatlantic relationship is still open : " exactly what washington 's new relationship to berlin will look like is still rather vague .
the line that the merkel government wo n't cross regarding iraq - no german soldiers - has been accepted .
on the question of iran , it is common knowledge that it could get awkward for any chancellor if the us decides to pursue the military option .
the german mission in afghanistan and in the balkans has been acknowledged … the most visible sign of the new relationship could be if during the next crisis , bush picks up the phone and calls berlin . " the hamburg-based newspaper hamburger abendblatt wrote that the bush-merkel meeting reaffirmed a basic fact : " to the amazement of her critics , the chancellor had sharp words of criticism for the bush 's administration 's sloppy way of dealing with human rights and international law until now .
but despite all the differences of opinion , you ca n't afford to overlook the core of the partnership : in the war against global terrorist networks and aggressive despots , both democracies , the us and germany , are on the same side . " germany 's left-leaning berlin-based daily taz however was of the opinion that the talks between merkel and bush did n't go beyond the usual niceties : " even before angela merkel 's visit in washington , the foreign policy goals were in place : both sides had a great interest in creating a friendly atmosphere for the talks .
certain subjects , especially iran 's nuclear program , could not be delayed and all those involved agreed that a common approach was needed .
it was in front of this background that the friendly television pictures were produced , along with statements that did n't say much of anything . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a very good start " brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2006 european innovation losing out to japan , us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for all of europe 's ambition , it 's still far behind its competitors scandinavia is the best when it comes to innovation in the eu 25 , but offers no competition to worldbeaters america and japan , according to a new study .
the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso wo n't be pleased with the results the commission says that it is doing its part with its limited means but that member states have to do more . " we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

as the german parliament gears up to debate allegations that german secret agents helped us forces during the 2003 war on iraq , former defense minister peter struck has come out and denied the claims . in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , struck dismissed the allegations that german secret agents of the national intelligence service , the bnd , had helped us warplanes to select bombing targets in a war to which the then chancellor gerhard schröder was vehemently and vocally opposed . " i 'm sure the americans knew themselves what targets they wanted to attack , " said struck , who currently heads the social democrat parliamentary group .

13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .

more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .

" we have 17 million hectares of agricultural land in germany and out of that about two million hectares are already used for renewable resources , biomass and bio-energy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming may not be a sexy profession , but it 's a lucrative one a further centerpiece of the green week is a model of a farm that advertises for internships in the 14 so-called " green professions .

but berlin is not about to give up its recent emancipation and its right to say " no " when it wants to .
the grave crisis with iran will be the first test , both have said .
it is an opportunity to put this rapprochement and new willingness to cooperate to the test . " the dutch newspaper trouw expressed great hopes for merkel : " if merkel can build bridges within the eu and sort out the smoldering conflict over eu finances , then she can hopefully also building a transatlantic bridge between the us and a critical europe .
that helps international cooperation in many ways , not only in the fight against terrorism . " the new york times had praise for " a new friend with good advice " : " mrs. merkel could be what washington needs , a european friend with credibility and clout on both sides of the divide back home .
alas , mrs. merkel will most likely not persuade mr. bush to close down guantanamo , but if she can convince him that her advice comes from a friend , the visit will be useful . " the baseler zeitung from switzerland said that the new transatlantic relationship is still open : " exactly what washington 's new relationship to berlin will look like is still rather vague .
the line that the merkel government wo n't cross regarding iraq - no german soldiers - has been accepted .
on the question of iran , it is common knowledge that it could get awkward for any chancellor if the us decides to pursue the military option .
the german mission in afghanistan and in the balkans has been acknowledged … the most visible sign of the new relationship could be if during the next crisis , bush picks up the phone and calls berlin . " the hamburg-based newspaper hamburger abendblatt wrote that the bush-merkel meeting reaffirmed a basic fact : " to the amazement of her critics , the chancellor had sharp words of criticism for the bush 's administration 's sloppy way of dealing with human rights and international law until now .
but despite all the differences of opinion , you ca n't afford to overlook the core of the partnership : in the war against global terrorist networks and aggressive despots , both democracies , the us and germany , are on the same side . " germany 's left-leaning berlin-based daily taz however was of the opinion that the talks between merkel and bush did n't go beyond the usual niceties : " even before angela merkel 's visit in washington , the foreign policy goals were in place : both sides had a great interest in creating a friendly atmosphere for the talks .
certain subjects , especially iran 's nuclear program , could not be delayed and all those involved agreed that a common approach was needed .
it was in front of this background that the friendly television pictures were produced , along with statements that did n't say much of anything .

13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in . " what happened here is ridiculous , " said helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's other big private broadcaster , rtl .
he added that current rules made it virtually impossible for german media companies to get a takeover approved . keeping berlusconi , murdoch away this would lead to takeovers by private equity firms or by people such as italian prime minister and media mogul silvio berlusconi and rupert murdoch , the australian owner of a media empire that includes london 's the times , fox television and sky broadcasting , thoma said . others agreed that german control boards should start thinking about the larger ramifications of their decisions while still ensuring a pluralistic media landscape . " we should use this example to revisit the german procedures and see whether we would not need a more liberal approach , " said jo groebel , the director general of the european institute for the media in dortmund , who also served as a media expert for former chancellor gerhard schröder . caution grounded in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had complete control over the media groebel added that germany has particularly strong controls on media concentration as a result of its experience before and during the nazi period , when the powerful hugenberg publishing empire helped bring the nazis to power , resulting in a state monopoly on the media . but 60 years after the end of world war ii , both kek and cartel office should consider several factors in making their decisions about mergers : the market share of companies on a global rather than just a national level ; traditional media companies versus private equity firms and other companies solely focussed on profit ; and the continuing expansion of the media world beyond the traditional sectors of print , radio and television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german states , represented in the upper house , the bundesrat , should make the first move " one should politically revisit this whole procedure , " groebel said , a sentiment echoed by the media policy spokesman of germany 's ruling christian democrats . " i think it 's appropriate to review our control and security mechanisms , " said wolfgang börnsen , a member of the federal parliament .
but he added that since germany 's states were in charge of media policy , it was up to them to initiate this . there 's a good chance it will happen : several leading state politicians have sharply criticized the kek 's rejection of the springer deal . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in . " what happened here is ridiculous , " said helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's other big private broadcaster , rtl .
he added that current rules made it virtually impossible for german media companies to get a takeover approved . keeping berlusconi , murdoch away this would lead to takeovers by private equity firms or by people such as italian prime minister and media mogul silvio berlusconi and rupert murdoch , the australian owner of a media empire that includes london 's the times , fox television and sky broadcasting , thoma said . others agreed that german control boards should start thinking about the larger ramifications of their decisions while still ensuring a pluralistic media landscape . " we should use this example to revisit the german procedures and see whether we would not need a more liberal approach , " said jo groebel , the director general of the european institute for the media in dortmund , who also served as a media expert for former chancellor gerhard schröder . caution grounded in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had complete control over the media groebel added that germany has particularly strong controls on media concentration as a result of its experience before and during the nazi period , when the powerful hugenberg publishing empire helped bring the nazis to power , resulting in a state monopoly on the media . but 60 years after the end of world war ii , both kek and cartel office should consider several factors in making their decisions about mergers : the market share of companies on a global rather than just a national level ; traditional media companies versus private equity firms and other companies solely focussed on profit ; and the continuing expansion of the media world beyond the traditional sectors of print , radio and television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german states , represented in the upper house , the bundesrat , should make the first move " one should politically revisit this whole procedure , " groebel said , a sentiment echoed by the media policy spokesman of germany 's ruling christian democrats . " i think it 's appropriate to review our control and security mechanisms , " said wolfgang börnsen , a member of the federal parliament .
but he added that since germany 's states were in charge of media policy , it was up to them to initiate this . there 's a good chance it will happen : several leading state politicians have sharply criticized the kek 's rejection of the springer deal . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through .

his parents , leopold and anna maria pertl mozartis , gave him the name johann chrysostom wolfgang theophilus .
his aptitude for music might have come partly from his father , a violinist and composer in his own right who was well known in europe . however , it soon became clear that the young mozart had a talent that outstripped his father 's and he embarked on a composing career that took him to courts and capitals around europe .
he spent a good deal of time in germany .
mozart 's life , however , was fraught with financial difficulty and illness .
often , he received no payment for his work , and the small amounts he did receive were quickly consumed by an extravagant lifestyle .
he died in vienna in 1791 ; he was only 35 years old .
mozart 's tremendous creative output includes works that are pinnacles of symphonic , chamber , piano , operatic and choral music .
many of these are now part of the standard concert repertory and widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm . " i can understand that some people in my party are a little nervous , because the chancellor is receiving the credit for many things , " he told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper .
" but i 'm not worried .
it 's quite clear that the chancellor will reap the benefits at first .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .

but as a new musical in the city of dresden shows , they have never been accepted . the aptly-named production " hartz iv - the musical , " which premiered to an eager audience on friday evening , is set in an employment office somewhere , but nowhere in particular , in germany .
against a backdrop of gray walls , time , and even life itself appears to stand still .
a notice board is starkly devoid of any information and seven people wait their turn to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " author and director erik gedeon , who confesses his own fear of being unemployed , says the aim of the musical is to show what being out of work can mean to the individuals concerned , and to underscore the reality that any one of us can fall victim to joblessness . gedeon 's characters appear lost in their own worlds , none of them remotely interested in the fate of the others around them .
when they do communicate with one another , it is through song , to melodies from musical hits such as " west side story , " " cats , " " hair " or " jesus christ superstar . " no knock-on political effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " the director and former artistic director of hamburg 's thalia theater , says he made a conscious decision not to compose any new music for his topical production , in order to be true to the subject matter .
" the distinguishing feature of hartz iv is that it forces people to live from what 's left , " gedeon told reporters . he rejects any notion that his musical makes fun of those affected by the labor reforms .
" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .

if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .

" merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .

if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working .

this time 1,600 exhibitors from 53 nations are adding to the boom . fears over the unfolding bird flu virus in turkey have also spilled over to the annual green week fair in berlin , which began last friday , jan .
13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .
visitors can wander through a carpet of daffodils and crocuses , a mediterranean garden with 2,000 aroma herbs or marvel at a sea of 25,000 flower types .
more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .
the biggest foreign exhibitor and at the same time partner country of the green week this year is russia .
for the first time , the 22 regions of the vast country stretching from the baltic sea to siberia are exhibiting their culinary specialties . in addition new eu members such as estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovenia , the czech republic and hungary as well as eu aspirants bulgaria and romania and other eastern european countries are also visible in full force . almost two thirds of exhibition space is taken up by the food industry .
in germany , the sector with its 6,000 companies and more than half a million employees is one of the biggest industries . " the turnover of the food industry in germany rose in 2005 by 3.3 percent to 134.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- , " said jürgen abraham , chairman of the federal association of the german food industry . exports are a vital part of it .
last year , processed german foodstuffs sold abroad raked in an estimated 29.7 billion euros - amounting to a fifth of the total turnover . farms are big business the food industry 's presence at the green week is largely in the form of regional and international specialties , dominated by wine , beer , cigars and digestives .
agriculture too is another important focus with special exhibitions on organic farming and renewable resources . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association said that germany played a leading role in europe when it came to organic farming and energy-saving agricultural methods . " we have 17 million hectares of agricultural land in germany and out of that about two million hectares are already used for renewable resources , biomass and bio-energy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming may not be a sexy profession , but it 's a lucrative one a further centerpiece of the green week is a model of a farm that advertises for internships in the 14 so-called " green professions . "
over 40,000 interns are currently estimated to be undergoing training in farming professions and a further 30,000 are training to be butchers , bakers and confectioners . the green week also makes apparent the importance enjoyed by the agriculture and food industry in germany 's economy .
some 11 percent of those holding a job in the country are directly or indirectly involved in the food and farming business . the so-called " agribusiness " sector is said to have a annual turnover of a whopping 500 billion euros . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan recent meat scandals at home have benefited the organic food industry in germany , a country which can rightly claim to be europe 's largest consumer of bio-foods .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .

" we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

as the german parliament gears up to debate allegations that german secret agents helped us forces during the 2003 war on iraq , former defense minister peter struck has come out and denied the claims . in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , struck dismissed the allegations that german secret agents of the national intelligence service , the bnd , had helped us warplanes to select bombing targets in a war to which the then chancellor gerhard schröder was vehemently and vocally opposed . " i 'm sure the americans knew themselves what targets they wanted to attack , " said struck , who currently heads the social democrat parliamentary group .
" they did n't need any directions .
apart from the fact that we granted the americans flyover rights and that german soldiers guarded us facilities -lrb- in germany -rrb- , the government maintained its line that we did not take an active part in this war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like schröder , millions of germans were opposed to the war although the current government has confirmed that two german agents remained in baghdad during the 2003 invasion , it said their presence was in order to provide the government with first-hand information about the war adding that they gave us forces details of buildings to avoid such as schools or hospitals . " no double standards " on monday , the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief-of-staff and as such in charge of overseeing the intelligence services at the time in question , told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper that the intelligence agents had not supported the us invasion . " if we were able to prevent an embassy or a hospital from being hit , then that has nothing to do with double standards , " the foreign minister said .
he added that some people were now trying to re-write history , but that neither he nor his party would allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier has come under pressure from opposition politicians to resign if it transpires that german agents did in fact help the us in its war mission .
he has rejected calls for his resignation , saying that the " question does n't arise . " the weekly news magazine der spiegel said the bnd agents might have cooperated with the us forces without realizing that the information they provided was actually giving the americans valuable indications about targets or troop movements . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2006 eu-3 call for iaea action over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe seems to be losing patience with iran 's president europe 's leading nations pressed monday for an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog in two weeks over iran 's nuclear program , bringing the prospect of referral to the un security council a step closer . after talks in london that also included officials from china , russia and united states , the eu troika of britain , france and germany said they wanted the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to meet on feb .
2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in . " what happened here is ridiculous , " said helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's other big private broadcaster , rtl .
he added that current rules made it virtually impossible for german media companies to get a takeover approved . keeping berlusconi , murdoch away this would lead to takeovers by private equity firms or by people such as italian prime minister and media mogul silvio berlusconi and rupert murdoch , the australian owner of a media empire that includes london 's the times , fox television and sky broadcasting , thoma said . others agreed that german control boards should start thinking about the larger ramifications of their decisions while still ensuring a pluralistic media landscape . " we should use this example to revisit the german procedures and see whether we would not need a more liberal approach , " said jo groebel , the director general of the european institute for the media in dortmund , who also served as a media expert for former chancellor gerhard schröder . caution grounded in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had complete control over the media groebel added that germany has particularly strong controls on media concentration as a result of its experience before and during the nazi period , when the powerful hugenberg publishing empire helped bring the nazis to power , resulting in a state monopoly on the media . but 60 years after the end of world war ii , both kek and cartel office should consider several factors in making their decisions about mergers : the market share of companies on a global rather than just a national level ; traditional media companies versus private equity firms and other companies solely focussed on profit ; and the continuing expansion of the media world beyond the traditional sectors of print , radio and television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german states , represented in the upper house , the bundesrat , should make the first move " one should politically revisit this whole procedure , " groebel said , a sentiment echoed by the media policy spokesman of germany 's ruling christian democrats . " i think it 's appropriate to review our control and security mechanisms , " said wolfgang börnsen , a member of the federal parliament .
but he added that since germany 's states were in charge of media policy , it was up to them to initiate this . there 's a good chance it will happen : several leading state politicians have sharply criticized the kek 's rejection of the springer deal . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through .

his parents , leopold and anna maria pertl mozartis , gave him the name johann chrysostom wolfgang theophilus .
his aptitude for music might have come partly from his father , a violinist and composer in his own right who was well known in europe . however , it soon became clear that the young mozart had a talent that outstripped his father 's and he embarked on a composing career that took him to courts and capitals around europe .
he spent a good deal of time in germany .
mozart 's life , however , was fraught with financial difficulty and illness .
often , he received no payment for his work , and the small amounts he did receive were quickly consumed by an extravagant lifestyle .
he died in vienna in 1791 ; he was only 35 years old .
mozart 's tremendous creative output includes works that are pinnacles of symphonic , chamber , piano , operatic and choral music .
many of these are now part of the standard concert repertory and widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .

but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm . " i can understand that some people in my party are a little nervous , because the chancellor is receiving the credit for many things , " he told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper .
" but i 'm not worried .
it 's quite clear that the chancellor will reap the benefits at first .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm .

were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm . " i can understand that some people in my party are a little nervous , because the chancellor is receiving the credit for many things , " he told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper .
" but i 'm not worried .
it 's quite clear that the chancellor will reap the benefits at first .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .

on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

27 , 1756 , he 's getting his own celebratory year . throughout the next 12 months , events will be held feting the austrian genius , who at three years of age was picking out chords on the harpsichord , at four playing short pieces and began composing at the tender age of five .
his parents , leopold and anna maria pertl mozartis , gave him the name johann chrysostom wolfgang theophilus .
his aptitude for music might have come partly from his father , a violinist and composer in his own right who was well known in europe . however , it soon became clear that the young mozart had a talent that outstripped his father 's and he embarked on a composing career that took him to courts and capitals around europe .
he spent a good deal of time in germany .
mozart 's life , however , was fraught with financial difficulty and illness .
often , he received no payment for his work , and the small amounts he did receive were quickly consumed by an extravagant lifestyle .
he died in vienna in 1791 ; he was only 35 years old .
mozart 's tremendous creative output includes works that are pinnacles of symphonic , chamber , piano , operatic and choral music .
many of these are now part of the standard concert repertory and widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .

but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .

" japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take .

as the german parliament gears up to debate allegations that german secret agents helped us forces during the 2003 war on iraq , former defense minister peter struck has come out and denied the claims . in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , struck dismissed the allegations that german secret agents of the national intelligence service , the bnd , had helped us warplanes to select bombing targets in a war to which the then chancellor gerhard schröder was vehemently and vocally opposed .

as the german parliament gears up to debate allegations that german secret agents helped us forces during the 2003 war on iraq , former defense minister peter struck has come out and denied the claims . in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , struck dismissed the allegations that german secret agents of the national intelligence service , the bnd , had helped us warplanes to select bombing targets in a war to which the then chancellor gerhard schröder was vehemently and vocally opposed . " i 'm sure the americans knew themselves what targets they wanted to attack , " said struck , who currently heads the social democrat parliamentary group .

" no double standards " on monday , the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief-of-staff and as such in charge of overseeing the intelligence services at the time in question , told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper that the intelligence agents had not supported the us invasion . " if we were able to prevent an embassy or a hospital from being hit , then that has nothing to do with double standards , " the foreign minister said .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm .

as the german parliament gears up to debate allegations that german secret agents helped us forces during the 2003 war on iraq , former defense minister peter struck has come out and denied the claims . in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , struck dismissed the allegations that german secret agents of the national intelligence service , the bnd , had helped us warplanes to select bombing targets in a war to which the then chancellor gerhard schröder was vehemently and vocally opposed . " i 'm sure the americans knew themselves what targets they wanted to attack , " said struck , who currently heads the social democrat parliamentary group .
" they did n't need any directions .
apart from the fact that we granted the americans flyover rights and that german soldiers guarded us facilities -lrb- in germany -rrb- , the government maintained its line that we did not take an active part in this war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like schröder , millions of germans were opposed to the war although the current government has confirmed that two german agents remained in baghdad during the 2003 invasion , it said their presence was in order to provide the government with first-hand information about the war adding that they gave us forces details of buildings to avoid such as schools or hospitals . " no double standards " on monday , the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief-of-staff and as such in charge of overseeing the intelligence services at the time in question , told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper that the intelligence agents had not supported the us invasion . " if we were able to prevent an embassy or a hospital from being hit , then that has nothing to do with double standards , " the foreign minister said .
he added that some people were now trying to re-write history , but that neither he nor his party would allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier has come under pressure from opposition politicians to resign if it transpires that german agents did in fact help the us in its war mission .
he has rejected calls for his resignation , saying that the " question does n't arise . " the weekly news magazine der spiegel said the bnd agents might have cooperated with the us forces without realizing that the information they provided was actually giving the americans valuable indications about targets or troop movements . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .

beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .

this time 1,600 exhibitors from 53 nations are adding to the boom . fears over the unfolding bird flu virus in turkey have also spilled over to the annual green week fair in berlin , which began last friday , jan .
13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .

more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .

in germany , the sector with its 6,000 companies and more than half a million employees is one of the biggest industries . " the turnover of the food industry in germany rose in 2005 by 3.3 percent to 134.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- , " said jürgen abraham , chairman of the federal association of the german food industry . exports are a vital part of it .
last year , processed german foodstuffs sold abroad raked in an estimated 29.7 billion euros - amounting to a fifth of the total turnover . farms are big business the food industry 's presence at the green week is largely in the form of regional and international specialties , dominated by wine , beer , cigars and digestives .
agriculture too is another important focus with special exhibitions on organic farming and renewable resources . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association said that germany played a leading role in europe when it came to organic farming and energy-saving agricultural methods . " we have 17 million hectares of agricultural land in germany and out of that about two million hectares are already used for renewable resources , biomass and bio-energy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming may not be a sexy profession , but it 's a lucrative one a further centerpiece of the green week is a model of a farm that advertises for internships in the 14 so-called " green professions . "
over 40,000 interns are currently estimated to be undergoing training in farming professions and a further 30,000 are training to be butchers , bakers and confectioners . the green week also makes apparent the importance enjoyed by the agriculture and food industry in germany 's economy .
some 11 percent of those holding a job in the country are directly or indirectly involved in the food and farming business . the so-called " agribusiness " sector is said to have a annual turnover of a whopping 500 billion euros . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan recent meat scandals at home have benefited the organic food industry in germany , a country which can rightly claim to be europe 's largest consumer of bio-foods .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .

but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .

" we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso wo n't be pleased with the results the commission says that it is doing its part with its limited means but that member states have to do more . " we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.01.2006 putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin urged care over iran while merkel hoped for a more concrete response german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm . " i can understand that some people in my party are a little nervous , because the chancellor is receiving the credit for many things , " he told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper .
" but i 'm not worried .
it 's quite clear that the chancellor will reap the benefits at first .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm .

the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .

local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .

beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .

13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in . " what happened here is ridiculous , " said helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's other big private broadcaster , rtl .
he added that current rules made it virtually impossible for german media companies to get a takeover approved . keeping berlusconi , murdoch away this would lead to takeovers by private equity firms or by people such as italian prime minister and media mogul silvio berlusconi and rupert murdoch , the australian owner of a media empire that includes london 's the times , fox television and sky broadcasting , thoma said . others agreed that german control boards should start thinking about the larger ramifications of their decisions while still ensuring a pluralistic media landscape . " we should use this example to revisit the german procedures and see whether we would not need a more liberal approach , " said jo groebel , the director general of the european institute for the media in dortmund , who also served as a media expert for former chancellor gerhard schröder . caution grounded in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had complete control over the media groebel added that germany has particularly strong controls on media concentration as a result of its experience before and during the nazi period , when the powerful hugenberg publishing empire helped bring the nazis to power , resulting in a state monopoly on the media . but 60 years after the end of world war ii , both kek and cartel office should consider several factors in making their decisions about mergers : the market share of companies on a global rather than just a national level ; traditional media companies versus private equity firms and other companies solely focussed on profit ; and the continuing expansion of the media world beyond the traditional sectors of print , radio and television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german states , represented in the upper house , the bundesrat , should make the first move " one should politically revisit this whole procedure , " groebel said , a sentiment echoed by the media policy spokesman of germany 's ruling christian democrats . " i think it 's appropriate to review our control and security mechanisms , " said wolfgang börnsen , a member of the federal parliament .
but he added that since germany 's states were in charge of media policy , it was up to them to initiate this . there 's a good chance it will happen : several leading state politicians have sharply criticized the kek 's rejection of the springer deal . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through .

this time 1,600 exhibitors from 53 nations are adding to the boom . fears over the unfolding bird flu virus in turkey have also spilled over to the annual green week fair in berlin , which began last friday , jan .
13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .
visitors can wander through a carpet of daffodils and crocuses , a mediterranean garden with 2,000 aroma herbs or marvel at a sea of 25,000 flower types .
more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .
the biggest foreign exhibitor and at the same time partner country of the green week this year is russia .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .
" we russians are the greatest partisans for the development of democracy " in russia , he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stable relationship with russia a priority for merkel on the heels of her first trip to washington as chancellor , angela merkel embarks on a similar official visit to russia monday , where she will meet with president vladimir putin .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .

beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

this time 1,600 exhibitors from 53 nations are adding to the boom . fears over the unfolding bird flu virus in turkey have also spilled over to the annual green week fair in berlin , which began last friday , jan .
13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .
visitors can wander through a carpet of daffodils and crocuses , a mediterranean garden with 2,000 aroma herbs or marvel at a sea of 25,000 flower types .
more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .

in germany , the sector with its 6,000 companies and more than half a million employees is one of the biggest industries . " the turnover of the food industry in germany rose in 2005 by 3.3 percent to 134.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- , " said jürgen abraham , chairman of the federal association of the german food industry . exports are a vital part of it .

agriculture too is another important focus with special exhibitions on organic farming and renewable resources . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association said that germany played a leading role in europe when it came to organic farming and energy-saving agricultural methods . " we have 17 million hectares of agricultural land in germany and out of that about two million hectares are already used for renewable resources , biomass and bio-energy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming may not be a sexy profession , but it 's a lucrative one a further centerpiece of the green week is a model of a farm that advertises for internships in the 14 so-called " green professions . "
over 40,000 interns are currently estimated to be undergoing training in farming professions and a further 30,000 are training to be butchers , bakers and confectioners . the green week also makes apparent the importance enjoyed by the agriculture and food industry in germany 's economy .
some 11 percent of those holding a job in the country are directly or indirectly involved in the food and farming business . the so-called " agribusiness " sector is said to have a annual turnover of a whopping 500 billion euros . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan recent meat scandals at home have benefited the organic food industry in germany , a country which can rightly claim to be europe 's largest consumer of bio-foods .

" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

this time 1,600 exhibitors from 53 nations are adding to the boom . fears over the unfolding bird flu virus in turkey have also spilled over to the annual green week fair in berlin , which began last friday , jan .
13 . at the entrance to the massive fair halls , a huge sign warns about avian flu and other epidemics caused by animals . that does n't mean that animals are n't part of the 80th international green week .
this time about 3,000 bees , 4,000 fish and a further 3,000 domestic and livestock animals are part of the attraction .
but , this year they 've all had to undergo stringent controls , said christian göke , head of the fair halls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not real cows , but a giant cow poster at the green week .
" everything that 's alive had to be examined by a specialist veterinarian five days before the fair began , " göke said .
" that is , i believe , the highest possible standard that you can implement . " göke added that there were no indications during the examinations of anything suspicious . boom time despite the unease over a possible outbreak of bird flu in europe , the green week is booming this year like never before .
in the 80th year of its existence , the green week remains the world 's largest food and agriculture fair . and this time , horticulture is a huge part of the attraction .
visitors can wander through a carpet of daffodils and crocuses , a mediterranean garden with 2,000 aroma herbs or marvel at a sea of 25,000 flower types .
more than 1,600 exhibitors from 53 countries have made their way to berlin this year to showcase their produce . " the halls are packed to capacity this year , we had to build an additional temporary one at the back next to the animal stalls in order to fill the demand for further space , " göke said . spotlight on russia the fair began in 1926 as a simple commodity exchange service for farmers and local traders and has grown by leaps and bounds over the years .
more than 30 million visitors have attended the fair since its inception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural minister seehofer -lrb- center -rrb- with his austrian and russian counterparts this time two thirds of all exhibitors are from germany .

in germany , the sector with its 6,000 companies and more than half a million employees is one of the biggest industries . " the turnover of the food industry in germany rose in 2005 by 3.3 percent to 134.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- , " said jürgen abraham , chairman of the federal association of the german food industry . exports are a vital part of it .
last year , processed german foodstuffs sold abroad raked in an estimated 29.7 billion euros - amounting to a fifth of the total turnover . farms are big business the food industry 's presence at the green week is largely in the form of regional and international specialties , dominated by wine , beer , cigars and digestives .
agriculture too is another important focus with special exhibitions on organic farming and renewable resources . gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' association said that germany played a leading role in europe when it came to organic farming and energy-saving agricultural methods . " we have 17 million hectares of agricultural land in germany and out of that about two million hectares are already used for renewable resources , biomass and bio-energy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming may not be a sexy profession , but it 's a lucrative one a further centerpiece of the green week is a model of a farm that advertises for internships in the 14 so-called " green professions .

over 40,000 interns are currently estimated to be undergoing training in farming professions and a further 30,000 are training to be butchers , bakers and confectioners . the green week also makes apparent the importance enjoyed by the agriculture and food industry in germany 's economy .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .
they will provide the first indication of voter sentiment since the federal ballot last september failed to produce a clear winner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's conservatives are taking a family-friendly approach the conservatives , who have adopted the party slogan " new fairness " for the upcoming polls , are campaigning hard on an agenda of social issues such as affordable child care and tax breaks for families .
they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm . " i can understand that some people in my party are a little nervous , because the chancellor is receiving the credit for many things , " he told sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper .

but as a new musical in the city of dresden shows , they have never been accepted . the aptly-named production " hartz iv - the musical , " which premiered to an eager audience on friday evening , is set in an employment office somewhere , but nowhere in particular , in germany .
against a backdrop of gray walls , time , and even life itself appears to stand still .

when they do communicate with one another , it is through song , to melodies from musical hits such as " west side story , " " cats , " " hair " or " jesus christ superstar . " no knock-on political effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " the director and former artistic director of hamburg 's thalia theater , says he made a conscious decision not to compose any new music for his topical production , in order to be true to the subject matter .
" the distinguishing feature of hartz iv is that it forces people to live from what 's left , " gedeon told reporters . he rejects any notion that his musical makes fun of those affected by the labor reforms .
" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

but as a new musical in the city of dresden shows , they have never been accepted . the aptly-named production " hartz iv - the musical , " which premiered to an eager audience on friday evening , is set in an employment office somewhere , but nowhere in particular , in germany .
against a backdrop of gray walls , time , and even life itself appears to stand still .
a notice board is starkly devoid of any information and seven people wait their turn to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " author and director erik gedeon , who confesses his own fear of being unemployed , says the aim of the musical is to show what being out of work can mean to the individuals concerned , and to underscore the reality that any one of us can fall victim to joblessness . gedeon 's characters appear lost in their own worlds , none of them remotely interested in the fate of the others around them .
when they do communicate with one another , it is through song , to melodies from musical hits such as " west side story , " " cats , " " hair " or " jesus christ superstar . " no knock-on political effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " the director and former artistic director of hamburg 's thalia theater , says he made a conscious decision not to compose any new music for his topical production , in order to be true to the subject matter .
" the distinguishing feature of hartz iv is that it forces people to live from what 's left , " gedeon told reporters . he rejects any notion that his musical makes fun of those affected by the labor reforms .
" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in . " what happened here is ridiculous , " said helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's other big private broadcaster , rtl .
he added that current rules made it virtually impossible for german media companies to get a takeover approved . keeping berlusconi , murdoch away this would lead to takeovers by private equity firms or by people such as italian prime minister and media mogul silvio berlusconi and rupert murdoch , the australian owner of a media empire that includes london 's the times , fox television and sky broadcasting , thoma said . others agreed that german control boards should start thinking about the larger ramifications of their decisions while still ensuring a pluralistic media landscape . " we should use this example to revisit the german procedures and see whether we would not need a more liberal approach , " said jo groebel , the director general of the european institute for the media in dortmund , who also served as a media expert for former chancellor gerhard schröder . caution grounded in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had complete control over the media groebel added that germany has particularly strong controls on media concentration as a result of its experience before and during the nazi period , when the powerful hugenberg publishing empire helped bring the nazis to power , resulting in a state monopoly on the media . but 60 years after the end of world war ii , both kek and cartel office should consider several factors in making their decisions about mergers : the market share of companies on a global rather than just a national level ; traditional media companies versus private equity firms and other companies solely focussed on profit ; and the continuing expansion of the media world beyond the traditional sectors of print , radio and television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german states , represented in the upper house , the bundesrat , should make the first move " one should politically revisit this whole procedure , " groebel said , a sentiment echoed by the media policy spokesman of germany 's ruling christian democrats . " i think it 's appropriate to review our control and security mechanisms , " said wolfgang börnsen , a member of the federal parliament .
but he added that since germany 's states were in charge of media policy , it was up to them to initiate this . there 's a good chance it will happen : several leading state politicians have sharply criticized the kek 's rejection of the springer deal . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .

but they 're unlikely to come from the company 's own tv channels as springer 's plans to buy germany 's largest private broadcaster , prosiebensat.1 , seem set for failure . after months of negotiations with germany medial control and antitrust authorities , springer officials announced monday that they had withdrawn an offer to sell the prosieben channel if they are allowed to keep three others that belong to the group - sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 . bildunterschrift : soon to be installed atop springer 's skyscraper ? the federal cartel office , which is due to announce its final decision on the takeover by the end of the week , had signalled support for such a compromise , but springer said they were legal impediments to pursue this option . germany 's so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- had already vetoed the original merger plans last week , saying that the company would hold too large a share of the market . no need for change ? some experts said the rejection showed that germany 's monopoly control mechanisms were working . " we applaud the fact that the original proposal was rejected , " said hendrik zörner , the spokesman of the german journalists ' association , adding that it remained to be seen whether the cartel office 's final decision would be made with press pluralism in mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under thoma , rtl became germany 's most successful private tv channel others , however , called springer 's compromise proposal an " act of desperation " and urged a general review of control mechanisms to allow german media companies to expand domestically and prevent foreign firms without any media background from coming in .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.01.2006 putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin urged care over iran while merkel hoped for a more concrete response german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .
" we russians are the greatest partisans for the development of democracy " in russia , he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stable relationship with russia a priority for merkel on the heels of her first trip to washington as chancellor , angela merkel embarks on a similar official visit to russia monday , where she will meet with president vladimir putin .

the eu 's executive arm is concerned . the nordic countries are the most innovative in europe but most of the economically embattled continent is failing to catch up with the united states and japan , the european commission said thursday . denmark , sweden and finland lead europe in innovation while germany and switzerland also got high marks in the latest scoreboard from the european union 's executive arm . the study , the fifth of its kind by the commission , ranked most european countries as well as the united states , japan and turkey according to 26 criteria such as research spending , access to venture capital and the number of trademark registrations . worrying trend , increasing gap most of the eu 's older member states were lumped in the middle of the ranking neither falling behind nor making much progress advancing up the innovation ladder .
europe 's poorer eastern countries , many of which joined the eu in 2004 , put in a mixed performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavians lead europe in innovation , but are still far behind america and japan the czech republic , cyprus , greece , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , portugal and slovenia were seen catching up while bulgaria , estonia , poland , romania , slovakia , turkey but also spain were losing ground .
but the commission warned that europe was broadly not catching up with the united states and that action needed to taken to boost innovation . " should the trend continue in terms of innovation in the 25 european union member states the innovation gap we have been seeing in the last year between europe and united states for example will not close , " commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber told journalists . " this is obviously something which is in political terms a very clear message and a clear analysis that we have to take very seriously in terms of drawing the necessary and correct political conclusions , " he added . japan could bring serious competition the study showed that although the innovation gap between the united states and europe was wide overall it was not getting any wider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan could rise again however , that was not the case for japan . " japan has been moving its innovation on , and if they get their economy moving again they will be a very aggressive competitor for us and we need to be prepared for that , " said the head of the commission 's industry department , david white . eu policymakers have been struggling for years to live up to their dreams of boosting europe 's capacity to innovate and catch up with japan and the united states , which plows a third more into research than the european bloc .
ambitious program , but results lacking last year , eu members states watered down an ambitious programme to boost the eu 's competitiveness after they consistently failed to meet the original targets when it was launched in 2000 in lisbon with the aim to make the eu the most competitive economy in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso wo n't be pleased with the results the commission says that it is doing its part with its limited means but that member states have to do more . " we are trying to do on the european union 's end as much as we can but on the other part is what the member states have to on their end , " the commission spokesman said . the commission unveiled an " action plan " last october that proposed refocusing state aid , improving intellectual property rights , setting up specialized business clusters , drumming up more funds for research and boosting university-industry partnerships . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible . " state and local politicians , who see fit to grumble , should make their own contribution to child-friendliness , " she said .
" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .
reduce kindergarten costs , or better still , dispense with them altogether . " great idea , in theory the general response has been that it is a nice thought which will never be more than that .
local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .
were those contributions reduced , or abolished outright , there would be less money to inject into increasing the number of kindergarten places available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat state premiere for rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck kurt beck , the social democratic state premier of the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , told public broadcasters ard and zdf that he was not prepared to pass the financial buck to local and church authorities .
he advised von der leyen to pay for any improvements out of her own coffers rather than tell other people how to spend their money .
beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

they are hoping to marginalize the spd in the process .
and although the cdu approach has set the cat among the pigeons in the ranks of the social democrats , former defense minister and spd parliamentary party leader , party struck , has called for calm .

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2006 eu-3 call for iaea action over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe seems to be losing patience with iran 's president europe 's leading nations pressed monday for an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog in two weeks over iran 's nuclear program , bringing the prospect of referral to the un security council a step closer . after talks in london that also included officials from china , russia and united states , the eu troika of britain , france and germany said they wanted the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to meet on feb .
2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "
oil prices rise fears over the rumbling crisis have sent global oil prices rising .
in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible . " " the problem with waiting for the regular meeting in march or waiting for a long time is that i think the iranians will try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate " on its intentions , she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .

in london , the price of north sea crude oil jumped 76 cents to $ 63.02 per barrel in monday 's trade .
us markets were closed for a holiday . the diplomatic source , however , stressed that sanctions , while possible , were by no means a certainty .
" there are plenty of examples where a matter is referred to the security council and the security council takes action and that action is followed without sanction , " the source said . in moscow , president vladimir putin cautioned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran and stressed that a long-mooted compromise plan to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory was still possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in moscow on monday " the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " putin said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel . britain , france and germany , known as the eu-3 , have spearheaded the bloc 's negotiations with iran , trying to woo the islamic republic with pledges of more aid and trade in return for greater candor on its nuclear program .
on thursday , the troika , furious at iran breaking the seals on nuclear facilities to resume fuel work , declared the talks were at a " dead end " and said they would seek an iaea meeting to debate referral . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , en route to liberia , said monday she wanted to see the board of the iaea convene " as soon as possible .

2-3 . " the eu-3 informed the other participants of their intention to call for an extraordinary iaea board of governors meeting on the second and third of february , " a british foreign office spokesman told afp . the london gathering followed iran 's announcement last week that it was to resume research into uranium enrichment , sparking worldwide concern . iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian energy purposes , but highly enriched uranium can also be used as the raw material for nuclear weapons - something the west fears tehran is secretly trying to develop .
lesser measure more likely the iaea governors could decide to refer iran to the un security council for contravening nuclear non-proliferation agreements and iaea resolutions , in a possible prelude to sanctions .
however , a lesser measure such as a formal order for tehran to halt nuclear research appears more likely , with british foreign secretary jack straw saying earlier monday that there was no need to " rush " towards sanctions . russia and china , both of which have close trade and energy ties with iran , are also seen as notably less keen on sanctions than the united states and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrated during talks in berlin last week over the weekend , tehran declared that it was " not scared " by the prospect of un referral . the foreign office spokesman said all sides in monday 's talks had expressed " serious concern " about iran 's move but talked only of " a thorough exchange of views on the role of the un security council " in enforcing the iaea 's views .
" the participants remain committed to a diplomatic solution , " the spokesman added . a european diplomatic source , speaking under cover of anonymity , had earlier monday described referral to the security council as a certainty . " the russians are agreed now .
they have changed their position , " said the source .
" the chinese are still a little hesitant , but effectively a security council referral is now a done deal . "

she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take . angela merkel arrived on her first visit to russia since becoming german chancellor monday hoping to use the " strategic partnership " between the two countries to persuade president vladimir putin to join the european union and the united states in pressuring iran . while other topics such as energy collaborations and human rights were breached , the most pressing subject of merkel 's three-hour discussions with putin was the escalating iranian nuclear crisis .
emerging from the talks , the russian president gave little away about what action his country would be supporting . " as for russia , and germany , and our european partners and the united states - we have very close positions on the iranian problem , " president putin said at the joint press conference after the talks . but he warned against taking " abrupt " steps over iran 's nuclear ambitions and said tehran had not ruled out a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian territory . putin says move carefully " we need to move very carefully in this area .
i personally do not allow myself a single careless announcement and do not allow the foreign ministry to make a single uncertain step , " he said .
" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .

but as a new musical in the city of dresden shows , they have never been accepted . the aptly-named production " hartz iv - the musical , " which premiered to an eager audience on friday evening , is set in an employment office somewhere , but nowhere in particular , in germany .
against a backdrop of gray walls , time , and even life itself appears to stand still .
a notice board is starkly devoid of any information and seven people wait their turn to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " author and director erik gedeon , who confesses his own fear of being unemployed , says the aim of the musical is to show what being out of work can mean to the individuals concerned , and to underscore the reality that any one of us can fall victim to joblessness . gedeon 's characters appear lost in their own worlds , none of them remotely interested in the fate of the others around them .
when they do communicate with one another , it is through song , to melodies from musical hits such as " west side story , " " cats , " " hair " or " jesus christ superstar . " no knock-on political effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " the director and former artistic director of hamburg 's thalia theater , says he made a conscious decision not to compose any new music for his topical production , in order to be true to the subject matter .
" the distinguishing feature of hartz iv is that it forces people to live from what 's left , " gedeon told reporters . he rejects any notion that his musical makes fun of those affected by the labor reforms .
" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

" in any event , we must work on the iranian problem very carefully , not allowing abrupt , erroneous steps . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still hopes that further discussions will lead to an agreement merkel , who announced another meeting with putin would take place in the siberian town of tomsk in april , said that further discussions were needed on iran .
" with the next steps we take , the closer we will be to an agreement , " she told the press conference . german government officials had made it clear before the chancellor arrived in moscow that the iran issue would be the main discussion point between the two leaders , as it had become during merkel 's visit to washington last week . the chancellor had arrived for talks with president george w. bush on friday just hours after the foreign ministers of germany , britain and france had announced that talks with iran were at " a dead end . " merkel hoped putin would join in both merkel and bush agreed that while a diplomatic solution would continue to be sought , the next step in dealing with tehran would be to call on the iaea , the united nations nuclear watchdog , to approve a referral to the un security council after holding an emergency session . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's tour has turned into a search for diplomatic support fluent russian speaker merkel left for moscow hoping that she could persuade putin to stand side by side with the eu and us and offer a common approach to iran 's refusal to abandon uranium enrichment technology that could enable it to pursue a military nuclear program . the chancellor was encouraged by recent news that putin 's government had been annoyed by tehran 's rejection of moscow 's offer of a joint venture within russian borders that would allow iran to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under the watchful eye of the kremlin . enrichment offer still being considered however , putin announced that the deal was still on the table .
" we have heard various points of view from our iranian partners .
the iranian foreign ministry , notably , has said that it does not rule out accepting our proposal , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their business ties with iran will be affected if sanctions are brought both germany and russia stand to lose out economically if iran is brought before the un security council .
if a referral escalates the stand-off further , germany and russia - which have significant business interests and links with iran - could be severely out of pocket , particularly if sanctions are brought against the islamic state . but while putin 's stance shows that a nuclear-armed iran is not in russia 's interests , his caginess may hint at an underlying desire to protect business ties . russia likely to abstain in any security council vote some sources believe that russia will help the eu and us cause by not voting against security council action in the un but will also cover its own back by abstaining from the vote .
putin 's statement monday suggests a strong yes vote in line with the eu and us is highly unlikely . on the issue of russia 's human rights record and the continuing conflict in the war-ravaged breakaway republic of chechnya , merkel admitted that she could not find any " common ground " with the russian leader . " we have discussed subjects on which we do n't share the same opinion , notably on chechnya and the north caucasus ...
i will do everything to ensure that european programs contribute to the positive development of the region , " merkel said . divided on ngo law merkel expressed support for plans to build a gas pipeline direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany and other western european countries .
" the north european gas project is very important for europe and for germany .
it is a strategic project that is not aimed at anyone , " merkel said .
" the development of our relationship in the economic sphere takes one 's breath away , " she added . the chancellor also highlighted concerns about a disputed draft law on non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- . concerning the proposed ngo law , " there has been a lot of criticism ; a part of those criticisms have been taken into account , " merkel said .
" it will be necessary to monitor the way in which this law is applied in practice , " she said . putin defended the law on ngos - seen by activists as an attempt to rein in western funding of human rights and democracy groups - saying it was aimed at bringing greater transparency to ngo financing .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .

local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .

in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .
the new christian democrat family minister , ursula von der leyen , set the bar high in an interview with mass-circulation bild tabloid , when she called for the federal and state governments to make kindergartens available for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , ursula von der leyen ministry officials described von der leyen 's comments as a reaction to complaints from local authorities about plans make childcare costs tax-deductible .

" i call upon them to be brave and set new priorities .

local authorities currently invest 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- annually into childcare , with 20 percent of the overall cost covered by the fees from parents .

beck added that the issue of family and children was gaining importance . on monday , the spd , which fears it is disappearing beneath the shadow of merkel 's growing strength , emerged from a two-day strategy review , touting a new-found commitment to family affairs .
in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

27 , 1756 , he 's getting his own celebratory year . throughout the next 12 months , events will be held feting the austrian genius , who at three years of age was picking out chords on the harpsichord , at four playing short pieces and began composing at the tender age of five .
his parents , leopold and anna maria pertl mozartis , gave him the name johann chrysostom wolfgang theophilus .
his aptitude for music might have come partly from his father , a violinist and composer in his own right who was well known in europe . however , it soon became clear that the young mozart had a talent that outstripped his father 's and he embarked on a composing career that took him to courts and capitals around europe .
he spent a good deal of time in germany .
mozart 's life , however , was fraught with financial difficulty and illness .
often , he received no payment for his work , and the small amounts he did receive were quickly consumed by an extravagant lifestyle .
he died in vienna in 1791 ; he was only 35 years old .
mozart 's tremendous creative output includes works that are pinnacles of symphonic , chamber , piano , operatic and choral music .
many of these are now part of the standard concert repertory and widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style .

but as a new musical in the city of dresden shows , they have never been accepted . the aptly-named production " hartz iv - the musical , " which premiered to an eager audience on friday evening , is set in an employment office somewhere , but nowhere in particular , in germany .
against a backdrop of gray walls , time , and even life itself appears to stand still .
a notice board is starkly devoid of any information and seven people wait their turn to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " author and director erik gedeon , who confesses his own fear of being unemployed , says the aim of the musical is to show what being out of work can mean to the individuals concerned , and to underscore the reality that any one of us can fall victim to joblessness . gedeon 's characters appear lost in their own worlds , none of them remotely interested in the fate of the others around them .
when they do communicate with one another , it is through song , to melodies from musical hits such as " west side story , " " cats , " " hair " or " jesus christ superstar . " no knock-on political effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " hartz iv - the musical " the director and former artistic director of hamburg 's thalia theater , says he made a conscious decision not to compose any new music for his topical production , in order to be true to the subject matter .
" the distinguishing feature of hartz iv is that it forces people to live from what 's left , " gedeon told reporters . he rejects any notion that his musical makes fun of those affected by the labor reforms .
" music does n't only belong in the temple of beautiful art , but also has a place in the abyss , " he said , before adding that he is under no illusion that the piece will have any political affect whatsoever . the production is open to hartz iv recipients at a symbolic cost of one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities . for some years now , germany has been gaining a reputation as a place where the idea of family is as much an anomaly than a normality .
during chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership , the ministry for family affairs made an attempt to bang the drum for increased child-friendliness .
but for most observers , it never really seemed to amount to much more than a distant , discordant drone . now , with the new coalition comfortably installed in berlin , both the social democrats and angela merkel 's conservatives appear to have decided that the promotion and support of family life and children in general is a key to success .

in a draft resolution , the social democrats set out the objectives of guaranteeing children a kindergarten place from the age of two , creating a total of 230,000 new places for children under the age of three and granting free kindergarten places for the year before school begins . parties gear up for state elections many observers view this new-found dedication to parents and potential parents as an spd effort to sharpen its image while simultaneously distinguishing itself from the cdu ahead of three state elections in march .

in recent weeks , major employers , including the co-op , arcadia , provident financial and rentokil have cut back on their pension provision .
employees in these firms face a grim start to 2006 , either paying much more into the workplace pension or seeing their final salary pension scheme mothballed by their employer .
this has brought the pensions crisis home for thousands of uk workers .
" the concern is that we could be seeing a domino effect going on with pensions ... with one employer cutting benefits after another " malcolm mclean , chief executive of the pensions advisory service , told bbc news .
yet the latest figures from the national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- suggest that the rate of closure of final salary pension scheme has slowed during the past eighteen months . "
the biggest question is , does the government believe it can afford to pay a bigger better state pension ? "
malcolm mclean , pensions advisory service but this can be explained by the fact that so many final salary schemes were either closed to new members or closed altogether between 2000 and 2004 , so much so that there are so few active schemes left .

the biggest question is , does the government believe it can afford to pay a bigger better state pension ?
malcolm mclean , pensions advisory service but this can be explained by the fact that so many final salary schemes were either closed to new members or closed altogether between 2000 and 2004 , so much so that there are so few active schemes left .
potentially , as far as final salary pension provision in the private sector is concerned , vanishing point could be reached in 2006 " it seems to me the only thing keeping some firms from winding their pension schemes up is the costs associated with making good the scheme deficits , " mr mclean said .
reform agenda last november when the pensions commission published radical proposals for reform of the way that britain funds retirement , there seemed a route map out of the crisis .
in a 400 plus page report the commission called for : increase the state pension age for men and women to 66 by 2030 , to 67 by 2040 , and to 68 by 2050 , however if life expectancy races ahead the pension age may have to rise to 69 by 2050 make the state pension more generous and link future increases in it to earnings rather than prices in future , entitlement to the state pension should be based on residency rather than national insurance contributions automatically enrol people into a new low-cost government-administered savings scheme give people the chance to opt out if it 's not suitable for them .
even before publication of the report , the government promised to issue a white paper in the spring .
guide to uk pensions facts and figures outlining the depth of the uk pensions crisis at-a-glance " the issues are huge but the biggest question is , does the government believe it can afford to pay a bigger better state pension ? "
malcolm mclean said .
" everything flows from this , cutting back on means testing to encouraging a higher level of private saving , " he added .
however , in the run up to the publication of the pensions commission report , treasury officials busied themselves pouring cold water on the central idea of an enhanced state pension .
they suggested that the commission 's proposals were too costly and unworkable - the equivalent of being blackballed .
yet , subsequently , the mood music emanating from number 10 has suggested that the pensions commission report has greater legs than was presumed at the time of publication .
how much of the pensions commission 's report filters through to the white paper has the potential to become a tug of war between the incumbents of number 10 and number 11 downing street .
a lot now rests on the shoulders of work and pensions secretary john hutton , who took over from david blunkett in november .
under fire john hutton , work and pensions secretary , has a lot to think about it is not just the pensions commission 's proposal to reform the state pension that has drawn fire .
many insurers are against the idea of enrolling people into a national savings scheme .
cynics have suggested insurers are worried about the prospect that the savings scheme is designed to be far cheaper than personal pensions that they make millions of pounds from selling .
it is widely recognised that the savings scheme , if it gets the go-ahead , has the potential to kill personal pension sales stone dead .
but not all objections are rooted in self interest .
the napf is concerned that the savings scheme could have a detrimental effect on workplace pension provision .
at present on average companies which offer their workers a final salary pension contribute 17 % of salary .
but the new national savings scheme envisages an employer contribution of just 3 % .
the napf said this prompts the question : why should employers contribute 17 % of salary when some of their competitors are paying just 3 % ?
christine farnish the chief executive of the napf accused the commission of being " too complacent over the potential levelling down impact on workplace schemes . "
simplification but 2006 is not set to be all doom and gloom for pensions .
lots of people are put off pensions by the requirement to buy an annuity , end this requirement and you make pension saving more appealing sarah windsor-lewis , punter southall financial management in april reforms designed to simplify pension saving come into force .
for starters , the complex , age based , formula limiting pension contributions to a certain percentage of income is being swept away .
instead , whatever the age of the contributor , it will be possible to invest 100 % of annual income , up to a maximum £ 215,000 , in a pension and receive tax relief .
" this could be a big help in encouraging people in their forties and fifties who do n't have a pension at present , " sarah windsor-lewis , principal at punter southall financial management , said .
" under the present rules , it is often not worthwhile someone in their forties or fifties starting a pension .
" they simply are unable to save enough - within the strict age and income limits - to secure a big retirement income .
" but this will all change from april when it will be possible for someone to build a substantial pension up in little time ... provided they have enough money to pay in , " ms windsor-lewis added .
in addition , from april savers will no longer be forced to use their pension pot to buy an annuity income by age 75 .
instead pension holders will have the option to draw an income direct from their retirement savings pot rather than converting it into an annuity .
annuities are a much criticised product .
they are seen by some as being inflexible and offering a poor deal .
" this is good move ... lots of people are put off pensions by the requirement to buy an annuity , end this requirement and you make pension saving more appealing , " ms windsor-lewis added .

huw lewis , am for merthyr tydfil and rhymney , said his constituency had received a fraction of grant awards being made to cardiff and rural areas .
he claimed figures from culture minister alun pugh showed only £ 2,500 had been spent in merthyr since 2003 .
the acw disputed the figures and said more had to be done to increase people 's appetite for the arts .
there are no theatres in mr lewis ' constituency and he wants the theatre royal in merthyr , being used as a part-time bingo hall , renovated and turned into an arts centre .
he said figures from mr pugh showed that the acw had awarded £ 24m on projects in cardiff since 2003 , but claimed less than £ 2,500 went to groups in merthyr .
he told the bbc politics show : " if you look at those solid working class communities , particularly the south wales valleys , there is a dearth of investment .
" but yet if you look at cardiff and rural counties of wales , there has been investment in the millions .
there are plans for a theatre in an old chapel in merthyr " if we have an organisation spending £ 50m over a three-year period and my community is scraping together £ 2,500 , i do n't care if that is class war or not , that 's a bad investment for my community . "
his criticism follows the row over mr pugh 's announcement that he would advertise for the next chairman of the acw .
he said he wanted to attract someone who could raise arts attendances among lower income groups .
current chairman geraint talfan davies has already said he will not go through the " charade " of reapplying at the end of his three-year term .
' creating a problem ' he disputes the spending figures used by mr lewis .
although he accepted there had been an under-investment in merthyr in the past , he said that £ 50,000 had been spent in the past year .
" if you want to solve the question of barriers to arts attendance and participation , you have to look at employment , look at education , so you 're not just dealing with the opportunities for people to sample the arts but their appetite to do so , " said mr talfan davies .
in merthyr itself , there was support for the acw .
lisbeth mclean , a development officer with a project to turn an old chapel into a theatre , said : " i think the arts council are quite supportive of projects in merthyr tydfil .
" they attend arts forum meetings with us and encourage us to put applications forward .
i hope i 'll be working with them a lot over the next year on the development of the theatre " .
the assembly government is taking over more direct control of the acw and mr pugh called opponents ' claims it is becoming more politicised " nonsense " .
mr lewis told ams that mr pugh should ignore the " bleatings of the middle class cardiff and rural wales-based arts crachach -lrb- elite -rrb- " .
former culture minister , liberal democrat am jenny randerson said : " i think the culture minister is busily reinventing the class system .
" he 's creating a problem which organisations in the arts have gone nine-tenths of the way to solving " .

its reserves have ballooned in recent years as the central bank has bought most of the dollars generated by foreign trade and inward investment .
although its strategy has helped to dampen inflation and hold back the value of the yuan , it has annoyed china 's trading partners .
they feel the yuan is undervalued and creates an unfair trading environment .
japan has the world 's biggest foreign currency reserves , with $ 846.9bn , but at the current rate of growth , china 's reserves could overtake it , hitting $ 1 trillion this year .
china revealed last week that its trade surplus with the rest of world had more than tripled to $ 102bn in 2005 , up from $ 32bn in 2004 .
liberalising the yuan last year , beijing revalued the yuan for the first time in a decade , allowing it to appreciate against the dollar within a narrow trading band .
earlier this month it rose to its highest level , at 8.06 to the dollar , after china started setting its core daily value according to an average of quotes from 13 banks , including citibank , hsbc and abn amro .
but beijing will still only allow the currency to rise or fall by 0.3 % a day against the dollar .
it has repeatedly said that it wants to liberalise the yuan at a slow pace , so as not to risk destabilising the chinese economy .
rob subbaraman , from investment bank lehman brothers in tokyo , said the latest foreign reserves data would give more ammunition to us critics calling for a stronger yuan .
" you have an economy that has just turned out to be bigger than everyone thought , " mr subbaraman said .
" it 's growing around 10 % , and you have reserves growing to new record highs every month .
" that 's providing a lot of arguments for china to move a bit quicker on the currency front . "
revised government figures released last week showed that china 's economy grew by an average of 9.9 % between 1993 and 2004 .

" you drink the best and you drive the rest , " quips graham hilton who works for wessex grain 's bioethanol subsidiary green spirit fuels .
racing drivers have been using it for years , and many of them swear by it .
" it 's best for the environment and it does n't lack power , " says british touring car racer fiona leggate , who races a biofuel-powered vauxhall .
" i 'd love to see it as a mainstream fuel . "
the future of motoring it is a vision shared by somerset county councillor paul buchanan , who is involved in an ambitious biofuel experiment where local police will drive a fleet of 40 ford focus cars powered by as much as 85 % bioethanol made from locally grown grains .
when the bbc took a biofuel focus around the somerset countryside it felt no different from driving an ordinary model , though finding the fuel is pretty tricky .
but this might gradually change .
from march this year half a dozen supermarket forecourts - in taunton , bridgwater , bristol and shepton mallett - are preparing to supply the e85 biofuel under the somerset biofuel project , an initiative which is seeking the " sustainable distribution of a locally grown , environmentally friendly fuel " , according to mr hilton .
while this type of project is just the start , mr buchanan expects they will be " driving the sustainability agenda " .
environmentally friendly bioethanol made from grain produces 65 % fewer greenhouse gases than petrol , according to the uk government agency central science laboratory . "
there is the capacity to mobilise capital to build infrastructure to produce and distribute biofuels , and once you get the scale , the cost will come down " graham meeks climate change capital this is largely because the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during the production and consumption of ethanol is " almost equal to that removed from the atmosphere when crops for conversion are being grown " , according to saab great britain .
" one hectare of wheat produces about 29,000 miles of motoring , enough to take a car around the equator and still have 4,000 miles of fuel left , " adds green spirit fuels " the oil companies and the big car companies will be driven down this road by the consumer , " says mr buchanan .
converted cars to a limited extent , it is happening already .
some supermarket forecourts already mix ordinary petrol or diesel with biofuels , so that 5 % of what drivers put in their tanks is bioethanol made from plants or trees .
and the practice is set to pick up pace after the government announced its renewable transport fuel obligation last autumn , which states that 5 % of all motorcar fuel must come from renewable sources by 2010 . "
the way it has been positioned as a solution to uk motoring is naive " biofuel industry official biofuel raises global dilemmas but in order to move beyond this 5 % target , cars must go through a relatively cheap conversion that essentially involves replacing rubber seals and aluminium parts with materials that are not eroded by the bioethanol , explains andy taylor , ford europe 's director of corporate citizenship .
both ford and saab have unveiled bioethanol-enabled models for the uk market , which can run on pure petrol , or any mixture of petrol and bioethanol up to 85 % , if e85 is not available .
saab says its e85-enabled 9-5 biopower , which costs just £ 600 more than a standard 9-5 , has the potential of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 70 % while at the same time improving the car 's power .
e85 's higher octane rating adds 30bhp to the 150bhp turbocharged engine , and a 15 % gain in fuel efficiency can be had at high speeds , said kjell ac bergstrom , chief executive , of saab automobile powertrain .
" turbocharged engines are particularly well suited to the benefits of ethanol , " mr bergstrom says .
potential profits such confident swagger is turning heads in the world of finance , according to graham meeks of climate change capital , a specialist merchant bank .
" we 're seeing an enormous amount of interest from investors in this sector , " he says .
" the outlook is fairly positive , " mr meeks insists - even though " there is some way to go in improving yields from crops " , and despite bioethanol remaining a more expensive option than petrol due to " the cost of technology and the cost of feed stock " .
in the near future , the biofuel industry can expect ever more support , both the government and from brussels , as politicians look to both diversify fuel supply in order to improve fuel security , and to meet agreed reduction targets for carbon dioxide emissions , he predicts .
