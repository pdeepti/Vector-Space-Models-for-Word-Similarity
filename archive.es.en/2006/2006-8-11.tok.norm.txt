he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

and it just so happens that the company employs the son-in-law of merkel 's political partner , edmund stoiber . the german government held a competition involving 18 production companies to determine which would be selected for the high-profile job of producing merkel 's weekly video messages explaining government policies to the nation . the winning company is the munich-based firm evisco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 opinion : shattering the illusion of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this commentary , deutsche welle 's chief correspondent peter philipp discusses the foiled terrorist plot in london and the effects of the so-called " war on terror . " " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .
a crudely false estimation whose fatal consequences israel is also now experiencing in lebanon . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and middle east expert . translated from the original text -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .

on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .

the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .

politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .

cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 opinion : shattering the illusion of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this commentary , deutsche welle 's chief correspondent peter philipp discusses the foiled terrorist plot in london and the effects of the so-called " war on terror . " " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .
a crudely false estimation whose fatal consequences israel is also now experiencing in lebanon . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and middle east expert . translated from the original text -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .
a crudely false estimation whose fatal consequences israel is also now experiencing in lebanon . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and middle east expert . translated from the original text -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin brandauer 's betrayal of brecht culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.08.2006 " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht radically changed theater , both technically and politically bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world 50 years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

dortmund have the first chance to bring down the bavarians in the bundesliga 's opening match . as usual bayern start as favorites to collect a third successive crown and 21st title overall , but the summer departure of german international captain michael ballack to english champions chelsea has given their rivals renewed hope . without ballack bayern collapsed to a 2-0 defeat in saturday 's league cup final against werder bremen and then lost an exhibition match 3-0 to second division 1860 munich on wednesday . " nothing happened on offense or defense , " said bayern and france defender willy sagnol .

" we are shooting too few goals - we have to change that by friday . " bayern will be looking for new acquisition lukas podolski , who cost munich 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- to take on goal scoring duties while other newcomer daniel van buyten will shore up the defense in their bayern debuts on friday . even as dortmund 's new signings of swiss striker alexander frei and paraguayan star nelson valdez reach top fitness and captain christian wörns still serving a bench sentence from last season , coach bert van marwijk said he is not concerned about the state of his team " we can go to munich without being afraid , " he said .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .
while there has been some transfer action at the allianz arena , with germany striker lukas podolski adding a new edge to the attack and daniel van buyten bringing some steel to the back four , bayern will be more or less the same team that won the league and cup double for the second year running last time out . with one noticeable exception , of course : michael ballack will be playing his soccer on the lush turfs of the english premiership for champions chelsea while his old team mates toil over the pitches of his homeland .
how bayern cope without the talismanic germany captain may be the story of their season .
but with such a depth in the squad and midfielders such as owen hargreaves ready to stand up and be counted in the commander 's role , felix magath 's team are unlikely to struggle . hamburg , werder chasi n g agai n as with every season , bayern start as favorites .
but who will be their main contenders ?
last season , hamburg sv bounced back from an almost disastrous flirtation with relegation a year before to fight the champions for the title .
despite losing van buyten to their main rivals , hsv will be boosted by the return to action of rafael van der vaart and the arrival of bayern 's unwanted striker paulo guerrero .
if thomas doll can avoid the kind of mid-season wobble that put paid to hsv 's title aspirations and saw them finish third , bayern can expect some sleepless nights dreaming about the results rolling in at the aol arena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have already drawn first blood against bayern there or thereabouts will be werder bremen again .
it would take a fool to write off thomas schaaf 's perennial title contenders who ended up as runners-up last year and who have already won the league cup , beating bayern 2-0 last saturday . with experienced world cup players such as miroslav klose , torsten frings and tim borowski and new brazilian midfield maestro diego from fc porto , werder again look a force to be reckoned with .
if golden boot winner klose and strike partner ivan klasnic can connect as well as they did last season , and if frings and diego can provide the ammunition , bundesliga fans can expect another bumper goal tally from bremen … and maybe a championship title ? followi n g pack looki n g to improve a number of the following pack from last season could get it together to challenge this season .
schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .
the unpredictable striker 's responsibilities will be taken over by former red star belgrade forward marko pantelic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david odonkor , with oliver neuville , was a surprise hit borussia dortmund will also be hoping to improve on the last few seasons of underachievement but will have to do so without the czech republic pair tomas rosicky and jan koller who have moved on to pastures new . bvb 's close season signings nelson valdez and alex frei will be hoping to fill the considerable shoes of the departed dortmund icons .
world cup surprise package david odonkor will also be looking to transfer his international pace and impact to the domestic stage to help bvb scale almost-forgotten heights . also-ra n s will plod o n as n ew boys look to stay up meanwhile , as the perennial also-rans look forward to battling their way out of obscurity with the possible lure of a uefa cup spot their only reward for a season of toil , the new boys will be hoping to avoid a swift return to the second division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfl star benny auer vfl bochum will not be suffering any nosebleeds in the heady heights of the first division .
the elevators , known as such due to their propensity for relegation and promotion in alternating seasons , will know what is needed to stay up - but the question will remain whether marcel koller 's team has the quality to survive . energie cottbus are back in the big time and are the only east german side in the league this year .
they intend to be there next season too despite predictions already putting them in pole position to be the first team down while alemannia aachen 's trainer dieter hecking will be hoping that his side slips under the relegation radar and claims a few scalps in the bundesliga as they bid to stay up against the odds . nothing is settled and anything can happen .
each club enters the new season on an even keel .
the teams will all start their campaigns with great hope and expectation , something which will roll down from the terraces from the very first whistle to the last .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .
-lrb- july 6 , 2004 -rrb- hallelujah !
it 's raining knickers in hamburg what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity .
-lrb- march 20 , 2006 -rrb- flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

" the expellee exhibition which opened thursday in berlin does n't contribute to polish-german reconciliation , however it ca n't be accused of altering the facts , " wrote rzeczpospolita daily friday .
" everything is historically true , " continued the paper , and the exhibition " underlines that , despite the agreements made at the potsdam conference , displaced germans on territory under polish administration were not treated in a humanitarian way . "
the paper concluded by quoting from the thursday edition of die zeit , a german weekly , which had also written that the exhibition did not contribute to the improvement of polish-german relations . " the official opening of the exhibition ' paths unchosen , ' which distorts and misrepresents the history of the second world war , took place yesterday at 6:00 p.m. in the kronprinzpalais in berlin , " wrote warsaw daily nasz dziennik .
the paper regretted that the exhibition seemed to ignore " the polish-german agreement from 1990 where germany relinquished its claim to former territories . "
the exhibition presented information on displaced persons from various times and places , " however , completely disproportionately . "
" unfortunately , steinbach 's interpretations managed to convince many foreign journalists , " wrote the paper , referring to the director of the league of german expellees , erika steinbach .
" many of them think that it will be difficult to criticize her and now it will be easier for her to open the center against expulsions .
we will certainly be able to read such commentaries in today 's foreign newspapers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach and her new exhibit did not go over well in poland zycie warszawy contradicted markus meckel from the german social democratic party , who had said the exhibit could overcome the controversy against the league of german expellees by approaching the topic from a european perspective .
" this is not authentic , " wrote the paper .
" the league of german expellees has officially distanced itself from the claims made by the preussiche treuhand -lrb- a private group focussed on making claims for formerly german-owned property on the part of expellees -rrb- , but bestows its people with important functions along these lines . "
the paper agreed with exhibit curator wilfried rogach , who said , " everyone knows that the greatest tragedy on the seas was the sinking of the titanic .
but nobody knows that many more people perished on the wilhelm gustloff . "
the nazi ship , carrying thousands of german refugees , was sunk by the red army off the coast of danzig in 1945 and over 9,000 people were killed .
" but what ca n't be found at the exhibit ? " asked the warsaw daily .
" a national tragedy resulting in 6 million dead poles , 817 pacified villages , destroyed cities , the mutilation of poland and its subordination by the ussr until 1989 remains outside of the public consciousness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2006 foiled british attack triggers security debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british bomb scare has raised security questions the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us has reignited a security debate in germany with politicians split on tightening counter-terrorism laws . a day after news emerged that british police had stopped a potentially massive terrorist strike , germany was debating the security lessons to be drawn from the bomb scare .
politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .
the idea is that all security , intelligence and counter-crime agencies both at the state and federal level would have access to the register . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say germany 's security agencies are too bogged down in red tape on friday , beckstein said that the events in britain showed that germany needed a closer networking of its myriad security agencies if quick decisions needed to be taken in an emergency .
cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion . " the citizens should n't be made uneasy without a well-founded reason , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said , adding that she did n't think germany was facing an increased terrorist threat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says a concerted effort to fight terrorism is needed european union security and justice commissioner franco frattini said that british police 's foiling of a plot to bomb transatlantic flights highlighted the need for " concerted " efforts to fight terrorism .

on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .

we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin brandauer 's betrayal of brecht culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.08.2006 " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht radically changed theater , both technically and politically bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world 50 years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .

" his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .

he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed .

" brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

" the expellee exhibition which opened thursday in berlin does n't contribute to polish-german reconciliation , however it ca n't be accused of altering the facts , " wrote rzeczpospolita daily friday .
" everything is historically true , " continued the paper , and the exhibition " underlines that , despite the agreements made at the potsdam conference , displaced germans on territory under polish administration were not treated in a humanitarian way . "
the paper concluded by quoting from the thursday edition of die zeit , a german weekly , which had also written that the exhibition did not contribute to the improvement of polish-german relations . " the official opening of the exhibition ' paths unchosen , ' which distorts and misrepresents the history of the second world war , took place yesterday at 6:00 p.m. in the kronprinzpalais in berlin , " wrote warsaw daily nasz dziennik .
the paper regretted that the exhibition seemed to ignore " the polish-german agreement from 1990 where germany relinquished its claim to former territories . "
the exhibition presented information on displaced persons from various times and places , " however , completely disproportionately . "
" unfortunately , steinbach 's interpretations managed to convince many foreign journalists , " wrote the paper , referring to the director of the league of german expellees , erika steinbach .
" many of them think that it will be difficult to criticize her and now it will be easier for her to open the center against expulsions .
we will certainly be able to read such commentaries in today 's foreign newspapers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach and her new exhibit did not go over well in poland zycie warszawy contradicted markus meckel from the german social democratic party , who had said the exhibit could overcome the controversy against the league of german expellees by approaching the topic from a european perspective .
" this is not authentic , " wrote the paper .
" the league of german expellees has officially distanced itself from the claims made by the preussiche treuhand -lrb- a private group focussed on making claims for formerly german-owned property on the part of expellees -rrb- , but bestows its people with important functions along these lines . "
the paper agreed with exhibit curator wilfried rogach , who said , " everyone knows that the greatest tragedy on the seas was the sinking of the titanic .
but nobody knows that many more people perished on the wilhelm gustloff . "
the nazi ship , carrying thousands of german refugees , was sunk by the red army off the coast of danzig in 1945 and over 9,000 people were killed .
" but what ca n't be found at the exhibit ? " asked the warsaw daily .
" a national tragedy resulting in 6 million dead poles , 817 pacified villages , destroyed cities , the mutilation of poland and its subordination by the ussr until 1989 remains outside of the public consciousness .

politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat .

" a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion .

" we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .
the idea is that all security , intelligence and counter-crime agencies both at the state and federal level would have access to the register . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say germany 's security agencies are too bogged down in red tape on friday , beckstein said that the events in britain showed that germany needed a closer networking of its myriad security agencies if quick decisions needed to be taken in an emergency .
cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion . " the citizens should n't be made uneasy without a well-founded reason , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said , adding that she did n't think germany was facing an increased terrorist threat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says a concerted effort to fight terrorism is needed european union security and justice commissioner franco frattini said that british police 's foiling of a plot to bomb transatlantic flights highlighted the need for " concerted " efforts to fight terrorism .

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .

" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .

" the financial times deutschland reported that the contract to produce the podcasts until the end of the year is worth 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- . the company that had been producing merkel 's weekly videos since the beginning of june reportedly wanted more money to continue the job . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new vodcasting star is born : german chancellor merkel german chancellor merkel , already known for her speedy cell-phone text-messaging skills , is now entering the world of digital media as the first head of state to address her nation via a video podcast .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .
while there has been some transfer action at the allianz arena , with germany striker lukas podolski adding a new edge to the attack and daniel van buyten bringing some steel to the back four , bayern will be more or less the same team that won the league and cup double for the second year running last time out . with one noticeable exception , of course : michael ballack will be playing his soccer on the lush turfs of the english premiership for champions chelsea while his old team mates toil over the pitches of his homeland .
how bayern cope without the talismanic germany captain may be the story of their season .
but with such a depth in the squad and midfielders such as owen hargreaves ready to stand up and be counted in the commander 's role , felix magath 's team are unlikely to struggle . hamburg , werder chasi n g agai n as with every season , bayern start as favorites .
but who will be their main contenders ?
last season , hamburg sv bounced back from an almost disastrous flirtation with relegation a year before to fight the champions for the title .
despite losing van buyten to their main rivals , hsv will be boosted by the return to action of rafael van der vaart and the arrival of bayern 's unwanted striker paulo guerrero .

schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .

schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .
the unpredictable striker 's responsibilities will be taken over by former red star belgrade forward marko pantelic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david odonkor , with oliver neuville , was a surprise hit borussia dortmund will also be hoping to improve on the last few seasons of underachievement but will have to do so without the czech republic pair tomas rosicky and jan koller who have moved on to pastures new . bvb 's close season signings nelson valdez and alex frei will be hoping to fill the considerable shoes of the departed dortmund icons .
world cup surprise package david odonkor will also be looking to transfer his international pace and impact to the domestic stage to help bvb scale almost-forgotten heights . also-ra n s will plod o n as n ew boys look to stay up meanwhile , as the perennial also-rans look forward to battling their way out of obscurity with the possible lure of a uefa cup spot their only reward for a season of toil , the new boys will be hoping to avoid a swift return to the second division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfl star benny auer vfl bochum will not be suffering any nosebleeds in the heady heights of the first division .
the elevators , known as such due to their propensity for relegation and promotion in alternating seasons , will know what is needed to stay up - but the question will remain whether marcel koller 's team has the quality to survive . energie cottbus are back in the big time and are the only east german side in the league this year .
they intend to be there next season too despite predictions already putting them in pole position to be the first team down while alemannia aachen 's trainer dieter hecking will be hoping that his side slips under the relegation radar and claims a few scalps in the bundesliga as they bid to stay up against the odds . nothing is settled and anything can happen .
each club enters the new season on an even keel .
the teams will all start their campaigns with great hope and expectation , something which will roll down from the terraces from the very first whistle to the last .

" the world cup was important for me but now it all starts again , " he said , adding that the new focus would be on the german league season .
" it would be great to top last season , but i am starting from scratch again at bremen and there is a lot of work to do for all of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one celebrated more world cup goals than klose officials at werder bremen , where klose plays every week , were more buoyant about the 28-year-old striker - who nearly became a carpenter rather than soccer player - was voted german player of the year on thursday . " miro has absolutely earned this honor , " team manager klaus allofs said .
" he had phenomenal achievements with werder bremen and the national team . " bremen coach thomas schaaf called klose the " best thing the bundesliga has to offer , " which gives schaaf extra reason to be pleased as he managed to sign the polish-born forward , who is germany 's third all-time world cup scorer with 10 goals , until 2008 . still no silverware in klose 's cabinet last season klose was the german top-flight 's top scorer , finding the back of the net 25 times , earning him the german player of the year award and he capped his best ever campaign by lifting the golden boot at the world cup after scoring five goals . at 28 , the he 's at his peak and wants to win a first major trophy with werder bremen after going so close with germany in the summer . " we want to be champions but it will be very , very difficult , " klose said .
" however , those responsible have been thinking a lot and bolstering the bremen squad intelligently . " bildunterschrift : klose gets in a foot against bayern in the league cup bremen dangerous in front of the net armed with klose 's lethal shot , bremen 's attack is undoubtedly their main attribute as croatian international ivan klasnic and egyptian marksman mohamed zidan both vie for the chance to partner next to klose up front . last season bremen plundered 79 goals in 34 league matches to finish second , and they showed they can compete with bayern in saturday 's league cup final when they defeated felix magath 's side 2-0 in leipzig to win the league 's first title . if klose , who recently became a father to twin daughters , can repeat his 25-goal haul from last season this time around , bremen might be able to take a more prestigious trophy or two by may 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early blow to bayern as bremen win league cup werder bremen picked up the first piece of silverware in the 2006/07 season defeating bayern munich 2-0 in leipzig on saturday to lift the league cup for the first time in their history .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

" -lrb- thursday 's -rrb- events show once more that terrorism is a continuous and global threat in europe and in other parts of the world , which calls for a constant , concerted response from all european countries , institutions and peoples , " frattini said . " the european union 's counter-terrorism policies in all its dimensions , including prevention , protection , prosecution and response , will be implemented with full vigor to this end , " he added . he was responding to a terrorist threat announced thursday which saw security increased at airports across the globe after british police said they had foiled a plot to blow up flights to the united states with explosives hidden in hand baggage . london 's heathrow airport , one of the busiest in the world , was effectively closed to incoming flights , seriously disrupting air travel in europe . eu transport commissioner jacques barrot welcomed efforts from european air traffic control coordinator eurocontrol , which prevented flights from taking off for heathrow and helped reroute european flights already on their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us carriers continental , american and united were apparent targets from london " the aviation industry showed great solidarity in very difficult circumstances , " he said . the plot unravels meanwhile , the british daily the guardian reported that the british suicide bombers were within days of blowing up 12 passenger jets above us cities . some observers have speculated that the bombings could have coincided with the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the us . the guardian wrote that anti-terrorist specialists had uncovered the plot by watching a group of young british muslims .
surveillance began nearly a year ago and plans for suicide bombings would have been on a dimension unfathomed until now . us and british officials claimed that the majority of the plotters were british muslims of pakistani descent who intended to carry liquid explosives in beverage bottles in their hand luggage on flights headed to the us from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight at all uk airports , including gatwick , causing long lines the guardian wrote that security officials believed that once the jets were in the air over american cities , the plotters intended to mix the explosives and detonate them using an electrical charge from an ipod .
apparently , the suicide-bombers-to-be had targeted new york , washington , san francisco , boston and los angeles . had the plot succeeded , it would have meant the possible loss of thousands of lives . pakistan-afghanistan border arrest british police were tipped off following an arrest on pakistan 's border to afghanistan two weeks ago , a pakistani government official said .
that sent the british police into action on thursday , after they intercepted a message from pakistan telling the bombers to " go now , " the guardian wrote . while police had intended to move in on the cells within the next few days , the intercepted message forced them to act early thursday . british police arrested 24 suspects on thursday , one of whom may have worked at heathrow airport .
there are claims , however , that up to 50 people might have been involved in the plot ; police officers are still on the hunt . the bank of england on firday froze the assets of 19 of the arrested suspects , and also released their names . speculations likewise exist that other plotters may now decide to act more quickly out of fear of exposure by the suspects arrested yesterday or that police may discover them . high alert security is still at high alert in at britsh , us and continental european airports . news agencies reported that indian officials have received information that militants may be planning to carry out bombings on us airline carriers leaving new delhi and mumbai in the coming days , perhaps on august 15 , india 's independence day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .

" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .

critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .
a crudely false estimation whose fatal consequences israel is also now experiencing in lebanon . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and middle east expert . translated from the original text -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion .

" the expellee exhibition which opened thursday in berlin does n't contribute to polish-german reconciliation , however it ca n't be accused of altering the facts , " wrote rzeczpospolita daily friday .
" everything is historically true , " continued the paper , and the exhibition " underlines that , despite the agreements made at the potsdam conference , displaced germans on territory under polish administration were not treated in a humanitarian way . "
the paper concluded by quoting from the thursday edition of die zeit , a german weekly , which had also written that the exhibition did not contribute to the improvement of polish-german relations . " the official opening of the exhibition ' paths unchosen , ' which distorts and misrepresents the history of the second world war , took place yesterday at 6:00 p.m. in the kronprinzpalais in berlin , " wrote warsaw daily nasz dziennik .
the paper regretted that the exhibition seemed to ignore " the polish-german agreement from 1990 where germany relinquished its claim to former territories . "
the exhibition presented information on displaced persons from various times and places , " however , completely disproportionately . "
" unfortunately , steinbach 's interpretations managed to convince many foreign journalists , " wrote the paper , referring to the director of the league of german expellees , erika steinbach .
" many of them think that it will be difficult to criticize her and now it will be easier for her to open the center against expulsions .
we will certainly be able to read such commentaries in today 's foreign newspapers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach and her new exhibit did not go over well in poland zycie warszawy contradicted markus meckel from the german social democratic party , who had said the exhibit could overcome the controversy against the league of german expellees by approaching the topic from a european perspective .
" this is not authentic , " wrote the paper .
" the league of german expellees has officially distanced itself from the claims made by the preussiche treuhand -lrb- a private group focussed on making claims for formerly german-owned property on the part of expellees -rrb- , but bestows its people with important functions along these lines . "
the paper agreed with exhibit curator wilfried rogach , who said , " everyone knows that the greatest tragedy on the seas was the sinking of the titanic .
but nobody knows that many more people perished on the wilhelm gustloff . "
the nazi ship , carrying thousands of german refugees , was sunk by the red army off the coast of danzig in 1945 and over 9,000 people were killed .
" but what ca n't be found at the exhibit ? " asked the warsaw daily .
" a national tragedy resulting in 6 million dead poles , 817 pacified villages , destroyed cities , the mutilation of poland and its subordination by the ussr until 1989 remains outside of the public consciousness .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?

after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?

rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .

" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .

the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2006 foiled british attack triggers security debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british bomb scare has raised security questions the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us has reignited a security debate in germany with politicians split on tightening counter-terrorism laws . a day after news emerged that british police had stopped a potentially massive terrorist strike , germany was debating the security lessons to be drawn from the bomb scare .
politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .
the idea is that all security , intelligence and counter-crime agencies both at the state and federal level would have access to the register . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say germany 's security agencies are too bogged down in red tape on friday , beckstein said that the events in britain showed that germany needed a closer networking of its myriad security agencies if quick decisions needed to be taken in an emergency .
cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion . " the citizens should n't be made uneasy without a well-founded reason , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said , adding that she did n't think germany was facing an increased terrorist threat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says a concerted effort to fight terrorism is needed european union security and justice commissioner franco frattini said that british police 's foiling of a plot to bomb transatlantic flights highlighted the need for " concerted " efforts to fight terrorism .

politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .
the idea is that all security , intelligence and counter-crime agencies both at the state and federal level would have access to the register . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say germany 's security agencies are too bogged down in red tape on friday , beckstein said that the events in britain showed that germany needed a closer networking of its myriad security agencies if quick decisions needed to be taken in an emergency .
cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion . " the citizens should n't be made uneasy without a well-founded reason , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said , adding that she did n't think germany was facing an increased terrorist threat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says a concerted effort to fight terrorism is needed european union security and justice commissioner franco frattini said that british police 's foiling of a plot to bomb transatlantic flights highlighted the need for " concerted " efforts to fight terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .

cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach and her new exhibit did not go over well in poland zycie warszawy contradicted markus meckel from the german social democratic party , who had said the exhibit could overcome the controversy against the league of german expellees by approaching the topic from a european perspective .
" this is not authentic , " wrote the paper .
" the league of german expellees has officially distanced itself from the claims made by the preussiche treuhand -lrb- a private group focussed on making claims for formerly german-owned property on the part of expellees -rrb- , but bestows its people with important functions along these lines . "
the paper agreed with exhibit curator wilfried rogach , who said , " everyone knows that the greatest tragedy on the seas was the sinking of the titanic .
but nobody knows that many more people perished on the wilhelm gustloff . "
the nazi ship , carrying thousands of german refugees , was sunk by the red army off the coast of danzig in 1945 and over 9,000 people were killed .
" but what ca n't be found at the exhibit ? " asked the warsaw daily .
" a national tragedy resulting in 6 million dead poles , 817 pacified villages , destroyed cities , the mutilation of poland and its subordination by the ussr until 1989 remains outside of the public consciousness .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

dortmund have the first chance to bring down the bavarians in the bundesliga 's opening match . as usual bayern start as favorites to collect a third successive crown and 21st title overall , but the summer departure of german international captain michael ballack to english champions chelsea has given their rivals renewed hope . without ballack bayern collapsed to a 2-0 defeat in saturday 's league cup final against werder bremen and then lost an exhibition match 3-0 to second division 1860 munich on wednesday .

" the expellee exhibition which opened thursday in berlin does n't contribute to polish-german reconciliation , however it ca n't be accused of altering the facts , " wrote rzeczpospolita daily friday .
" everything is historically true , " continued the paper , and the exhibition " underlines that , despite the agreements made at the potsdam conference , displaced germans on territory under polish administration were not treated in a humanitarian way . "
the paper concluded by quoting from the thursday edition of die zeit , a german weekly , which had also written that the exhibition did not contribute to the improvement of polish-german relations . " the official opening of the exhibition ' paths unchosen , ' which distorts and misrepresents the history of the second world war , took place yesterday at 6:00 p.m. in the kronprinzpalais in berlin , " wrote warsaw daily nasz dziennik .
the paper regretted that the exhibition seemed to ignore " the polish-german agreement from 1990 where germany relinquished its claim to former territories . "
the exhibition presented information on displaced persons from various times and places , " however , completely disproportionately . "
" unfortunately , steinbach 's interpretations managed to convince many foreign journalists , " wrote the paper , referring to the director of the league of german expellees , erika steinbach .
" many of them think that it will be difficult to criticize her and now it will be easier for her to open the center against expulsions .
we will certainly be able to read such commentaries in today 's foreign newspapers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach and her new exhibit did not go over well in poland zycie warszawy contradicted markus meckel from the german social democratic party , who had said the exhibit could overcome the controversy against the league of german expellees by approaching the topic from a european perspective .
" this is not authentic , " wrote the paper .
" the league of german expellees has officially distanced itself from the claims made by the preussiche treuhand -lrb- a private group focussed on making claims for formerly german-owned property on the part of expellees -rrb- , but bestows its people with important functions along these lines . "
the paper agreed with exhibit curator wilfried rogach , who said , " everyone knows that the greatest tragedy on the seas was the sinking of the titanic .
but nobody knows that many more people perished on the wilhelm gustloff . "
the nazi ship , carrying thousands of german refugees , was sunk by the red army off the coast of danzig in 1945 and over 9,000 people were killed .
" but what ca n't be found at the exhibit ? " asked the warsaw daily .
" a national tragedy resulting in 6 million dead poles , 817 pacified villages , destroyed cities , the mutilation of poland and its subordination by the ussr until 1989 remains outside of the public consciousness .

" the expellee exhibition which opened thursday in berlin does n't contribute to polish-german reconciliation , however it ca n't be accused of altering the facts , " wrote rzeczpospolita daily friday .
" everything is historically true , " continued the paper , and the exhibition " underlines that , despite the agreements made at the potsdam conference , displaced germans on territory under polish administration were not treated in a humanitarian way . "
the paper concluded by quoting from the thursday edition of die zeit , a german weekly , which had also written that the exhibition did not contribute to the improvement of polish-german relations . " the official opening of the exhibition ' paths unchosen , ' which distorts and misrepresents the history of the second world war , took place yesterday at 6:00 p.m. in the kronprinzpalais in berlin , " wrote warsaw daily nasz dziennik .

dortmund have the first chance to bring down the bavarians in the bundesliga 's opening match . as usual bayern start as favorites to collect a third successive crown and 21st title overall , but the summer departure of german international captain michael ballack to english champions chelsea has given their rivals renewed hope . without ballack bayern collapsed to a 2-0 defeat in saturday 's league cup final against werder bremen and then lost an exhibition match 3-0 to second division 1860 munich on wednesday . " nothing happened on offense or defense , " said bayern and france defender willy sagnol .
" it was a catastrophe . " manager felix magath said his players are still drained after this summer 's world cup where 10 bayern players - significantly more than any of their bundesliga rivals - were actively involved . can poldi provide the goals bayern need ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , right , gave everything he had in preseason training " we always said we would have problems at the start of the season as a result of the world cup , " magath said , adding that the team knows what it needs to do to improve .
" we are shooting too few goals - we have to change that by friday . " bayern will be looking for new acquisition lukas podolski , who cost munich 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- to take on goal scoring duties while other newcomer daniel van buyten will shore up the defense in their bayern debuts on friday . even as dortmund 's new signings of swiss striker alexander frei and paraguayan star nelson valdez reach top fitness and captain christian wörns still serving a bench sentence from last season , coach bert van marwijk said he is not concerned about the state of his team " we can go to munich without being afraid , " he said .
" we absolutely have a chance and want to get some points . " neither side left with much time to prepare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oliver kahn is glad to be putting his gloves on again after nursing a knee injury , roman weidenfeller is back between the posts for dortmund and will be faced with the task of blocking the bayern offense of podolski and roy makaay , who have been running into each other in pre-season training , with an defense that has n't had much time to play together . " unfortunately , we have n't had a lot of time to gel together , but the same can be said for bayern , " weidenfeller said . easier start for other perennial contenders schalke 04 host eintracht frankfurt on saturday and last season 's runners-up bremen can scrutinize bayern ahead of their opening game against hanover on sunday . with german international striker miroslav klose - golden boot winner at the world cup and recently voted german player of the year - leading the attack bremen appear best-equipped to challenge bayern and in thomas schaaf they have a manager who knows how to topple the giants having done it in 2004 . " werder have the biggest potential in the bundesliga , " said german international torsten frings . " there is no better team in the league and i do not think the gap to bayern was ever as big as some say . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv crews are also getting back to into practice hamburg open their campaign against bielefeld on saturday aiming to build on last season when they surprised all by finishing third . selling defensive pillar van buyten to bayern will not help , but his 20-year-old replacement vincent kompany , an 8 million euro capture from anderlecht , remains confident .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

and it just so happens that the company employs the son-in-law of merkel 's political partner , edmund stoiber . the german government held a competition involving 18 production companies to determine which would be selected for the high-profile job of producing merkel 's weekly video messages explaining government policies to the nation . the winning company is the munich-based firm evisco .
according to a government spokesperson , it came out ahead of the competition because it offered the best value for money . but eyebrows were raised when the decision was announced , because one of evisco 's directors is jürgen hausmann , the son-in-law of merkel 's political cohort , edmund stoiber . stoiber , the premier of bavaria , also heads the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are close political allies " relationships did not play a role in the awarding of the contract , " hausmann told the augsburger allgemeinen newspaper .
" we won the contract based on our performance and fair price . " the financial times deutschland reported that the contract to produce the podcasts until the end of the year is worth 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- . the company that had been producing merkel 's weekly videos since the beginning of june reportedly wanted more money to continue the job . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new vodcasting star is born : german chancellor merkel german chancellor merkel , already known for her speedy cell-phone text-messaging skills , is now entering the world of digital media as the first head of state to address her nation via a video podcast .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .

for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

the news published by the bild zeitung this week that a full 18 percent of german men do n't feel compelled to change their underwear on a daily basis may be rather shocking , but count your blessings , ladies . only two years ago , dw-world.de reported on a survey about hygiene habits that revealed that over 30 percent of men were letting their shorts do double duty . can we trust that a national awakening to the importance of clean undies has really led to this massive improvement ?
in which case , we say : keep it up , fellas .
after all , 18 percent of you are still walking around in dirty dessous . or is there some other explanation behind these wildly varying survey results ?
granted , the surveys were carried out by two different organizations .
perhaps the most recent survey by germany 's pharmacy trade publication apotheken umschau happened upon a more fastidious cross-section of german males . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what we like to see or , more disturbingly , perhaps respondents in the 2004 survey conducted by market research institute marplan were simply more honest - which would suggest that german men are just as slovenly as they always were . in any case , bild is campaigning for change - or at least more frequent underwear changes .
rather than simply print the latest survey results and leave readers to wrinkle their noses in disgust , the paper decided that scare tactics are the way to go . it quoted a reputable urologist who warned that multiple wearings of dirty underpants can lead to chronic infections , abscesses or parasites - and in the worst case scenario , even cancer of the penis . if that does n't bring the percentage of repeat briefs-wearers down to 0.01 percent of german men by the time the next such survey surfaces in two years ' time , then we do n't know what will . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .
while there has been some transfer action at the allianz arena , with germany striker lukas podolski adding a new edge to the attack and daniel van buyten bringing some steel to the back four , bayern will be more or less the same team that won the league and cup double for the second year running last time out . with one noticeable exception , of course : michael ballack will be playing his soccer on the lush turfs of the english premiership for champions chelsea while his old team mates toil over the pitches of his homeland .
how bayern cope without the talismanic germany captain may be the story of their season .
but with such a depth in the squad and midfielders such as owen hargreaves ready to stand up and be counted in the commander 's role , felix magath 's team are unlikely to struggle . hamburg , werder chasi n g agai n as with every season , bayern start as favorites .
but who will be their main contenders ?
last season , hamburg sv bounced back from an almost disastrous flirtation with relegation a year before to fight the champions for the title .
despite losing van buyten to their main rivals , hsv will be boosted by the return to action of rafael van der vaart and the arrival of bayern 's unwanted striker paulo guerrero .
if thomas doll can avoid the kind of mid-season wobble that put paid to hsv 's title aspirations and saw them finish third , bayern can expect some sleepless nights dreaming about the results rolling in at the aol arena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have already drawn first blood against bayern there or thereabouts will be werder bremen again .
it would take a fool to write off thomas schaaf 's perennial title contenders who ended up as runners-up last year and who have already won the league cup , beating bayern 2-0 last saturday . with experienced world cup players such as miroslav klose , torsten frings and tim borowski and new brazilian midfield maestro diego from fc porto , werder again look a force to be reckoned with .
if golden boot winner klose and strike partner ivan klasnic can connect as well as they did last season , and if frings and diego can provide the ammunition , bundesliga fans can expect another bumper goal tally from bremen … and maybe a championship title ? followi n g pack looki n g to improve a number of the following pack from last season could get it together to challenge this season .
schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .
the unpredictable striker 's responsibilities will be taken over by former red star belgrade forward marko pantelic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david odonkor , with oliver neuville , was a surprise hit borussia dortmund will also be hoping to improve on the last few seasons of underachievement but will have to do so without the czech republic pair tomas rosicky and jan koller who have moved on to pastures new . bvb 's close season signings nelson valdez and alex frei will be hoping to fill the considerable shoes of the departed dortmund icons .
world cup surprise package david odonkor will also be looking to transfer his international pace and impact to the domestic stage to help bvb scale almost-forgotten heights . also-ra n s will plod o n as n ew boys look to stay up meanwhile , as the perennial also-rans look forward to battling their way out of obscurity with the possible lure of a uefa cup spot their only reward for a season of toil , the new boys will be hoping to avoid a swift return to the second division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfl star benny auer vfl bochum will not be suffering any nosebleeds in the heady heights of the first division .
the elevators , known as such due to their propensity for relegation and promotion in alternating seasons , will know what is needed to stay up - but the question will remain whether marcel koller 's team has the quality to survive . energie cottbus are back in the big time and are the only east german side in the league this year .
they intend to be there next season too despite predictions already putting them in pole position to be the first team down while alemannia aachen 's trainer dieter hecking will be hoping that his side slips under the relegation radar and claims a few scalps in the bundesliga as they bid to stay up against the odds . nothing is settled and anything can happen .
each club enters the new season on an even keel .
the teams will all start their campaigns with great hope and expectation , something which will roll down from the terraces from the very first whistle to the last .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .
while there has been some transfer action at the allianz arena , with germany striker lukas podolski adding a new edge to the attack and daniel van buyten bringing some steel to the back four , bayern will be more or less the same team that won the league and cup double for the second year running last time out . with one noticeable exception , of course : michael ballack will be playing his soccer on the lush turfs of the english premiership for champions chelsea while his old team mates toil over the pitches of his homeland .
how bayern cope without the talismanic germany captain may be the story of their season .
but with such a depth in the squad and midfielders such as owen hargreaves ready to stand up and be counted in the commander 's role , felix magath 's team are unlikely to struggle . hamburg , werder chasi n g agai n as with every season , bayern start as favorites .
but who will be their main contenders ?
last season , hamburg sv bounced back from an almost disastrous flirtation with relegation a year before to fight the champions for the title .
despite losing van buyten to their main rivals , hsv will be boosted by the return to action of rafael van der vaart and the arrival of bayern 's unwanted striker paulo guerrero .
if thomas doll can avoid the kind of mid-season wobble that put paid to hsv 's title aspirations and saw them finish third , bayern can expect some sleepless nights dreaming about the results rolling in at the aol arena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have already drawn first blood against bayern there or thereabouts will be werder bremen again .
it would take a fool to write off thomas schaaf 's perennial title contenders who ended up as runners-up last year and who have already won the league cup , beating bayern 2-0 last saturday . with experienced world cup players such as miroslav klose , torsten frings and tim borowski and new brazilian midfield maestro diego from fc porto , werder again look a force to be reckoned with .
if golden boot winner klose and strike partner ivan klasnic can connect as well as they did last season , and if frings and diego can provide the ammunition , bundesliga fans can expect another bumper goal tally from bremen … and maybe a championship title ? followi n g pack looki n g to improve a number of the following pack from last season could get it together to challenge this season .
schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .
the unpredictable striker 's responsibilities will be taken over by former red star belgrade forward marko pantelic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david odonkor , with oliver neuville , was a surprise hit borussia dortmund will also be hoping to improve on the last few seasons of underachievement but will have to do so without the czech republic pair tomas rosicky and jan koller who have moved on to pastures new . bvb 's close season signings nelson valdez and alex frei will be hoping to fill the considerable shoes of the departed dortmund icons .
world cup surprise package david odonkor will also be looking to transfer his international pace and impact to the domestic stage to help bvb scale almost-forgotten heights . also-ra n s will plod o n as n ew boys look to stay up meanwhile , as the perennial also-rans look forward to battling their way out of obscurity with the possible lure of a uefa cup spot their only reward for a season of toil , the new boys will be hoping to avoid a swift return to the second division . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfl star benny auer vfl bochum will not be suffering any nosebleeds in the heady heights of the first division .
the elevators , known as such due to their propensity for relegation and promotion in alternating seasons , will know what is needed to stay up - but the question will remain whether marcel koller 's team has the quality to survive . energie cottbus are back in the big time and are the only east german side in the league this year .
they intend to be there next season too despite predictions already putting them in pole position to be the first team down while alemannia aachen 's trainer dieter hecking will be hoping that his side slips under the relegation radar and claims a few scalps in the bundesliga as they bid to stay up against the odds . nothing is settled and anything can happen .
each club enters the new season on an even keel .
the teams will all start their campaigns with great hope and expectation , something which will roll down from the terraces from the very first whistle to the last .
soccer is back in germany and the 2006/07 bundesliga season could be one of the most memorable for a long time . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early blow to bayern as bremen win league cup werder bremen picked up the first piece of silverware in the 2006/07 season defeating bayern munich 2-0 in leipzig on saturday to lift the league cup for the first time in their history .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

" brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .

whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf .

" furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

according to a government spokesperson , it came out ahead of the competition because it offered the best value for money . but eyebrows were raised when the decision was announced , because one of evisco 's directors is jürgen hausmann , the son-in-law of merkel 's political cohort , edmund stoiber . stoiber , the premier of bavaria , also heads the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are close political allies " relationships did not play a role in the awarding of the contract , " hausmann told the augsburger allgemeinen newspaper .

" the financial times deutschland reported that the contract to produce the podcasts until the end of the year is worth 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- . the company that had been producing merkel 's weekly videos since the beginning of june reportedly wanted more money to continue the job . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new vodcasting star is born : german chancellor merkel german chancellor merkel , already known for her speedy cell-phone text-messaging skills , is now entering the world of digital media as the first head of state to address her nation via a video podcast .

politicians from the ruling conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a rethink of germany 's security concept . " we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .

" we have to ask ourselves whether we would have been as successful with our security measures , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers across europe were stranded due to flight delays after the british bomb scare " we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks , " bosbach said , referring to reports that terrorists planned to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage on flights from britain to the us . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the cdu , said germany had to be prepared for an abstract and heightened terror threat . " we are also in the sights of the terrorists , " beckstein said . conservatives demand central anti-terror register conservative politicians are also in favor of introducing a germany-wide anti-terrorism register , which has been a bone of contention for months between the government and the federal states . the planned register would not just contain a database of suspects and groups , but would also list names and details of foundations and companies with possible links to the islamist scene .
the idea is that all security , intelligence and counter-crime agencies both at the state and federal level would have access to the register . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say germany 's security agencies are too bogged down in red tape on friday , beckstein said that the events in britain showed that germany needed a closer networking of its myriad security agencies if quick decisions needed to be taken in an emergency .
cooperation between the various agencies is too slow and bureaucratic at present , beckstein said . " a germany-wide anti-terrorism register is urgently needed , " beckstein said , adding that security loopholes in german counter-terrorism laws also needed to be closed . hartmut koschyk , csu domestic security expert , said the government needed to agree on a legal framework that would allow the army to counter terrorist attacks in the air and on water . he also demanded that the states be more careful about selecting people for naturalization . " there are extremists who deliberately seek the protection of german citizenship , " he said . opposition : security worries exaggerated opposition politicians strongly object to the proposals , saying the conservatives ' security concerns are overblown . fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the green party said it was important that there is good cooperation between the police and intelligence agencies , but said he was against the idea of a national anti-terror register that would enable the police to automatically access all intelligence information . kuhn added that the current practice of information-sharing was " completely sufficient . " " it 's important that we first see what exactly happened in england , " kuhn said .
" the decisive thing is that security checks at airports have to be improved . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp also called for a more level-headed discussion . " the citizens should n't be made uneasy without a well-founded reason , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said , adding that she did n't think germany was facing an increased terrorist threat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says a concerted effort to fight terrorism is needed european union security and justice commissioner franco frattini said that british police 's foiling of a plot to bomb transatlantic flights highlighted the need for " concerted " efforts to fight terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .

" " we live in a dangerous world . "
that is us president george w. bush 's response to the major security alarm that rippled through london 's heathrow airport and in the us after british police officers said they had thwarted a major terrorist attack on several translatlantic flights .
had the terrorists succeeded , officials said , their plot could have cost as many lives as the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us . one had to reckon with the increased threat of fresh terror attacks as the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in manhattan draws near .
after all , the " war on terror " called for and conducted by washington has not been able to put an end to this nuisance . president bush may have announced that people are now safer in the us than they were five years ago , but he also concedes that this safety is not yet 100 percent . indeed , it is not .
on the contrary : since bush has declared war on - what he calls - the " islamic fascists , " terrorism has encroached on countries where it had previously been unknown .
the most glaring example is surely iraq , but peace and calm have also not yet been restored in afghanistan .
and europe has likewise had its first nasty experiences in this regard - in madrid and london .
in this framework , the president 's confidence appears like mockery when he says officials are getting terrorism under control .
but it does no good to try to deal with george w. bush 's forced optimism .
we - in europe and elsewhere around the world - must increasingly deal with the problem on various levels . " western societies must address muslim minorities " one level , of course , consists of security officials who must ensure that innocent people are not harmed again .
another level is that of western societies , which - especially in europe and most especially in great britain - have problems with their muslim minorities : they are poorly integrated , are eyed suspiciously and feel visibly neglected .
it is the best breeding ground for feeble minds who feel such injustices to take revenge . lastly , the international political situation also plays a role , particularly now , when israel is conducting war in lebanon and gaza and is apparently enjoying boundless support from the us and britain .
and , also when other western nations demonstrate their incompetence to put a stop to the blood bath on a daily basis .
the view is crassly simplified and wrong , but nonetheless widespread in the islamic world and among muslims in countries such as great britain : namely , that this is a war against islam .
yet this is the only explanation for the apparently respectable fellow citizens who suddenly become " jihadists " - fighters of the " holy war . " the described problems can not be solved in days or months now .
the five years since sept .
11 have also not been enough .
but people in the west have allowed themselves to be guided by the rallying cries from washington too much and have believed that terrorism can be conquered with military means .
a crudely false estimation whose fatal consequences israel is also now experiencing in lebanon . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and middle east expert . translated from the original text -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin brandauer 's betrayal of brecht culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.08.2006 " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht radically changed theater , both technically and politically bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world 50 years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

their rivals are out to stop number 21 the world cup came to an end barely a month ago and yet germany is already bracing for another feast of soccer as the bundesliga season kicks-off friday .
can the euphoria of the summer carry german soccer to new heights ? the soccer-loving public of germany has barely had time to draw breath since the end of the host nation 's phenomenally successful world cup .
while the national team did n't complete the dream of winning the title on home soil , the euphoria of following jürgen klinsmann 's young team to the semi-final will surely surface again in club colors this week as the 2006/07 bundesliga season kicks-off . after a month of adrenaline and sun-soaked international soccer action , germany 's fans will once more splinter into partisan allegiances to follow their teams through another season of championship cut-and-thrust once title holders bayern munich and borussia dortmund get things underway on friday . bayern will be chasing another league success to further extend their record-breaking list of championship wins ; this season the bavarian giants will be looking for number 21 .
while there has been some transfer action at the allianz arena , with germany striker lukas podolski adding a new edge to the attack and daniel van buyten bringing some steel to the back four , bayern will be more or less the same team that won the league and cup double for the second year running last time out . with one noticeable exception , of course : michael ballack will be playing his soccer on the lush turfs of the english premiership for champions chelsea while his old team mates toil over the pitches of his homeland .
how bayern cope without the talismanic germany captain may be the story of their season .
but with such a depth in the squad and midfielders such as owen hargreaves ready to stand up and be counted in the commander 's role , felix magath 's team are unlikely to struggle . hamburg , werder chasi n g agai n as with every season , bayern start as favorites .
but who will be their main contenders ?
last season , hamburg sv bounced back from an almost disastrous flirtation with relegation a year before to fight the champions for the title .
despite losing van buyten to their main rivals , hsv will be boosted by the return to action of rafael van der vaart and the arrival of bayern 's unwanted striker paulo guerrero .
if thomas doll can avoid the kind of mid-season wobble that put paid to hsv 's title aspirations and saw them finish third , bayern can expect some sleepless nights dreaming about the results rolling in at the aol arena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have already drawn first blood against bayern there or thereabouts will be werder bremen again .
it would take a fool to write off thomas schaaf 's perennial title contenders who ended up as runners-up last year and who have already won the league cup , beating bayern 2-0 last saturday . with experienced world cup players such as miroslav klose , torsten frings and tim borowski and new brazilian midfield maestro diego from fc porto , werder again look a force to be reckoned with .
if golden boot winner klose and strike partner ivan klasnic can connect as well as they did last season , and if frings and diego can provide the ammunition , bundesliga fans can expect another bumper goal tally from bremen … and maybe a championship title ? followi n g pack looki n g to improve a number of the following pack from last season could get it together to challenge this season .
schalke 04 will be hoping that kevin kuranyi puts his nightmare season and his disappointment at missing out on the world cup behind him and starts to hit the goals they need to force their way into contention again while bayer leverkusen will be looking to new signing sergei barbarez from hsv to fill the void left by dimitar berbatov 's departure to tottenham hotspur . hertha berlin start their quest for a better position than last year 's sixth without marcelinho who has departed for turkey .

dortmund have the first chance to bring down the bavarians in the bundesliga 's opening match . as usual bayern start as favorites to collect a third successive crown and 21st title overall , but the summer departure of german international captain michael ballack to english champions chelsea has given their rivals renewed hope . without ballack bayern collapsed to a 2-0 defeat in saturday 's league cup final against werder bremen and then lost an exhibition match 3-0 to second division 1860 munich on wednesday . " nothing happened on offense or defense , " said bayern and france defender willy sagnol .
" it was a catastrophe . " manager felix magath said his players are still drained after this summer 's world cup where 10 bayern players - significantly more than any of their bundesliga rivals - were actively involved . can poldi provide the goals bayern need ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , right , gave everything he had in preseason training " we always said we would have problems at the start of the season as a result of the world cup , " magath said , adding that the team knows what it needs to do to improve .
" we are shooting too few goals - we have to change that by friday . " bayern will be looking for new acquisition lukas podolski , who cost munich 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- to take on goal scoring duties while other newcomer daniel van buyten will shore up the defense in their bayern debuts on friday . even as dortmund 's new signings of swiss striker alexander frei and paraguayan star nelson valdez reach top fitness and captain christian wörns still serving a bench sentence from last season , coach bert van marwijk said he is not concerned about the state of his team " we can go to munich without being afraid , " he said .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

"
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .

at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

" -lrb- thursday 's -rrb- events show once more that terrorism is a continuous and global threat in europe and in other parts of the world , which calls for a constant , concerted response from all european countries , institutions and peoples , " frattini said . " the european union 's counter-terrorism policies in all its dimensions , including prevention , protection , prosecution and response , will be implemented with full vigor to this end , " he added . he was responding to a terrorist threat announced thursday which saw security increased at airports across the globe after british police said they had foiled a plot to blow up flights to the united states with explosives hidden in hand baggage . london 's heathrow airport , one of the busiest in the world , was effectively closed to incoming flights , seriously disrupting air travel in europe . eu transport commissioner jacques barrot welcomed efforts from european air traffic control coordinator eurocontrol , which prevented flights from taking off for heathrow and helped reroute european flights already on their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us carriers continental , american and united were apparent targets from london " the aviation industry showed great solidarity in very difficult circumstances , " he said . the plot unravels meanwhile , the british daily the guardian reported that the british suicide bombers were within days of blowing up 12 passenger jets above us cities . some observers have speculated that the bombings could have coincided with the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the us . the guardian wrote that anti-terrorist specialists had uncovered the plot by watching a group of young british muslims .
surveillance began nearly a year ago and plans for suicide bombings would have been on a dimension unfathomed until now . us and british officials claimed that the majority of the plotters were british muslims of pakistani descent who intended to carry liquid explosives in beverage bottles in their hand luggage on flights headed to the us from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight at all uk airports , including gatwick , causing long lines the guardian wrote that security officials believed that once the jets were in the air over american cities , the plotters intended to mix the explosives and detonate them using an electrical charge from an ipod .

" -lrb- thursday 's -rrb- events show once more that terrorism is a continuous and global threat in europe and in other parts of the world , which calls for a constant , concerted response from all european countries , institutions and peoples , " frattini said . " the european union 's counter-terrorism policies in all its dimensions , including prevention , protection , prosecution and response , will be implemented with full vigor to this end , " he added . he was responding to a terrorist threat announced thursday which saw security increased at airports across the globe after british police said they had foiled a plot to blow up flights to the united states with explosives hidden in hand baggage . london 's heathrow airport , one of the busiest in the world , was effectively closed to incoming flights , seriously disrupting air travel in europe . eu transport commissioner jacques barrot welcomed efforts from european air traffic control coordinator eurocontrol , which prevented flights from taking off for heathrow and helped reroute european flights already on their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us carriers continental , american and united were apparent targets from london " the aviation industry showed great solidarity in very difficult circumstances , " he said . the plot unravels meanwhile , the british daily the guardian reported that the british suicide bombers were within days of blowing up 12 passenger jets above us cities . some observers have speculated that the bombings could have coincided with the fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks in the us . the guardian wrote that anti-terrorist specialists had uncovered the plot by watching a group of young british muslims .
surveillance began nearly a year ago and plans for suicide bombings would have been on a dimension unfathomed until now . us and british officials claimed that the majority of the plotters were british muslims of pakistani descent who intended to carry liquid explosives in beverage bottles in their hand luggage on flights headed to the us from britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight at all uk airports , including gatwick , causing long lines the guardian wrote that security officials believed that once the jets were in the air over american cities , the plotters intended to mix the explosives and detonate them using an electrical charge from an ipod .
apparently , the suicide-bombers-to-be had targeted new york , washington , san francisco , boston and los angeles . had the plot succeeded , it would have meant the possible loss of thousands of lives . pakistan-afghanistan border arrest british police were tipped off following an arrest on pakistan 's border to afghanistan two weeks ago , a pakistani government official said .
that sent the british police into action on thursday , after they intercepted a message from pakistan telling the bombers to " go now , " the guardian wrote . while police had intended to move in on the cells within the next few days , the intercepted message forced them to act early thursday . british police arrested 24 suspects on thursday , one of whom may have worked at heathrow airport .
there are claims , however , that up to 50 people might have been involved in the plot ; police officers are still on the hunt . the bank of england on firday froze the assets of 19 of the arrested suspects , and also released their names . speculations likewise exist that other plotters may now decide to act more quickly out of fear of exposure by the suspects arrested yesterday or that police may discover them . high alert security is still at high alert in at britsh , us and continental european airports . news agencies reported that indian officials have received information that militants may be planning to carry out bombings on us airline carriers leaving new delhi and mumbai in the coming days , perhaps on august 15 , india 's independence day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2006 berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german protestors also joined in the condemnation of the exhibition in berlin a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders . speaking to reporters at the site of the former nazi concentration camp stutthof , in present-day northwestern poland , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski called the exhibition " a bad , worrying and sad event " and said : " it is not doing anything positive for poland , germany or europe . "
the exhibition called " paths unchosen " is organized by the center against expulsions - a body that is closely linked to the league of german expellees who represent some 12.5 million germans who were kicked out from eastern parts of the defeated third reich after world war ii .
the league , led by erika steinbach , a member of germany 's ruling christian democratic party , has stirred anger with plans to set up a permanent expellees ' center in berlin .
in recent years , the league has changed its tone , insisting that the center would not only focus on the plight of germans , but have a european outlook .
poland says show attempt to rewrite history poland 's conservative government and many poles however believe the organization aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 .
after germany 's defeat , poland 's borders were redrawn and shifted west and many germans were forced to flee .
thousands died on the trek from poland , hungary and what was then czechoslovakia .
at the same time , poles from the east of the country were uprooted from land which became part of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition kaczynski said the exhibition was an attempt to rewrite history and realized fears in the run-up to the show that it would be seen by germany 's eastern neighbors as a bid to obscure the nazis ' role in world war ii and the mass displacement that followed .
" it 's an attempt to relativize the history of world war ii , " he said .
" it 's important to remember who the murderers were and who the victims , " he said .
organizers stress show 's european focus the planned project of setting up a permanent center for expellees ' in berlin remains a sticking point between germany and its neighbors , poland and the czech republic .
though the project is bitterly opposed by some german politicians , including former chancellor gerhard schröder , current leader angela merkel and her party are in favor of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach is a deeply controversial figure in an address marking the opening of the exhibition on thursday , erika steinbach said the show was meant to commemorate all the victims of forced expulsion in europe , not just germans .
the exhibition gives space to the suffering not only of germans but of people throughout the continent who were displaced by conflict , including in poland , the balkans and armenia .
at the same time steinbach said criticism of the project needed to be taken seriously .
" i think it ’ s necessary for germans to be aware of these fears and worries , " steinbach said .
" there is a need to deal with our history in its entirety , and we are trying to explain it and put the various facets into their proper context , " she said .
" and who would deny that the large-scale expulsion of germans after the second world war is part of our history ?
after all almost a quarter of the german population was affected by it , so you can ’ t really ignore it . "
historian wilfried rogasch , who conceived the idea for the exhibition pointed out that the exhibition is not solely a german endeavour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photograph displayed at the exhibition " the individual exhibits on various episodes in european history were put together with the help of foreign historians , including scholars from poland , " rogasch said .
he added that criticism from eastern europeans who have n't even seen the exhibition simply is n't fair .
critics unimpressed but not everyone is convinced .
" it is very dangerous to try to reduce the world war two history to the problem of expulsions without mentioning the murder of poles and the holocaust , " poland 's deputy foreign minister pawel kowal told polish news agency pap .
" poland is clearly saying ' no ' to such attempts -lrb- to set up a permanent centre -rrb- . "
the project also remains deeply controversial within germany .
though the exhibition opened thursday without any untoward incident , a group of demonstrators held up placards opposite the show venue , reading " against every revisionism of history . "
the extreme nationalist polish youth group also staged a demonstration .
social democrat lawmaker markus meckel said that it would have been wiser to carry out such a project in consultation with other european countries , notably germany 's eastern neighbors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained . " bertolt brecht is without a doubt the most important and influential dramatist of the twentieth century worldwide , " said stephen brockmann of carnegie-mellon university , who is also a member of the international brecht society . " his influence extends far beyond germany and includes the english-speaking world and much of the third world , " added brockmann . bertolt brecht , a german dramatist , stage director and poet from augsburg , died on aug .
14 , 1956 at the age of 58 .
this year has been declared " bertolt brecht year " in honor of the 50th anniversary of his death . klaus maria brandauer 's new production of " the three penny opera , " scheduled to premiere friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast , is a focal point of the brecht year .
rock star campino from the band die toten hosen will make his theatrical debut as mack the knife . one of few voluntary gdr residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht denied membership in the communist party brecht is largely noted for his communist leanings and politics was a central element in many of his works .
for this reason , he was forced to flee germany when the nazis came to power in 1933 . the dramatist spent the next decade in exile , moving from denmark to sweden , and finland .
he eventually made his way to the us , where he was interrogated by the house un-american activities committee in 1947 . in the hope of finally dodging persecution from communist-wary governments , brecht shortly thereafter became one of few intellectuals to immigrate to soviet-run east germany . brecht received a warm official welcome in the german democratic republic and was touted as a star .
high school teachers used his works to legitimize the state ideology . however , brecht himself never joined the east german communist party and did not spout the party line as much as the state proclaimed . " we appreciated brecht because he did n't fit into the narrow understanding of the official gdr , " said chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in former east germany , in an interview with die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner ensemble performing " the mother " it was n't until brecht 's previously unknown journal notes and poems were published well after his death that the long-standing assumption that he had been a kind of " national poet " for the gdr was laid to rest . relevance in the third world though most of his works were produced prior to world war two , " brecht 's theater was first discovered in paris in 1954 , when ' mother courage ' was performed there , " said jan knopf , director of the bertolt brecht research institute at the university of karlsruhe . " people noticed that brecht 's theater was socially relevant and dealt with real problems in society , " he added . both knopf and brockmann pointed out that brecht was revolutionary in that he drew the audience into his works and encouraged them to think in a whole new way - about theater but also about the society they were living in . " brecht wanted his audiences ' critical stance toward the theater to translate into a critical stance toward society itself , " said brockmann , adding that , while brecht 's theater can also be enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level , it strongly appeals to those working toward social change , particularly in the third world . before the 1988 olympic games , korea needed to prove to the world that it had completed its democratization process .
knopf said that , ironically , brecht 's works were performed in korea at that time as a symbolic gesture that the country was democratically stable enough to host the olympic games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " opens friday in the admiralspalast " brecht 's theater and his theories have had a profound impact on augusto boal 's political theater in brazil , as well as on political theater in south africa , " said brockmann .
" although brecht 's revolutionary political message makes many in the so-called first world uncomfortable now , it resonates strongly with many in the third world . " works like " mahagonny " demonstrate the hypocrisy inherent in capitalist society , he added . shape your world different audiences respond differently , " depending on cultural needs and aesthetic and political expectation , " said antony tatlow from the university of dublin .
whether brecht 's plays are applied to the left or the right of the political spectrum , one thing is for sure : they get the audiences thinking . his influence as a dramatist , however , was not limited to political elements . " he introduced a completely new form of theater , " said knopf .
he described brecht 's typical stage as very well lit and nearly completely free of scenery and props .
brecht divided the stage into two parts with a large white sheet .
texts could be projected onto the sheet , creating an early multi-media theater experience . his didactic plays , called " lehrstücke , " which brecht experimented with between 1929 and 1932 , essentially had no stage at all .
since they could be performed anywhere , the works traveled well and were particularly successful in south america , eastern europe and other places around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helene weigel as mother courage by doing away with cluttered scenery on stage , brecht was able to express his philosophy that people shape their world , not the other way around , said knopf . " this concept can aggravate a lot of people , " said norm roessler from temple university in philadelphia , " because both the performer and audience are constantly called upon to be conscious and sceptical of what they are doing and seeing . " furthermore , brecht 's choice to place the actors in completely new types of roles that keep the audience - and the actors - on their toes .
knopf described how , in " the threepenny opera , " the robbers have to sing even though they are not trained singers , then they change the scenery around , and after that they have to play upstanding citizens . not surprisingly , this technique imbues the play with plenty of humor - after all , one of brecht 's primary goals was to entertain the audience . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .

the bank of japan had said it would only increase rates gradually , having not lifted them for six years prior to last month 's decision .
the rate rise was seen as a sign of the bank 's confidence in the strength of the japanese economy .
the bank also announced that the economy had grown at an annualised rate of 0.8 % between april and june .
although the rate was slower than expected - mainly due to weaker exports to the us - analysts said that the economy should continue to show moderate growth .
japan 's economy - the world 's second largest - has seen growth pick up and unemployment fall in recent months , pushing the country out of the deflationary spiral of recent years .
output has now grown in each of the past six quarters while unemployment is at an eight-year low of about 4 % .

the bank of japan had said it would only increase rates gradually , having not lifted them for six years prior to last month 's decision .
the rate rise was seen as a sign of the bank 's confidence in the strength of the japanese economy .
the bank also announced that the economy had grown at an annualised rate of 0.8 % between april and june .
although the rate was slower than expected - mainly due to weaker exports to the us - analysts said that the economy should continue to show moderate growth .
japan 's economy - the world 's second largest - has seen growth pick up and unemployment fall in recent months , pushing the country out of the deflationary spiral of recent years .
output has now grown in each of the past six quarters while unemployment is at an eight-year low of about 4 % .

thirty years after the formation of the peace people , bbc northern ireland political correspondent martina purdy examines their legacy .
it was described in a bbc report as " part traffic accident , part terrorist incident " .
mairead corrigan made an impassioned plea for peace in truth , it became much more than that in the summer of 1976 .
on 10 august , anne maguire was walking along finaghy road north with her three children when an out-of-control car plunged into them .
the car 's driver , ira man danny lennon , had been fatally wounded by a british army patrol which was chasing him .
the car plunged into the maguires , instantly killing six-week-old baby , andrew , who was in his pram and his eight-year-old sister , joanne , who was on her bicycle .
their brother john , just two-and-a-half , died the following day in hospital .
their mother , anne , was maimed physically and mentally - and would take her own life some years later .
anne 's sister , mairead corrigan , made a grief-stricken appeal on television for peace .
one of the peace people 's biggest rallies was in trafalgar square , london her impassioned appeal struck a chord with a community traumatised by the troubles .
within three days of the awful tragedy , the peace people was born .
led by mairead corrigan and her friend betty williams , the peace people won attention at home and abroad .
the women were soon joined by belfast journalist , ciaran mckeown , among others .
in the weeks and months that followed , they were forming street groups , leading marches , campaigning in the united states against funds for the ira and had even opened their own office .
hundreds of letters were pouring out of post bags , and betty williams issued a defiant message to the gunmen at the opening of the office : " the paramilitaries think we are just a funny little movement .
" this is to let them know we mean business . "
betty williams was a co-founder of the peace people they marched in cities and towns such as belfast , enniskillen and ballymena and held one of their most high profile rallies in trafalgar square in london .
hopes of a 50,000-strong crowd did not materialise .
but more than 10,000 people demonstrated for peace , while legendary folk singer , and political activist joan baez serenaded the crowd with the anthem : " we shall overcome . "
their efforts to bring peace to northern ireland won mairead corrigan and betty williams the nobel prize for 1976 .
but in trafalgar square , a persistent heckler , who shouted : " vengeance for bloody sunday " , was a sign of underlying hostility to their cause .
when the women marched on the falls road , they came under attack from stone-throwing republican youths .
sinn fein 's alex maskey , reflecting on republican attitudes to the peace people , said their good intentions were hijacked by the british government intent on an anti-republican peace .
the best memory we can give in tribute to those who had died is to build the peace in northern ireland mairead corrigan mr maskey said their emotional response touched a chord with a lot of people , but added : " for me and others , the peace people and their good intentions were quickly exploited and absorbed into british state policy . "
mairead corrigan , 30 years on , rejected the criticism .
she insisted the peace people from the beginning were " no-one 's friend . "
she said the peace people were clearly opposed to all forms of violence , condemning paramilitaries " across the board " and challenging state violence .
she said the movement also underscored the need for states to uphold human rights - and had long advocated dialogue as the only solution .
she added : " looking back , i think we got some things right . "
ms corrigan also claimed the peace people helped sow the seeds of peace in northern ireland .
but it is a view challenged by the movement 's critics , who claimed it ultimately failed to make any difference .
commentator brian feeney said their project was " hijacked " by the northern ireland office , its impact " diminished " by rows over the nobel peace prize money and an emotional message that did not fit a complex situation .
the women were attacked on the falls road in belfast " it was too simplistic ... simply to come out in the street and shout for peace and an end to violence , " he said .
" for a huge number of people who had suffered from violence their response was : ' well , what about justice ? " '
whatever the legacy , 30 years on , mairead corrigan continues to work for peace at home and abroad .
this year she was in the middle east and this week took part in an event in belfast to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the atomic bomb on hiroshima .
as she reflects on the deeply personal events of 30 years ago , she remains hopeful good can come from the tragedy .
" the best memory we can give in tribute to those who had died is to build the peace in northern ireland , " she said .

one of the peace people 's biggest rallies was in trafalgar square , london her impassioned appeal struck a chord with a community traumatised by the troubles .
within three days of the awful tragedy , the peace people was born .
led by mairead corrigan and her friend betty williams , the peace people won attention at home and abroad .
the women were soon joined by belfast journalist , ciaran mckeown , among others .
in the weeks and months that followed , they were forming street groups , leading marches , campaigning in the united states against funds for the ira and had even opened their own office .
hundreds of letters were pouring out of post bags , and betty williams issued a defiant message to the gunmen at the opening of the office : " the paramilitaries think we are just a funny little movement .
" this is to let them know we mean business . "
betty williams was a co-founder of the peace people they marched in cities and towns such as belfast , enniskillen and ballymena and held one of their most high profile rallies in trafalgar square in london .
hopes of a 50,000-strong crowd did not materialise .
but more than 10,000 people demonstrated for peace , while legendary folk singer , and political activist joan baez serenaded the crowd with the anthem : " we shall overcome . "
their efforts to bring peace to northern ireland won mairead corrigan and betty williams the nobel prize for 1976 .
but in trafalgar square , a persistent heckler , who shouted : " vengeance for bloody sunday " , was a sign of underlying hostility to their cause .
when the women marched on the falls road , they came under attack from stone-throwing republican youths .
sinn fein 's alex maskey , reflecting on republican attitudes to the peace people , said their good intentions were hijacked by the british government intent on an anti-republican peace .
the best memory we can give in tribute to those who had died is to build the peace in northern ireland mairead corrigan mr maskey said their emotional response touched a chord with a lot of people , but added : " for me and others , the peace people and their good intentions were quickly exploited and absorbed into british state policy . "
mairead corrigan , 30 years on , rejected the criticism .
she insisted the peace people from the beginning were " no-one 's friend . "
she said the peace people were clearly opposed to all forms of violence , condemning paramilitaries " across the board " and challenging state violence .
she said the movement also underscored the need for states to uphold human rights - and had long advocated dialogue as the only solution .
she added : " looking back , i think we got some things right . "
ms corrigan also claimed the peace people helped sow the seeds of peace in northern ireland .
but it is a view challenged by the movement 's critics , who claimed it ultimately failed to make any difference .
commentator brian feeney said their project was " hijacked " by the northern ireland office , its impact " diminished " by rows over the nobel peace prize money and an emotional message that did not fit a complex situation .
the women were attacked on the falls road in belfast " it was too simplistic ... simply to come out in the street and shout for peace and an end to violence , " he said .
" for a huge number of people who had suffered from violence their response was : ' well , what about justice ? " '
whatever the legacy , 30 years on , mairead corrigan continues to work for peace at home and abroad .
this year she was in the middle east and this week took part in an event in belfast to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the atomic bomb on hiroshima .
as she reflects on the deeply personal events of 30 years ago , she remains hopeful good can come from the tragedy .
" the best memory we can give in tribute to those who had died is to build the peace in northern ireland , " she said .

a meeting of key security council members ended without agreement late on thursday .
more talks are due on friday .
however russia says a deal may be a long way off and it plans to table a separate draft calling for a three-day truce for humanitarian purposes .
the un moves came as israel resumed its bombing raids over lebanon .
eleven civilians were killed in a raid in akkar province near the syrian border , while an area of southern beirut was bombed early on friday .
fighting is also continuing between israeli forces and hezbollah guerrillas near the israeli border in southern lebanon .
the israeli army said a soldier was killed in fierce clashes in the western lebanese village of labuneh , and 19 soldiers were injured in fighting across southern lebanon overnight .
earlier , the israeli military confirmed the death of a soldier near the town of marjayoun .
two armoured vehicles from the un peacekeeping force , unifil , have been sent to marjayoun to evacuate some 350 lebanese soldiers and police who are holed up barracks there , lebanese security officials said .
lebanese objections israel says plans agreed on wednesday for an extended ground assault in south lebanon are on hold to give diplomacy a chance .
there is still no agreement at the un on a resolution calling for an end to the fighting . "
war is raging in lebanon and the humanitarian situation is getting catastrophic " vitaly churkin russian ambassador to the un the shadow of iraq un push for breakthrough mid east crisis : key maps lebanon demands an immediate ceasefire and a quick israeli withdrawal .
israel says it will fight until new foreign troops and the lebanese army move in - a position which washington has supported .
on thursday officials expressed optimism that a deal on the wording of a resolution might be reached soon .
the deal is understood to centre on introducing lebanese troops into the border region , strengthening unifil , and giving it a tougher mandate .
at the same time , the text would call on israel to begin a phased withdrawal .
however the lebanese government - which includes hezbollah - appears to be objecting to a strengthened mandate allowing un troops to use force .
a meeting of the five permanent members of the security council late on thursday failed to produce agreement .
' unhelpful ' uk foreign secretary margaret beckett flew to new york , saying she would " reinforce britain 's efforts to reach agreement " .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy are also expected .
press sceptical on diplomacy excerpts : council speeches send us your comments russia , meanwhile , said it was introducing its own draft resolution on a three-day humanitarian truce .
russian ambassador to the un vitaly churkin said this was because there was no deal in sight .
" war is raging in lebanon and the humanitarian situation is getting catastrophic , " he said .
however the russian idea was rejected by israel and described by us ambassador to the un john bolton as " unhelpful " .
the new un human rights council is due to hold an emergency session on the conflict in lebanon on friday .
it was requested mainly by arab states , demanding action on what they describe as " gross human rights violations " by israel .
but israel has criticised the request for a session , because it makes no mention of hezbollah 's attacks .
as of thursday evening , more than 1,000 lebanese , most of them civilians , have now been killed in the month-long conflict , lebanon says .
some 122 israelis , most of them soldiers , have also been killed .

fighting is also continuing between israeli forces and hezbollah guerrillas near the israeli border in southern lebanon .
the israeli army said a soldier was killed in fierce clashes in the western lebanese village of labuneh , and 19 soldiers were injured in fighting across southern lebanon overnight .
earlier , the israeli military confirmed the death of a soldier near the town of marjayoun .
two armoured vehicles from the un peacekeeping force , unifil , have been sent to marjayoun to evacuate some 350 lebanese soldiers and police who are holed up barracks there , lebanese security officials said .

israel says it will fight until new foreign troops and the lebanese army move in - a position which washington has supported .
on thursday officials expressed optimism that a deal on the wording of a resolution might be reached soon .
the deal is understood to centre on introducing lebanese troops into the border region , strengthening unifil , and giving it a tougher mandate .
at the same time , the text would call on israel to begin a phased withdrawal .
however the lebanese government - which includes hezbollah - appears to be objecting to a strengthened mandate allowing un troops to use force .

the new un human rights council is due to hold an emergency session on the conflict in lebanon on friday .
it was requested mainly by arab states , demanding action on what they describe as " gross human rights violations " by israel .

costing $ 1,565 , the 5150 had just 16k of memory - scarcely more than a couple of modest e-mails worth .
the machine was not the first attempt to popularise computing but it soon came to define the global standard .
it altered the way business was done forever and sparked a revolution in home computing .
" it 's hard to imagine what people used to do with computers in those days because by modern standards they really could n't do anything , " said tom standage , the economist magazine 's business editor told the world service 's analysis programme .
" but there were still things you could do with a computer that you could n't do without it like spreadsheets and word processing . "
global impact everything from automated spreadsheets to desktop publishing and the rise of the internet have since become possible .
the term pc had been in use long before ibm released its machine - but the success of the 5150 led to the use of the term to mean a machine compatible with ibm 's specifications .
the machine was developed by a team of 12 engineers , led by don estridge , who was known as the " father of the ibm pc " .
development took under a year and was achieved by building a machine using " off the shelf " parts from a variety of manufacturers .
the machine had an " open architecture " which meant other firms could produce compatible machines .
ibm banked on being able to charge a license for using the bios - the software which controls the heart of the machine .
but other companies reverse engineered the bios and were able to produce clones of the machine without having to pay ibm a penny .
that open architecture sparked an explosion in pc sales and also paved the way for common standards - something business had craved .
since then the pc has come to dominate the home and the office and led the move to the online era with cheap global communication , e-commerce and for consumers the ability to find the answer to almost any question on the web .
roger kay , president of computer consultancy firm endpoint , said the impact of the pc on all aspects our lives can not be over-stated .
" i have for example an archive of correspondence from people that i diligently wrote letters to and all of a sudden that just stops , " he said .
" i do n't think i 've got a personal letter for five years . "
moving this revolution forward are the one billion pcs that are now in use around the world .
in many ways , the pc has become in the developed world , an essential tool in our everyday lives .
end of an era ?
but for how much longer ?
ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect , told the firm 's shareholders last month the pc era was coming to an end .
" we 're now in a new era , an era in which the internet is at the centre of so much that we do now with our pcs , " he told them .
" and it 's important to start then from a different vantage point . "
with the lion 's share of the microsoft global software empire founded on the success of the pc , mr ozzie 's statement was a significant admission .
mr standage said microsoft has come to recognise that it will inevitably have to move with the times .
he said : " the problem is that microsoft has most to lose from the shift towards internet-based software and that means it has the least incentive to do anything about it because it likes the status quo .
" but if it does n't switch to this new model other people will . "
pc supremacy the move towards internet based software calls into question the supremacy of the pc itself .
vying to knock the pc off its pedestal are a new generation of media pcs that hook up to televisions and hand-held computer devices , from phones to pocket pcs .
with all this small mobile technology and the growth of wireless internet , will people on the move bother owning a pc at all ?
reports of the pc 's demise may be a little premature .
while the market may not be growing anymore , it remains an industry generating some $ 200bn a year .
in developing countries such as china and latin america , the pc market is still expanding at double digit growth rates .
but the development of mobile technology may enable the developing world to leapfrog the pc era altogether .
mr standage said mobile technology is key to sharing the benefits of the pc age with developing countries .
" i think that adding features to mobile phones is probably a better way to democratise computing , " he said .

end of an era ?

ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect , told the firm 's shareholders last month the pc era was coming to an end .

he said : " the problem is that microsoft has most to lose from the shift towards internet-based software and that means it has the least incentive to do anything about it because it likes the status quo .

reports of the pc 's demise may be a little premature .
while the market may not be growing anymore , it remains an industry generating some $ 200bn a year .
in developing countries such as china and latin america , the pc market is still expanding at double digit growth rates .
but the development of mobile technology may enable the developing world to leapfrog the pc era altogether .
mr standage said mobile technology is key to sharing the benefits of the pc age with developing countries .

" i have for example an archive of correspondence from people that i diligently wrote letters to and all of a sudden that just stops , " he said .
" i do n't think i 've got a personal letter for five years . "
moving this revolution forward are the one billion pcs that are now in use around the world .
in many ways , the pc has become in the developed world , an essential tool in our everyday lives .
end of an era ?
but for how much longer ?
ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect , told the firm 's shareholders last month the pc era was coming to an end .
" we 're now in a new era , an era in which the internet is at the centre of so much that we do now with our pcs , " he told them .
" and it 's important to start then from a different vantage point . "
mobile technology could make pcs obsolete with the lion 's share of the microsoft global software empire founded on the success of the pc , mr ozzie 's statement was a significant admission .
mr standage said microsoft has come to recognise that it will inevitably have to move with the times .
he said : " the problem is that microsoft has most to lose from the shift towards internet-based software and that means it has the least incentive to do anything about it because it likes the status quo .
" but if it does n't switch to this new model other people will . "
pc supremacy the move towards internet based software calls into question the supremacy of the pc itself .
vying to knock the pc off its pedestal are a new generation of media pcs that hook up to televisions and hand-held computer devices , from phones to pocket pcs .
with all this small mobile technology and the growth of wireless internet , will people on the move bother owning a pc at all ?
reports of the pc 's demise may be a little premature .
while the market may not be growing anymore , it remains an industry generating some $ 200bn a year .
in developing countries such as china and latin america , the pc market is still expanding at double digit growth rates .
but the development of mobile technology may enable the developing world to leapfrog the pc era altogether .
mr standage said mobile technology is key to sharing the benefits of the pc age with developing countries .
" i think that adding features to mobile phones is probably a better way to democratise computing , " he said .

costing $ 1,565 , the 5150 had just 16k of memory - scarcely more than a couple of modest e-mails worth .
the machine was not the first attempt to popularise computing but it soon came to define the global standard .
it altered the way business was done forever and sparked a revolution in home computing .
" it 's hard to imagine what people used to do with computers in those days because by modern standards they really could n't do anything , " said tom standage , the economist magazine 's business editor told the world service 's analysis programme .
" but there were still things you could do with a computer that you could n't do without it like spreadsheets and word processing . "
global impact everything from automated spreadsheets to desktop publishing and the rise of the internet have since become possible .
how the pc has changed in the last 25 years in pictures the term pc had been in use long before ibm released its machine - but the success of the 5150 led to the use of the term to mean a machine compatible with ibm 's specifications .
the machine was developed by a team of 12 engineers , led by don estridge , who was known as the " father of the ibm pc " .
development took under a year and was achieved by building a machine using " off the shelf " parts from a variety of manufacturers .
the machine had an " open architecture " which meant other firms could produce compatible machines .
ibm banked on being able to charge a license for using the bios - the software which controls the heart of the machine .
but other companies reverse engineered the bios and were able to produce clones of the machine without having to pay ibm a penny .
that open architecture sparked an explosion in pc sales and also paved the way for common standards - something business had craved .

some 2,700 complaints have been sent to icstis from viewers unhappy at being asked to vote again for contestants they thought had left for good .
the inquiry could result in channel 4 refunding an estimated £ 3m to people who took part with phone or text votes .
meanwhile , either imogen thomas or richard newman will leave on friday .
they joined the four returning contestants - grace adams-short , lea walker , mikey dalton and nikki graham - in a separate house next door following nominations .
imogen is the runaway favourite to be evicted in the public vote , according to bookmaker william hill .
it has given odds of 1/33 that she will go , compared to 10/1 for richard . "
the majority of the complainants believe that they have been misled as they were under the impression that they had voted to evict the contestants permanently " icstis statement on friday evening , the housemate who survives the public vote will return to the main house with a former evictee .
the remaining housemates will have to choose which of the four they want to rejoin them in the house for the final week .
nikki is the 1/4 favourite , with lea at 11/4 , mikey at 16/1 and grace - who is celebrating her 21st birthday - as the outsider on 20/1 .
' must not mislead ' icstis is checking whether big brother breached its code of practice by asking viewers to vote for their return to the show .
this states that " services and promotional material must not mislead , or be likely to mislead , by inaccuracy , ambiguity , exaggeration , omission or otherwise " .
" the majority of the complainants believe that they have been misled as they were under the impression that they had voted to evict the contestants permanently , " the regulator 's statement said .
it could decide to fine big brother 's premium rate service providers up to £ 250,000 or bar their phone lines and text voting facilities .
alternatively it may rule that guidelines have been followed and that there is no case to answer .
the icstis investigation is expected to take no more than three months .
