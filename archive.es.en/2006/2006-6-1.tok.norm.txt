program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.06.2006 another german state bans headscarf for teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the ban is unconstitutional germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , joins seven other states in forbidding teachers in public schools from wearing the muslim headscarf . the law banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves was adopted on wednesday by the regional parliament of the western state of north-rhine westphalia , where the conservative christian democrats hold a majority .
the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .

although northern afghanistan is quieter than the east and the south , german brigadier general markus kneip described the situation there as " not calm and unstable . " the head of germany 's armed forces association , bernhard gertz , expressed his doubts about the overall order of the international peace mission .
in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung , he said germany 's mission was n't based on a " sound concept . "
gertz was also critical of the division of responsibilities between the countries involved , which he said did not function properly .

us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.06.2006 another german state bans headscarf for teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the ban is unconstitutional germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , joins seven other states in forbidding teachers in public schools from wearing the muslim headscarf . the law banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves was adopted on wednesday by the regional parliament of the western state of north-rhine westphalia , where the conservative christian democrats hold a majority .
the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .
still , in some states such as berlin , the wearing of headscarves by muslims is banned for all civil servants . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school suspends burka-clad students a high school in the german city of bonn has suspended two muslim girls for wearing a burka , an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central and south asia .

but iran said thursday it wo n't accept . the european union hailed the unites states ' conditional offer to join direct talks on iran 's nuclear program , saying it strengthens their hand in negotiations with tehran . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , who along with his british and german counterparts has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to engage tehran , said the us policy shift " reinforces the credibility " of europe 's efforts . in berlin , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of the vienna talks thursday that washington 's offer was " a real strengthening of american efforts . " " i see a window opening " which could bring about a solution , steinmeier said , flanked by his dutch counterpart ben bot .
both ministers said they hoped iran would understand the significance of the offer and seize the opportunity . first us direct talks with iran in decades the us offer came on the eve of a meeting in the austrian capital of the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , russia , france , britain and china - plus germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful specifically , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington is ready to join direct talks with europe on iran 's nuclear program if tehran suspends all uranium enrichment activities . she made the offer of the first substantive talks with iran since diplomatic ties were broken off 26 years ago as she prepared to leave for the crucial meeting of world powers in vienna on tehran 's suspected nuclear arms program . " to underscore our commitment to a diplomatic solution and to enhance the prospects for success , as soon as iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities , the united states will come to the table with our eu-3 colleagues and meet with iran 's representatives , " she said . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said us participation " would be the strongest and most positive signal of our common wish to reach an agreement with iran . " " this important statement by the us administration reinforces our hope that out of the current discussions we will be able to establish a new and cooperative relationship with iran , based on mutual confidence , " he said . chance of tack one eu diplomat said the us change of tack could be decisive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says that giving up its nuclear activities is not a possibility " when you add the us to direct negotiations , a country which has not had direct relations with iran since the arrival of khomeini ... the value of the negotiations changes substantially , " he said .
" it is a very important signal of the commitment of the us and their desire to see the negotiations succeed . " washington heavily backed the former iranian imperial regime of the shah , which was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an islamic republic headed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , visiting turkey wednesday , said , " we hope the way will be open to a political solution after the talks in vienna . " iranian reluctancce but iran on thursday rejected us conditions for talks , saying it was ready for negotiations but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . " we support dialogue in a fair and unbiased atmosphere , but we will not talk about our undeniable and legitimate rights , because this is the right of our people according to international laws and treaties , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters .
" we are ready to talk about common concerns and if the conditions are such in a way that we have outlined ... we are ready to negotiate with all parties . " mottaki said that rice 's statement - which also touched on us concerns over iran 's human rights record and its alleged support for terrorism - " did not have any new words in it . " " they have repeated their old words .
a new solution and a logical solution for the nuclear issue was not seen in the declaration , " said mottaki , giving the islamic republic 's first reaction to the us proposal .
" maybe they wanted to cover up their crimes in the region .
first and foremost , the us should be held accountable for their crimes in iraq , afghanistan , the prisons of guantanamo and -lrb- baghdad 's -rrb- abu ghraib -lrb- jail -rrb- .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .
still , in some states such as berlin , the wearing of headscarves by muslims is banned for all civil servants . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school suspends burka-clad students a high school in the german city of bonn has suspended two muslim girls for wearing a burka , an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central and south asia .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information . " we are clearly in a rather embarrassing situation now , " the spokesman said .
" it is highly regrettable but it ca n't be changed . " bad timi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embarrassing report in may detailed how the agency spied on journalists or paid them to spy on others a new special parliamentary committee set up to examine the role and activities of the bnd as part of the war on terrorism is currently preparing to question al-masri and german officials over the matter .
the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .
the us also denies torturing suspects or handing them over to countries that do so . the admission also comes on the heel of a controversial report last week issued by parliamentary investigators that confirmed that the intelligence agency spied on german journalists until a few months ago and paid journalists to spy on their colleagues . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information . " we are clearly in a rather embarrassing situation now , " the spokesman said .
" it is highly regrettable but it ca n't be changed . " bad timi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embarrassing report in may detailed how the agency spied on journalists or paid them to spy on others a new special parliamentary committee set up to examine the role and activities of the bnd as part of the war on terrorism is currently preparing to question al-masri and german officials over the matter .
the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .
the us also denies torturing suspects or handing them over to countries that do so . the admission also comes on the heel of a controversial report last week issued by parliamentary investigators that confirmed that the intelligence agency spied on german journalists until a few months ago and paid journalists to spy on their colleagues . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .
a democratic election brought militant group hamas to power in palestine .
and iran continues to resist appeals to cease its nuclear activities . as a result , the eighth annual german world bank forum , on thursday and friday , is bringing together representatives of the political , business and academic communities to refocus attention on ties between germany and the region and identify opportunities for enhanced political and economic cooperation . the forum , titled , " germany and the middle east : change and opportunities , " wo n't focus on the boycott of hamas or even iran 's nuclear activities .
instead , topping the agenda is how to increase technical , educational , political and especially economic cooperation and social contact . " the region has important business potential , particularly for germans , " said alexander neunzig of the hamburg chamber of commerce , a partner in the forum .
" and increased business relationships are a prerequisite for improved political ties , better economic development in the region and peace . " billions in trade german trade with the region amounts to billions annually .
with countries such as iran or saudi arabia , annual trade is 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- and 5.4 billion euros respectively , according to the hamburg chamber of commerce .
the main areas of trade are chemical and industrial products and machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president paul wolfowitz is expected to urge more german development help as a result , some fear that german business could suffer if political relations between arab nations and the west deteriorate .
germany , who opposed the iraq war , has been in the forefront regarding iran and palestine , leading some in the german business community to become nervous . " we need to examine where the middle east is heading , " said peter goepfrich , executive director of the german-arab chamber of commerce .
" we also need to take a look at the widening gap in relations .
on the one hand , there is an economic boom in the region ; on the other , there is an escalation of political tensions . " germany has a good reputation in the region , built over many years .
much of that is due to the prestige of its products as much as personal interaction and trust-building in business relationships .
this will help insulate german business from politics , experts say . " even if the political situation gets tenser , our business relationships are strong and much more stable and should be fine , " said neunzig .
" we even have businessmen coming from iran and iraq to the forum . " a slow renaissance there is also an increasing interest in germany in enhancing political ties since the september 11 attacks in new york . " a policy shift is too strong a description , " said katja niethammer , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" but the past social democratic-green party government gave a new accentuation to the region and germany became more visible . " the war in iraq and germany 's opposition to it also enhanced the country 's standing in the region , say experts .
although it has also led to some misunderstandings as arab countries expect germany to side with them against the us in other issues .

" " they have repeated their old words .
a new solution and a logical solution for the nuclear issue was not seen in the declaration , " said mottaki , giving the islamic republic 's first reaction to the us proposal .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .
he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .
the army was not prepared for africa , and there were worries about the high aids rate and the climate , he said . troops will help stabilize country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have already been deployed to dr congo politicians from both ruling parties have rejected the criticism .
social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .
" all things considered , we say that it 's right to send german soldiers to dr congo , " greens parliamentary chief fritz kuhn said .
only then would the congolese be able to improve their lives . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .

but iran said thursday it wo n't accept . the european union hailed the unites states ' conditional offer to join direct talks on iran 's nuclear program , saying it strengthens their hand in negotiations with tehran . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , who along with his british and german counterparts has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to engage tehran , said the us policy shift " reinforces the credibility " of europe 's efforts . in berlin , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of the vienna talks thursday that washington 's offer was " a real strengthening of american efforts . " " i see a window opening " which could bring about a solution , steinmeier said , flanked by his dutch counterpart ben bot .
both ministers said they hoped iran would understand the significance of the offer and seize the opportunity . first us direct talks with iran in decades the us offer came on the eve of a meeting in the austrian capital of the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , russia , france , britain and china - plus germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful specifically , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington is ready to join direct talks with europe on iran 's nuclear program if tehran suspends all uranium enrichment activities . she made the offer of the first substantive talks with iran since diplomatic ties were broken off 26 years ago as she prepared to leave for the crucial meeting of world powers in vienna on tehran 's suspected nuclear arms program . " to underscore our commitment to a diplomatic solution and to enhance the prospects for success , as soon as iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities , the united states will come to the table with our eu-3 colleagues and meet with iran 's representatives , " she said . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said us participation " would be the strongest and most positive signal of our common wish to reach an agreement with iran .

" it is a very important signal of the commitment of the us and their desire to see the negotiations succeed . " washington heavily backed the former iranian imperial regime of the shah , which was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an islamic republic headed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , visiting turkey wednesday , said , " we hope the way will be open to a political solution after the talks in vienna . " iranian reluctancce but iran on thursday rejected us conditions for talks , saying it was ready for negotiations but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . " we support dialogue in a fair and unbiased atmosphere , but we will not talk about our undeniable and legitimate rights , because this is the right of our people according to international laws and treaties , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters .
" we are ready to talk about common concerns and if the conditions are such in a way that we have outlined ... we are ready to negotiate with all parties . " mottaki said that rice 's statement - which also touched on us concerns over iran 's human rights record and its alleged support for terrorism - " did not have any new words in it . " " they have repeated their old words .
a new solution and a logical solution for the nuclear issue was not seen in the declaration , " said mottaki , giving the islamic republic 's first reaction to the us proposal .
" maybe they wanted to cover up their crimes in the region .
first and foremost , the us should be held accountable for their crimes in iraq , afghanistan , the prisons of guantanamo and -lrb- baghdad 's -rrb- abu ghraib -lrb- jail -rrb- .

that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .
still , in some states such as berlin , the wearing of headscarves by muslims is banned for all civil servants . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school suspends burka-clad students a high school in the german city of bonn has suspended two muslim girls for wearing a burka , an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central and south asia .

although northern afghanistan is quieter than the east and the south , german brigadier general markus kneip described the situation there as " not calm and unstable . " the head of germany 's armed forces association , bernhard gertz , expressed his doubts about the overall order of the international peace mission .
in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung , he said germany 's mission was n't based on a " sound concept . "

us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense . " the us ambassador to afghanistan , ronald neumann , told the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung that following the recent unrest in afghanistan , a " bloody summer " was to be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a must if peace is to be achieved in afghanistan " the taliban think that the nato countries are weak and that the europeans will run away if they strike hard now , " he said . neumann complimented the german forces for their engagement thus far , but he warned that the relatively safe north could expect conditions like that in the rest of the country this summer . nato has said that despite the current instability in afghanistan , operations there should be extended to the whole country .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .

baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .

the new responsibility has come at a time when violence has risen in afghanistan , highlighted this week by unrest in kabul and the killing of aid workers in the north . german defense minister franz josef jung described the situation as dangerous for german troops who will be stationed in the city of mazar-i-sharif , in the new area of assignment .
the possibility of isolated ambushes by taliban militia was real , he said . " that is what worries us the most at the moment , " jung told german public television ard on wednesday . some critical of division of duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy plantations , from which heroin is produced , are numerous in the north currently 2,850 german soldiers are part of the nato-led isaf mission .

although northern afghanistan is quieter than the east and the south , german brigadier general markus kneip described the situation there as " not calm and unstable . " the head of germany 's armed forces association , bernhard gertz , expressed his doubts about the overall order of the international peace mission .
in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung , he said germany 's mission was n't based on a " sound concept . "
gertz was also critical of the division of responsibilities between the countries involved , which he said did not function properly .

us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense .

bundeswehr spokesman markus werther underscored that germany 's new role in the north sent a clear signal to the afghan government that nato would continue to support it . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de escalating violence puts german peacekeepers on edge the flare-up of violence in afghanistan comes at a bad time for german soldiers preparing to take over the international peacekeeping force isaf this week .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .
a democratic election brought militant group hamas to power in palestine .
and iran continues to resist appeals to cease its nuclear activities . as a result , the eighth annual german world bank forum , on thursday and friday , is bringing together representatives of the political , business and academic communities to refocus attention on ties between germany and the region and identify opportunities for enhanced political and economic cooperation . the forum , titled , " germany and the middle east : change and opportunities , " wo n't focus on the boycott of hamas or even iran 's nuclear activities .
instead , topping the agenda is how to increase technical , educational , political and especially economic cooperation and social contact . " the region has important business potential , particularly for germans , " said alexander neunzig of the hamburg chamber of commerce , a partner in the forum .
" and increased business relationships are a prerequisite for improved political ties , better economic development in the region and peace . " billions in trade german trade with the region amounts to billions annually .
with countries such as iran or saudi arabia , annual trade is 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- and 5.4 billion euros respectively , according to the hamburg chamber of commerce .
the main areas of trade are chemical and industrial products and machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president paul wolfowitz is expected to urge more german development help as a result , some fear that german business could suffer if political relations between arab nations and the west deteriorate .
germany , who opposed the iraq war , has been in the forefront regarding iran and palestine , leading some in the german business community to become nervous . " we need to examine where the middle east is heading , " said peter goepfrich , executive director of the german-arab chamber of commerce .
" we also need to take a look at the widening gap in relations .
on the one hand , there is an economic boom in the region ; on the other , there is an escalation of political tensions . " germany has a good reputation in the region , built over many years .
much of that is due to the prestige of its products as much as personal interaction and trust-building in business relationships .
this will help insulate german business from politics , experts say . " even if the political situation gets tenser , our business relationships are strong and much more stable and should be fine , " said neunzig .
" we even have businessmen coming from iran and iraq to the forum . " a slow renaissance there is also an increasing interest in germany in enhancing political ties since the september 11 attacks in new york . " a policy shift is too strong a description , " said katja niethammer , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" but the past social democratic-green party government gave a new accentuation to the region and germany became more visible . " the war in iraq and germany 's opposition to it also enhanced the country 's standing in the region , say experts .
although it has also led to some misunderstandings as arab countries expect germany to side with them against the us in other issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's standing in the arab world increased after it opposed the iraq war other forms of cooperation have been expanding in the past decade , such as efforts to promote good governance , rebuild infrastructure and in education .
a particular emphasis is on reaching young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . as a result , german-style universities have opened in syria , cairo and jordan in the past five years and one is planned for oman .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- are also expanding into the gulf region , with new branches in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates . " the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , " said germany 's ambassador to the uae , jürgen steltzer .
" before we were not too politically active , but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that also has to include the softer fields , such as cultural and educational exchanges .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .

" the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information .

her defense team had argued that she is mentally ill and should serve three and a half years in prison for manslaughter . father says he had no knowledge of births the accused gave birth to nine babies between 1988 and 1998 , all of whom were found dead .
she was charged with only eight counts of manslaughter however , because the death of the first baby fell under the statute of limitations stipulated by east german law . the unemployed dental hygienist , described by psychiatrists as sane and " extremely bright , " is believed to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception with her husband , who has said he was unaware of the pregnancies and has not been charged .
the defendant testified that as soon as the contractions began each time she went into labor , she drowned the pain in alcohol to the point that she passed out . each time she woke , she said , she would find the lifeless body of a baby buried in potting soil on the balcony of her apartment . pathologists were unable to say whether the children were born alive or to determine the cause of death because their remains were in an advanced state of decomposition when they were discovered .
they were , however , able to learn their sex - seven girls and two boys . hilschenz 's longtime husband and the father of all the children , who is believed to have worked for the despised east german secret police , the stasi , told prosecutors he had had no knowledge of the pregnancies , births or deaths .
he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.06.2006 another german state bans headscarf for teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the ban is unconstitutional germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , joins seven other states in forbidding teachers in public schools from wearing the muslim headscarf . the law banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves was adopted on wednesday by the regional parliament of the western state of north-rhine westphalia , where the conservative christian democrats hold a majority .
the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .

the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .
a democratic election brought militant group hamas to power in palestine .
and iran continues to resist appeals to cease its nuclear activities . as a result , the eighth annual german world bank forum , on thursday and friday , is bringing together representatives of the political , business and academic communities to refocus attention on ties between germany and the region and identify opportunities for enhanced political and economic cooperation . the forum , titled , " germany and the middle east : change and opportunities , " wo n't focus on the boycott of hamas or even iran 's nuclear activities .
instead , topping the agenda is how to increase technical , educational , political and especially economic cooperation and social contact . " the region has important business potential , particularly for germans , " said alexander neunzig of the hamburg chamber of commerce , a partner in the forum .
" and increased business relationships are a prerequisite for improved political ties , better economic development in the region and peace . " billions in trade german trade with the region amounts to billions annually .
with countries such as iran or saudi arabia , annual trade is 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- and 5.4 billion euros respectively , according to the hamburg chamber of commerce .
the main areas of trade are chemical and industrial products and machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president paul wolfowitz is expected to urge more german development help as a result , some fear that german business could suffer if political relations between arab nations and the west deteriorate .
germany , who opposed the iraq war , has been in the forefront regarding iran and palestine , leading some in the german business community to become nervous . " we need to examine where the middle east is heading , " said peter goepfrich , executive director of the german-arab chamber of commerce .
" we also need to take a look at the widening gap in relations .
on the one hand , there is an economic boom in the region ; on the other , there is an escalation of political tensions . " germany has a good reputation in the region , built over many years .
much of that is due to the prestige of its products as much as personal interaction and trust-building in business relationships .
this will help insulate german business from politics , experts say . " even if the political situation gets tenser , our business relationships are strong and much more stable and should be fine , " said neunzig .
" we even have businessmen coming from iran and iraq to the forum . " a slow renaissance there is also an increasing interest in germany in enhancing political ties since the september 11 attacks in new york . " a policy shift is too strong a description , " said katja niethammer , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" but the past social democratic-green party government gave a new accentuation to the region and germany became more visible . " the war in iraq and germany 's opposition to it also enhanced the country 's standing in the region , say experts .
although it has also led to some misunderstandings as arab countries expect germany to side with them against the us in other issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's standing in the arab world increased after it opposed the iraq war other forms of cooperation have been expanding in the past decade , such as efforts to promote good governance , rebuild infrastructure and in education .
a particular emphasis is on reaching young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . as a result , german-style universities have opened in syria , cairo and jordan in the past five years and one is planned for oman .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- are also expanding into the gulf region , with new branches in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates . " the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , " said germany 's ambassador to the uae , jürgen steltzer .
" before we were not too politically active , but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that also has to include the softer fields , such as cultural and educational exchanges . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's role in middle east waning as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .

but iran said thursday it wo n't accept . the european union hailed the unites states ' conditional offer to join direct talks on iran 's nuclear program , saying it strengthens their hand in negotiations with tehran . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , who along with his british and german counterparts has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to engage tehran , said the us policy shift " reinforces the credibility " of europe 's efforts . in berlin , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of the vienna talks thursday that washington 's offer was " a real strengthening of american efforts . " " i see a window opening " which could bring about a solution , steinmeier said , flanked by his dutch counterpart ben bot .
both ministers said they hoped iran would understand the significance of the offer and seize the opportunity . first us direct talks with iran in decades the us offer came on the eve of a meeting in the austrian capital of the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , russia , france , britain and china - plus germany .

" to underscore our commitment to a diplomatic solution and to enhance the prospects for success , as soon as iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities , the united states will come to the table with our eu-3 colleagues and meet with iran 's representatives , " she said . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said us participation " would be the strongest and most positive signal of our common wish to reach an agreement with iran . " " this important statement by the us administration reinforces our hope that out of the current discussions we will be able to establish a new and cooperative relationship with iran , based on mutual confidence , " he said . chance of tack one eu diplomat said the us change of tack could be decisive .

" it is a very important signal of the commitment of the us and their desire to see the negotiations succeed . " washington heavily backed the former iranian imperial regime of the shah , which was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an islamic republic headed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , visiting turkey wednesday , said , " we hope the way will be open to a political solution after the talks in vienna . " iranian reluctancce but iran on thursday rejected us conditions for talks , saying it was ready for negotiations but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . " we support dialogue in a fair and unbiased atmosphere , but we will not talk about our undeniable and legitimate rights , because this is the right of our people according to international laws and treaties , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters .
" we are ready to talk about common concerns and if the conditions are such in a way that we have outlined ... we are ready to negotiate with all parties .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information . " we are clearly in a rather embarrassing situation now , " the spokesman said .
" it is highly regrettable but it ca n't be changed . " bad timi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embarrassing report in may detailed how the agency spied on journalists or paid them to spy on others a new special parliamentary committee set up to examine the role and activities of the bnd as part of the war on terrorism is currently preparing to question al-masri and german officials over the matter .
the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .
the us also denies torturing suspects or handing them over to countries that do so . the admission also comes on the heel of a controversial report last week issued by parliamentary investigators that confirmed that the intelligence agency spied on german journalists until a few months ago and paid journalists to spy on their colleagues . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources .

over four years after deployment in the country , the bundeswehr faces a dangerous situation , said germany 's defense minister . four and a half years after being deployed in afghanistan , the german army or bundeswehr took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the northern half of the country on wednesday .
the new responsibility has come at a time when violence has risen in afghanistan , highlighted this week by unrest in kabul and the killing of aid workers in the north . german defense minister franz josef jung described the situation as dangerous for german troops who will be stationed in the city of mazar-i-sharif , in the new area of assignment .
the possibility of isolated ambushes by taliban militia was real , he said . " that is what worries us the most at the moment , " jung told german public television ard on wednesday . some critical of division of duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy plantations , from which heroin is produced , are numerous in the north currently 2,850 german soldiers are part of the nato-led isaf mission .
by the end of the year , 1,700 of them will be stationed in mazar-i-sharif .
although northern afghanistan is quieter than the east and the south , german brigadier general markus kneip described the situation there as " not calm and unstable . " the head of germany 's armed forces association , bernhard gertz , expressed his doubts about the overall order of the international peace mission .
in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung , he said germany 's mission was n't based on a " sound concept . "
gertz was also critical of the division of responsibilities between the countries involved , which he said did not function properly .
thirty-nine nations in have troops in afghanistan . without any adjustments in these areas , the goal to improve the lives of the afghans would not be achieved , gertz said . violent week , violent summer ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an action aid sign lies in the vehicle after three of its workers were killed the new bundeswehr assignment in the north comes on the heels of a bloody week that saw close to 20 people killed in violence in the capital , kabul .
in the north , the area where german forces have taken over security operations , three international aid workers and their afghan driver were shot dead by supposed taliban rebels . us commanders in afghanistan admitted on wednesday that american soldiers might have shot at unarmed civilians in kabul who had been outraged by the killing of five people when a us military truck rammed into civilian cars on monday .
us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense . " the us ambassador to afghanistan , ronald neumann , told the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung that following the recent unrest in afghanistan , a " bloody summer " was to be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a must if peace is to be achieved in afghanistan " the taliban think that the nato countries are weak and that the europeans will run away if they strike hard now , " he said . neumann complimented the german forces for their engagement thus far , but he warned that the relatively safe north could expect conditions like that in the rest of the country this summer . nato has said that despite the current instability in afghanistan , operations there should be extended to the whole country .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 .

" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information .

the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .
he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .
the army was not prepared for africa , and there were worries about the high aids rate and the climate , he said . troops will help stabilize country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have already been deployed to dr congo politicians from both ruling parties have rejected the criticism .
social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .
" all things considered , we say that it 's right to send german soldiers to dr congo , " greens parliamentary chief fritz kuhn said .
only then would the congolese be able to improve their lives . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .

her defense team had argued that she is mentally ill and should serve three and a half years in prison for manslaughter . father says he had no knowledge of births the accused gave birth to nine babies between 1988 and 1998 , all of whom were found dead .
she was charged with only eight counts of manslaughter however , because the death of the first baby fell under the statute of limitations stipulated by east german law . the unemployed dental hygienist , described by psychiatrists as sane and " extremely bright , " is believed to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception with her husband , who has said he was unaware of the pregnancies and has not been charged .
the defendant testified that as soon as the contractions began each time she went into labor , she drowned the pain in alcohol to the point that she passed out . each time she woke , she said , she would find the lifeless body of a baby buried in potting soil on the balcony of her apartment . pathologists were unable to say whether the children were born alive or to determine the cause of death because their remains were in an advanced state of decomposition when they were discovered .
they were , however , able to learn their sex - seven girls and two boys . hilschenz 's longtime husband and the father of all the children , who is believed to have worked for the despised east german secret police , the stasi , told prosecutors he had had no knowledge of the pregnancies , births or deaths .
he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .
she then became pregnant by her new boyfriend and carried the child to term . she is now believed to be suffering from cancer and is reportedly scheduled to undergo an operation after the verdict is read . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german woman on trial for baby killings a german woman went on trial for manslaughter in the eastern city of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday after the bodies of nine of her newborn babies were found hidden in her parents ' garden .

" there is no-one better for this job than sepp blatter , " beckenbauer said in an interview with der tagesspiegel newspaper .
" he can talk with anyone .
i can only speak german and a little english .
blatter can speak italian , french , spanish and portuguese and that is a big advantage . " " fifa is blatter 's life .
that is his family .
he does n't have young children like me .
he has no other family . " beckenbauer , 60 , who won world cups with germany as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990 , won admirers for spearheading the bid to win germany the right to host this year 's tournament which kicks off on june 9 . former swiss lawyer blatter , 70 , announced in march that he would stand for a third term in office in next year 's election .
he succeeded the brazilian joao havelange at the head of fifa in 1998 and won re-election in a landslide victory over the cameroonian candidate issa hayatou on the eve of the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan . blatter fought off wide-ranging accusations of financial irregularities and vote-buying to secure his second term in office . dw-world.de beckenbauer : from kaiser to president ?
germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .

her defense team had argued that she is mentally ill and should serve three and a half years in prison for manslaughter . father says he had no knowledge of births the accused gave birth to nine babies between 1988 and 1998 , all of whom were found dead .
she was charged with only eight counts of manslaughter however , because the death of the first baby fell under the statute of limitations stipulated by east german law . the unemployed dental hygienist , described by psychiatrists as sane and " extremely bright , " is believed to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception with her husband , who has said he was unaware of the pregnancies and has not been charged .
the defendant testified that as soon as the contractions began each time she went into labor , she drowned the pain in alcohol to the point that she passed out . each time she woke , she said , she would find the lifeless body of a baby buried in potting soil on the balcony of her apartment . pathologists were unable to say whether the children were born alive or to determine the cause of death because their remains were in an advanced state of decomposition when they were discovered .
they were , however , able to learn their sex - seven girls and two boys . hilschenz 's longtime husband and the father of all the children , who is believed to have worked for the despised east german secret police , the stasi , told prosecutors he had had no knowledge of the pregnancies , births or deaths .
he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .

us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense . " the us ambassador to afghanistan , ronald neumann , told the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung that following the recent unrest in afghanistan , a " bloody summer " was to be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a must if peace is to be achieved in afghanistan " the taliban think that the nato countries are weak and that the europeans will run away if they strike hard now , " he said . neumann complimented the german forces for their engagement thus far , but he warned that the relatively safe north could expect conditions like that in the rest of the country this summer . nato has said that despite the current instability in afghanistan , operations there should be extended to the whole country .
bundeswehr spokesman markus werther underscored that germany 's new role in the north sent a clear signal to the afghan government that nato would continue to support it . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de escalating violence puts german peacekeepers on edge the flare-up of violence in afghanistan comes at a bad time for german soldiers preparing to take over the international peacekeeping force isaf this week .

she was charged with only eight counts of manslaughter however , because the death of the first baby fell under the statute of limitations stipulated by east german law . the unemployed dental hygienist , described by psychiatrists as sane and " extremely bright , " is believed to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception with her husband , who has said he was unaware of the pregnancies and has not been charged .
the defendant testified that as soon as the contractions began each time she went into labor , she drowned the pain in alcohol to the point that she passed out . each time she woke , she said , she would find the lifeless body of a baby buried in potting soil on the balcony of her apartment . pathologists were unable to say whether the children were born alive or to determine the cause of death because their remains were in an advanced state of decomposition when they were discovered .
they were , however , able to learn their sex - seven girls and two boys . hilschenz 's longtime husband and the father of all the children , who is believed to have worked for the despised east german secret police , the stasi , told prosecutors he had had no knowledge of the pregnancies , births or deaths .
he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .

some ticketless fans got lucky by going directly to the venues . it was meant as a secondary measure .
the world cup organizing committee opened ticket centers this week so that soccer fans who managed to get tickets to the event in the past few weeks or days could pick them up personally , instead of anxiously waiting for them in the mail , uncertain if they would arrive on time . whether it was the term " ticket center or just a last-gasp attempt , on tuesday , fans stormed the outlet in gelsenkirchen , the first of its kind to open - and were rewarded handsomely . carsten eggert , from münster , and a friend drove to gelsenkirchen more on a whim than anything else .
when the day was over , they returned home with the coveted entry passes , including one for the germany-ecuador match . " i did n't think i would get a ticket period .

" " this important statement by the us administration reinforces our hope that out of the current discussions we will be able to establish a new and cooperative relationship with iran , based on mutual confidence , " he said . chance of tack one eu diplomat said the us change of tack could be decisive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says that giving up its nuclear activities is not a possibility " when you add the us to direct negotiations , a country which has not had direct relations with iran since the arrival of khomeini ... the value of the negotiations changes substantially , " he said .
" it is a very important signal of the commitment of the us and their desire to see the negotiations succeed . " washington heavily backed the former iranian imperial regime of the shah , which was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an islamic republic headed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , visiting turkey wednesday , said , " we hope the way will be open to a political solution after the talks in vienna . " iranian reluctancce but iran on thursday rejected us conditions for talks , saying it was ready for negotiations but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . " we support dialogue in a fair and unbiased atmosphere , but we will not talk about our undeniable and legitimate rights , because this is the right of our people according to international laws and treaties , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters .
" we are ready to talk about common concerns and if the conditions are such in a way that we have outlined ... we are ready to negotiate with all parties . " mottaki said that rice 's statement - which also touched on us concerns over iran 's human rights record and its alleged support for terrorism - " did not have any new words in it . " " they have repeated their old words .
a new solution and a logical solution for the nuclear issue was not seen in the declaration , " said mottaki , giving the islamic republic 's first reaction to the us proposal .
" maybe they wanted to cover up their crimes in the region .
first and foremost , the us should be held accountable for their crimes in iraq , afghanistan , the prisons of guantanamo and -lrb- baghdad 's -rrb- abu ghraib -lrb- jail -rrb- .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .

there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .

baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .

her defense team had argued that she is mentally ill and should serve three and a half years in prison for manslaughter . father says he had no knowledge of births the accused gave birth to nine babies between 1988 and 1998 , all of whom were found dead .
she was charged with only eight counts of manslaughter however , because the death of the first baby fell under the statute of limitations stipulated by east german law . the unemployed dental hygienist , described by psychiatrists as sane and " extremely bright , " is believed to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception with her husband , who has said he was unaware of the pregnancies and has not been charged .
the defendant testified that as soon as the contractions began each time she went into labor , she drowned the pain in alcohol to the point that she passed out . each time she woke , she said , she would find the lifeless body of a baby buried in potting soil on the balcony of her apartment . pathologists were unable to say whether the children were born alive or to determine the cause of death because their remains were in an advanced state of decomposition when they were discovered .
they were , however , able to learn their sex - seven girls and two boys . hilschenz 's longtime husband and the father of all the children , who is believed to have worked for the despised east german secret police , the stasi , told prosecutors he had had no knowledge of the pregnancies , births or deaths .
he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .
she then became pregnant by her new boyfriend and carried the child to term . she is now believed to be suffering from cancer and is reportedly scheduled to undergo an operation after the verdict is read . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german woman on trial for baby killings a german woman went on trial for manslaughter in the eastern city of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday after the bodies of nine of her newborn babies were found hidden in her parents ' garden .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .
he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .

social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .
a democratic election brought militant group hamas to power in palestine .
and iran continues to resist appeals to cease its nuclear activities . as a result , the eighth annual german world bank forum , on thursday and friday , is bringing together representatives of the political , business and academic communities to refocus attention on ties between germany and the region and identify opportunities for enhanced political and economic cooperation . the forum , titled , " germany and the middle east : change and opportunities , " wo n't focus on the boycott of hamas or even iran 's nuclear activities .
instead , topping the agenda is how to increase technical , educational , political and especially economic cooperation and social contact . " the region has important business potential , particularly for germans , " said alexander neunzig of the hamburg chamber of commerce , a partner in the forum .
" and increased business relationships are a prerequisite for improved political ties , better economic development in the region and peace . " billions in trade german trade with the region amounts to billions annually .
with countries such as iran or saudi arabia , annual trade is 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- and 5.4 billion euros respectively , according to the hamburg chamber of commerce .
the main areas of trade are chemical and industrial products and machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president paul wolfowitz is expected to urge more german development help as a result , some fear that german business could suffer if political relations between arab nations and the west deteriorate .
germany , who opposed the iraq war , has been in the forefront regarding iran and palestine , leading some in the german business community to become nervous . " we need to examine where the middle east is heading , " said peter goepfrich , executive director of the german-arab chamber of commerce .
" we also need to take a look at the widening gap in relations .
on the one hand , there is an economic boom in the region ; on the other , there is an escalation of political tensions . " germany has a good reputation in the region , built over many years .
much of that is due to the prestige of its products as much as personal interaction and trust-building in business relationships .
this will help insulate german business from politics , experts say . " even if the political situation gets tenser , our business relationships are strong and much more stable and should be fine , " said neunzig .
" we even have businessmen coming from iran and iraq to the forum . " a slow renaissance there is also an increasing interest in germany in enhancing political ties since the september 11 attacks in new york . " a policy shift is too strong a description , " said katja niethammer , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" but the past social democratic-green party government gave a new accentuation to the region and germany became more visible . " the war in iraq and germany 's opposition to it also enhanced the country 's standing in the region , say experts .
although it has also led to some misunderstandings as arab countries expect germany to side with them against the us in other issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's standing in the arab world increased after it opposed the iraq war other forms of cooperation have been expanding in the past decade , such as efforts to promote good governance , rebuild infrastructure and in education .
a particular emphasis is on reaching young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . as a result , german-style universities have opened in syria , cairo and jordan in the past five years and one is planned for oman .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- are also expanding into the gulf region , with new branches in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates . " the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , " said germany 's ambassador to the uae , jürgen steltzer .
" before we were not too politically active , but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that also has to include the softer fields , such as cultural and educational exchanges .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information . " we are clearly in a rather embarrassing situation now , " the spokesman said .
" it is highly regrettable but it ca n't be changed . " bad timi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embarrassing report in may detailed how the agency spied on journalists or paid them to spy on others a new special parliamentary committee set up to examine the role and activities of the bnd as part of the war on terrorism is currently preparing to question al-masri and german officials over the matter .
the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .
the us also denies torturing suspects or handing them over to countries that do so . the admission also comes on the heel of a controversial report last week issued by parliamentary investigators that confirmed that the intelligence agency spied on german journalists until a few months ago and paid journalists to spy on their colleagues . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information .

the war in iraq is still raging .
fury over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to rioting and boycotts of western products .
a democratic election brought militant group hamas to power in palestine .
and iran continues to resist appeals to cease its nuclear activities . as a result , the eighth annual german world bank forum , on thursday and friday , is bringing together representatives of the political , business and academic communities to refocus attention on ties between germany and the region and identify opportunities for enhanced political and economic cooperation . the forum , titled , " germany and the middle east : change and opportunities , " wo n't focus on the boycott of hamas or even iran 's nuclear activities .
instead , topping the agenda is how to increase technical , educational , political and especially economic cooperation and social contact . " the region has important business potential , particularly for germans , " said alexander neunzig of the hamburg chamber of commerce , a partner in the forum .
" and increased business relationships are a prerequisite for improved political ties , better economic development in the region and peace . " billions in trade german trade with the region amounts to billions annually .
with countries such as iran or saudi arabia , annual trade is 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- and 5.4 billion euros respectively , according to the hamburg chamber of commerce .
the main areas of trade are chemical and industrial products and machinery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president paul wolfowitz is expected to urge more german development help as a result , some fear that german business could suffer if political relations between arab nations and the west deteriorate .
germany , who opposed the iraq war , has been in the forefront regarding iran and palestine , leading some in the german business community to become nervous . " we need to examine where the middle east is heading , " said peter goepfrich , executive director of the german-arab chamber of commerce .
" we also need to take a look at the widening gap in relations .
on the one hand , there is an economic boom in the region ; on the other , there is an escalation of political tensions . " germany has a good reputation in the region , built over many years .
much of that is due to the prestige of its products as much as personal interaction and trust-building in business relationships .
this will help insulate german business from politics , experts say . " even if the political situation gets tenser , our business relationships are strong and much more stable and should be fine , " said neunzig .
" we even have businessmen coming from iran and iraq to the forum . " a slow renaissance there is also an increasing interest in germany in enhancing political ties since the september 11 attacks in new york . " a policy shift is too strong a description , " said katja niethammer , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" but the past social democratic-green party government gave a new accentuation to the region and germany became more visible . " the war in iraq and germany 's opposition to it also enhanced the country 's standing in the region , say experts .
although it has also led to some misunderstandings as arab countries expect germany to side with them against the us in other issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's standing in the arab world increased after it opposed the iraq war other forms of cooperation have been expanding in the past decade , such as efforts to promote good governance , rebuild infrastructure and in education .
a particular emphasis is on reaching young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . as a result , german-style universities have opened in syria , cairo and jordan in the past five years and one is planned for oman .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- are also expanding into the gulf region , with new branches in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates . " the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , " said germany 's ambassador to the uae , jürgen steltzer .
" before we were not too politically active , but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that also has to include the softer fields , such as cultural and educational exchanges .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .

there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .

her defense team had argued that she is mentally ill and should serve three and a half years in prison for manslaughter . father says he had no knowledge of births the accused gave birth to nine babies between 1988 and 1998 , all of whom were found dead .

he and the couple 's three grown children declined to testify . neighbors , friends and relatives made the same claim , saying her heavy-set build and loose-fitting clothing apparently allowed her to hide the fact she was pregnant . politically sensitive affair brandenburg 's interior minister , jörg schönbohm infuriated easterners when he said that the " forced proletarization " of certain regions under east germany 's communist leaders had created a culture of apathy that fostered such crimes . the remarks are believed to have cost angela merkel 's christian democrats key votes in the east in the september general election , although she is now chancellor . hilschenz and her husband divorced last year .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .
he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .
the army was not prepared for africa , and there were worries about the high aids rate and the climate , he said . troops will help stabilize country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have already been deployed to dr congo politicians from both ruling parties have rejected the criticism .
social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .
" all things considered , we say that it 's right to send german soldiers to dr congo , " greens parliamentary chief fritz kuhn said .
only then would the congolese be able to improve their lives . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .
still , in some states such as berlin , the wearing of headscarves by muslims is banned for all civil servants . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school suspends burka-clad students a high school in the german city of bonn has suspended two muslim girls for wearing a burka , an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central and south asia .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .
but germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled soon after that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
it did say , however , that germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin of afghani origin brought the first case in 2003 to keep her job in baden-württemberg expelled from the workplace muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
muslims makes up germany 's third largest religious community , after protestants and catholics .
the german state laws tend to stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students .

both ministers said they hoped iran would understand the significance of the offer and seize the opportunity . first us direct talks with iran in decades the us offer came on the eve of a meeting in the austrian capital of the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , russia , france , britain and china - plus germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful specifically , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington is ready to join direct talks with europe on iran 's nuclear program if tehran suspends all uranium enrichment activities . she made the offer of the first substantive talks with iran since diplomatic ties were broken off 26 years ago as she prepared to leave for the crucial meeting of world powers in vienna on tehran 's suspected nuclear arms program . " to underscore our commitment to a diplomatic solution and to enhance the prospects for success , as soon as iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities , the united states will come to the table with our eu-3 colleagues and meet with iran 's representatives , " she said . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said us participation " would be the strongest and most positive signal of our common wish to reach an agreement with iran . " " this important statement by the us administration reinforces our hope that out of the current discussions we will be able to establish a new and cooperative relationship with iran , based on mutual confidence , " he said . chance of tack one eu diplomat said the us change of tack could be decisive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says that giving up its nuclear activities is not a possibility " when you add the us to direct negotiations , a country which has not had direct relations with iran since the arrival of khomeini ... the value of the negotiations changes substantially , " he said .
" it is a very important signal of the commitment of the us and their desire to see the negotiations succeed . " washington heavily backed the former iranian imperial regime of the shah , which was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an islamic republic headed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , visiting turkey wednesday , said , " we hope the way will be open to a political solution after the talks in vienna . " iranian reluctancce but iran on thursday rejected us conditions for talks , saying it was ready for negotiations but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . " we support dialogue in a fair and unbiased atmosphere , but we will not talk about our undeniable and legitimate rights , because this is the right of our people according to international laws and treaties , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told reporters .
" we are ready to talk about common concerns and if the conditions are such in a way that we have outlined ... we are ready to negotiate with all parties . " mottaki said that rice 's statement - which also touched on us concerns over iran 's human rights record and its alleged support for terrorism - " did not have any new words in it . " " they have repeated their old words .
a new solution and a logical solution for the nuclear issue was not seen in the declaration , " said mottaki , giving the islamic republic 's first reaction to the us proposal .
" maybe they wanted to cover up their crimes in the region .
first and foremost , the us should be held accountable for their crimes in iraq , afghanistan , the prisons of guantanamo and -lrb- baghdad 's -rrb- abu ghraib -lrb- jail -rrb- .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .
their primary task , should it be necessary , would be to help in evacuations from dr congo 's capital kinshasa . the last time the bundeswehr had ground soldiers on the african continent was in 1993-1994 as part of a un mission in somalia . mission purpose unclear to some politicians , soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's first african mission in 12 years despite clear support from christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- lawmakers , the assignment has not received whole-hearted backing .
parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .
" the government 's application has been prepared in an amateur fashion and is not coherent , " hoyer said .
neither the bundeswehr nor the germans in general were in favor of sending troops to congo , he alleged . the left party 's wolfgang gehrcke also doubted the necessity of the mission .
" we think this mission is wrong , as contradictory and not the right way to stablize dr congo , " gehrcke said .
he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .
the army was not prepared for africa , and there were worries about the high aids rate and the climate , he said . troops will help stabilize country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have already been deployed to dr congo politicians from both ruling parties have rejected the criticism .
social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .
" all things considered , we say that it 's right to send german soldiers to dr congo , " greens parliamentary chief fritz kuhn said .
only then would the congolese be able to improve their lives . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .

it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years . germany approved the deployment of 780 soldiers to the democratic republic of congo to support a european peacekeeping mission during elections in that country this summer .
five-hundred soldiers will be part of an eu force and 280 will assist in medical and logistical tasks . the command of the mission , which will consist of 2,000 eu soldiers in total , will be directed from headquarters in potsdam by german major general karlheinz viereck .
france will supply the largest contingent with 800 troops , and a french general , under viereck 's command , will lead the troops . the length of the assignment is set at four months and will start on july 30 , the day the poll will be held .
german troops will be stationed in neighboring gabon .

parliamentarians from the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party voted against the measure . the fdp 's expert for foreign affairs , werner hoyer , said that the coalition did not convince his party the mission would be effective .

he demanded that the 56 million euros that the mission is expected to cost be used for construction projects in dr congo . reinhold robbe , the army 's parliamentary liaison , told german ard public television that the decision had met with outright rejection amongst soldiers .

social democratic party defense expert walter kolbow said there was nothing more important than the promotion of democracy in dr congo . " germany has a security interest in a successful stabilization in congo , " he said .
" we have to tackle the problems there before the problems come to us . " only after the democratic election of a president and a national assembly , which would be the first time in 40 years , could the war for the country 's vast natural resources come to an end , he said . christian democrat eckart von klaeden pointed out that it was not the eu force 's responsibility to stabilize dr congo , but that of the 17,000 un forces already present in the central african country .
they had done a surprisingly good job so far , he said .
the eu troops would stay in dr congo for only a limited amount of time . a majority of the opposition green party voted for the measure but expressed skepticism about preparations for the mission so far .

al-masri claims he was abducted by us agents and held and tortured for months in an afghani jail before being released and flown to albania .
he filed an unsuccessful legal suit in the us and is also seeking compensation from germany . prosecutors are currently investigating al-masri 's charges .
chancellor angela merkel 's office said in a statement it " regretted " the information had not been divulged before .
they added they would brief munich prosecutors . a leak i n macedo n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he says he was kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan the bnd told officials that an employee in macedonia first heard about al-masri during a conversation in a restaurant of a security agency there in january 2004 . " a person he did not know casually told him that a german citizen called al-masri had been arrested at skopje airport because he was on a wanted list , " the agency said through a statement .
" the person told him that al-masri had been handed over to the americans . " the agency also said it was looking into the matter : " this information breakdown within the service is being thoroughly worked through with all those involved in order to prevent any repetition , " the statement said . a spokesman for the agency told dpa news service that the man was a low-ranking official , who had not realized the significance of the information .

the committee is also looking into how agents cooperated with the united states , particularly at the start of the iraq war in 2003 . human rights groups and many european politicians have criticized such abductions , called " secret rendition " transfers which they say are illegal and promote torture because suspects are often transferred to countries known to practice torture . us officials have admitted conducting such transfers but say there are far fewer than alleged .
the us also denies torturing suspects or handing them over to countries that do so . the admission also comes on the heel of a controversial report last week issued by parliamentary investigators that confirmed that the intelligence agency spied on german journalists until a few months ago and paid journalists to spy on their colleagues . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.06.2006 another german state bans headscarf for teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the ban is unconstitutional germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , joins seven other states in forbidding teachers in public schools from wearing the muslim headscarf . the law banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves was adopted on wednesday by the regional parliament of the western state of north-rhine westphalia , where the conservative christian democrats hold a majority .
the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
biggest turkish community outside turkey the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has increased its integration efforts regarding immigrants but grapples with sensitive issues such as headscarves amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
there was a heated debate in germany , the home to the world 's biggest turkish community outside turkey , about whether headscarves should be banned in schools in 2003 , when such a law was proposed in france .
it was adopted by the french parliament in 2004 .
baden-württemberg was the first german state to take action , passing a law in 2003 forbidding teachers to wear the attire .

the social democrats and the greens voted against it .
that means that muslim teachers in half of all german states are forbidden to wear headscarves .
with the exception of berlin , those states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , bremen , hesse , lower saxony and saarland - are all in the western part of germany , and the majority of the country 's 8 million turks live there and in the capital .
the central council of muslims in germany , which represents 3 million muslims , called the new law unconstitutional because it does not treat all religions as equal , banning only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols .
they argue that the measure practically bans muslim women who wear traditional headscarves from working as teachers .
furthermore , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .

over four years after deployment in the country , the bundeswehr faces a dangerous situation , said germany 's defense minister . four and a half years after being deployed in afghanistan , the german army or bundeswehr took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the northern half of the country on wednesday .
the new responsibility has come at a time when violence has risen in afghanistan , highlighted this week by unrest in kabul and the killing of aid workers in the north . german defense minister franz josef jung described the situation as dangerous for german troops who will be stationed in the city of mazar-i-sharif , in the new area of assignment .
the possibility of isolated ambushes by taliban militia was real , he said . " that is what worries us the most at the moment , " jung told german public television ard on wednesday . some critical of division of duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy plantations , from which heroin is produced , are numerous in the north currently 2,850 german soldiers are part of the nato-led isaf mission .
by the end of the year , 1,700 of them will be stationed in mazar-i-sharif .
although northern afghanistan is quieter than the east and the south , german brigadier general markus kneip described the situation there as " not calm and unstable . " the head of germany 's armed forces association , bernhard gertz , expressed his doubts about the overall order of the international peace mission .
in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung , he said germany 's mission was n't based on a " sound concept . "
gertz was also critical of the division of responsibilities between the countries involved , which he said did not function properly .

in the north , the area where german forces have taken over security operations , three international aid workers and their afghan driver were shot dead by supposed taliban rebels . us commanders in afghanistan admitted on wednesday that american soldiers might have shot at unarmed civilians in kabul who had been outraged by the killing of five people when a us military truck rammed into civilian cars on monday .
us colonel tom collins said there were signs that american soldiers used their weapons " in self-defense . " the us ambassador to afghanistan , ronald neumann , told the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung that following the recent unrest in afghanistan , a " bloody summer " was to be expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a must if peace is to be achieved in afghanistan " the taliban think that the nato countries are weak and that the europeans will run away if they strike hard now , " he said . neumann complimented the german forces for their engagement thus far , but he warned that the relatively safe north could expect conditions like that in the rest of the country this summer . nato has said that despite the current instability in afghanistan , operations there should be extended to the whole country .
bundeswehr spokesman markus werther underscored that germany 's new role in the north sent a clear signal to the afghan government that nato would continue to support it . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : escalating violence puts german peacekeepers on edge the flare-up of violence in afghanistan comes at a bad time for german soldiers preparing to take over the international peacekeeping force isaf this week .

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news the first in a new wave of deals to allow private firms to run gp services was signed last week .
ministers want to encourage private sector involvement in primary care to fill gaps in areas which have traditionally struggled to attract doctors .
what does the future hold ?
the government wants to see a range of gp providers derbyshire gp elizabeth barrett thought she had put together the ideal bid .
she had worked as a family doctor in the county for 20 years .
and as one of the partners at a nearby practice in the north east of the county , she thought she was perfectly positioned to run one of the creswell primary care centre practices .
she proposed running the surgery along with a multi-disciplinary team involving nurses and a pharmacist - just the sort of model of care the government was calling for .
but a few days before christmas she was told by local health bosses she had not won the contract .
instead , it was offered to united health europe , part of a major us health firm .
" the whole process was mysterious , " dr garrett said .
" it was very hard to know what was happening with the bid and looking back i feel i never had a chance against such a big company .
pen-to-paper " my fear now is that other gps will struggle to win contracts because these big firms want to get involved .
that will be a shame .
" firms have to make profits for their shareholders and that leads to care being compromised , whereas gps have been trained and worked for the nhs all their lives , the ethos is different . "
united health europe was set to become the first private firm to be chosen to run gp services following the decision by ministers last year to fully open the market to private companies .
but the contract has not been finalised because a legal challenge by a local resident has meant the case is subject to a judicial review in the high court .
instead , it was left to east london health chiefs to become the first to put pen-to-paper in an expected new wave of deals .
the danger is that once these firms are in place they will destabilise the local gp network paul evans , of keep our nhs public barking and dagenham primary care trust signed a £ 5m deal with care uk , which runs a host of care homes and private hospitals , to provide gp services for over 7,000 patients .
the deal was brokered by the government as part of a bid to get gps into under-doctored areas .
a handful of other contracts are also up for grabs in other parts of the country , including liverpool and london .
to date , most private involvement in the nhs has been confined to providing non-emergency surgery .
there is some private involvement in gp care .
but this has been limited to organisations such as chilvers mccrea , a company established four years ago by an nhs nurse and a gp which is now running more than 20 practices across the country .
several other partnership arrangements have followed in their wake , but many see them as a different breed to the big firms as they are run by former nhs staff and remain essentially niche organisations specialising in primary care .
but with other contracts in the pipeline , doctors and campaigners fear the private sector is gearing up to monopolise the market .
flexible gps , nurses and voluntary organisations are free to bid for the contracts under the new flexible arrangements .
but the british medical association remains concerned nhs professionals are not competing on a level playing field .
dr richard vautrey , of the bma 's gps committee , said : " these multinationals have huge resources , it is hard for doctors to compete if they want to bid .
" what i want to see is primary care trusts giving doctors and other nhs staff support and training in how to bid for the contracts " .
this new competition can only be good news for nhs patients as it will deliver a wider range of services open at more convenient times lord warner , health minister paul evans , of campaign group keep our nhs public , is also concerned .
" the danger is that once these firms are in place , they will destabilise the local gp network .
" they may well compete for patients and discriminate against the ones with the most complex needs .
that is not the way we want care to go . "
" in years to come , we could see a handful of big firms controlling the market just as has happened with the care home market . "
many private firms sniffing around the gp market have been hesitant to declare their intentions .
however , it seems clear the money and opportunities involved have certainly sparked some interest .
geoff benn , group marketing director at care uk , admitted the private sector would be bidding for more deals .
but he added : " to say it will be the privatisation of the nhs is a little ill-founded .
i think there is scope for firms and current nhs doctors to work together .
" and i think private firms will bring something different to the market .
" i imagine we will see them diversify into different services , such as minor surgery , and filling gaps between the traditional gp service and hospital . "
for the government , the concept of encouraging businesses to bid for contracts is not just driven by the desire to provide extra services .
health minister lord warner said many of the most deprived areas of the country had been " under-served for too long " .
he said : " this new competition can only be good news for nhs patients as it will deliver a wider range of services open at more convenient times . "

" what i want to see is primary care trusts giving doctors and other nhs staff support and training in how to bid for the contracts " .
this new competition can only be good news for nhs patients as it will deliver a wider range of services open at more convenient times lord warner , health minister paul evans , of campaign group keep our nhs public , is also concerned .
" the danger is that once these firms are in place , they will destabilise the local gp network .
" they may well compete for patients and discriminate against the ones with the most complex needs .
that is not the way we want care to go . "
" in years to come , we could see a handful of big firms controlling the market just as has happened with the care home market . "
many private firms sniffing around the gp market have been hesitant to declare their intentions .
however , it seems clear the money and opportunities involved have certainly sparked some interest .
geoff benn , group marketing director at care uk , admitted the private sector would be bidding for more deals .
but he added : " to say it will be the privatisation of the nhs is a little ill-founded .
i think there is scope for firms and current nhs doctors to work together .
" and i think private firms will bring something different to the market .
" i imagine we will see them diversify into different services , such as minor surgery , and filling gaps between the traditional gp service and hospital . "
for the government , the concept of encouraging businesses to bid for contracts is not just driven by the desire to provide extra services .
health minister lord warner said many of the most deprived areas of the country had been " under-served for too long " .
he said : " this new competition can only be good news for nhs patients as it will deliver a wider range of services open at more convenient times . "

chung dong-young said he was taking all responsibility for the results , which saw uri win just one of 16 key regional posts at stake .
the main opposition grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- took 12 twelve posts , including the capital , seoul .
the poll could have far reaching consequences for the south 's ties with north korea , correspondents say .
" i failed to keep my promise , " mr chung was quoted as saying by uri party officials .
" the responsibility for the election defeat lies on the party chairman , " he added .
the gnp secured 12 key posts in wednesday 's elections , the electoral commission said .
the smaller millennium democratic party won two races and one post went to an independent candidate .
the results of the poll are not surprising as uri had openly predicted disaster , saying it had failed to read the minds of the people , correspondents say .
the gnp has also gained public sympathy as a result of a knife attack by an unemployed ex-prisoner on party leader park geun-hye during election campaigning 10 days ago .

roh under fire the vote was also seen as a key test for the government of president roh moo-hyun , increasingly unpopular as it approaches its final year in office .
mr roh 's government is accused by its opponents of being incompetent and divisive in its running of the economy and in foreign affairs .
the government has irritated the us with what is seen as an indulgent policy towards north korea , despite the north 's claim to be developing nuclear weapons .
a big win for the opposition strengthens its position in the run-up to presidential elections next year .
it may also boost the chances of ms park , daughter of former military president park chung-hee , of winning the presidency .
president roh is prevented by law from seeking re-election .
the gnp has been pushing for a tougher line on aid to the north and for improved relations with the us .
north korea has warned about a rise in what it sees as hostile political forces in the south .

he said he was handing control of the cabinet to the prime minister and would take no part in political campaigning .
but mr chen 's spokesman said he would remain in charge of foreign and defence policy , and oversee ties with china .
mr chen 's announcement comes a week after his son-in-law was detained on suspicion of illegal share trading .
the case against chao chien-ming had prompted calls by opposition politicians for the president to resign .
chen shui-bian born in taiwan first president from dpp , after 50 years of kmt rule charismatic speaker with populist touch despised by china , which fears he wants formal independence profile : chen shui-bian taiwan flashpoint ma ying-jeou , leader of the opposition nationalist -lrb- kmt -rrb- party , said mr chen 's ceding of some powers was not enough .
" if he could not win people 's hearts , what is the point of continuing his presidency ? " he said .
the opposition has been trying to muster enough votes in the legislature to recall mr chen - the first step towards forcing him from office - but is about 30 seats short of the two-thirds majority needed in the 225-seat chamber .
members of mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- had also called on him to give up some powers , fearing he had become an electoral liability .
' ignominious retreat ' according to a written statement , mr chen handed the day-to-day running of the island to prime minister su tseng-chang , and gave him the powers to name the cabinet .
mr chen said he would no longer intervene in the running of the governing dpp .
the president also promised that his family would not engage in public functions other than charity events .
chao chien-ming has denied the allegations it is an ignominious retreat for a man who has built his political career on cleaning up taiwan 's notoriously corrupt politics , the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes reports .
mr chen 's move comes as his personal popularity hit an all-time low , and follows the dpp 's heavy defeat in recent local elections .
with two years to go before he must step down as president , critics say that giving up his day-to-day powers risks leaving him a lame duck .
but others say that he has kept control over the most important portfolio , taiwan 's troubled relations with china .
mr chen has infuriated china , which accuses him of wanting the island 's independence .
china sees taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if it ever moved to declare formal independence .
mr chen 's son-in-law , chao chien-ming , was detained last week amid allegations he used insider information when buying shares in a property company .
mr chao denied the allegations .
but they have been particularly damaging for mr chen , as they followed separate allegations involving his advisers , and his wife .

serkis is no stranger to the digital arts , having starred as gollum in the lord of the rings films and as the giant ape king kong .
he is now working on appearing in one of the leading titles for the ps3 , heavenly sword , starring in it as the evil king and acting as its dramatic director .
the game is a martial arts epic developed by uk game makers ninja theory for sony 's next generation console .
film qualities serkis became involved by chance .
his mortgage advisor is the brother of the boss of ninja theory , tameem antoniades .
we 've done facial tests with him to find out how to create believable performances in real time on the playstation 3 tameem antoniades , ninja theory when antoniades found out about his brother 's celebrity client , he asked him to pass on a trailer for the game .
once serkis saw it , he wanted in .
" we are aiming to bring the highest level of layered , truthful and emotionally engaging performance into heavenly sword , " said the actor .
the game aims to bring the action and visuals of martial arts movies to an adventure video game set in a mythical time in the far east .

" andy is taking care of all the performance capture , the casting and is heavily involved in writing . "

flagship game the team behind the game say the computing power in sony 's new console has allowed them to aim for a visual style more commonly associated with hollywood blockbusters .
the game features intense fighting sequences for example , said antoniades , one of the processors inside the machine is solely devoted to recreating the movement of clothes and hair .
" not many people believed what we showed was real , " said the game maker , referring to a trailer for the game shown at lasy year 's e3 games expo .
" this year we have proved ourselves to the doubters . "
a playable version of the game was on show at this year 's e3 .

the finnish study suggests embryo selection is an option for some older women - rather than simply using more than one embryo in each ivf cycle .
using more than one embryo raises the chances of a risky multiple pregnancy .
uk experts welcomed the human reproduction study , but said a culture change was needed . "
we need to work hard to explain the risks of multiple births to patients and also to lobby for better state funding to allow couples the option for single embryo transfer without worrying about money " dr allan pacey traditionally , the use of multiple embryos has been more common among older women , who are thought to have less chance of becoming pregnant during ivf .
currently , woman under the age of 40 should be offered one free cycle of ivf treatment on the nhs in england under government recommendations , although the final decision rests with local primary care trusts .
ministers have so far refused to fund three cycles for each woman , as recommended by the national institute for clinical excellence .
at the university of oulu clinic , where the latest study was carried out , four out of 10 women aged 36-39 are now treated with selected single embryo transfer .
as a result , the clinic 's rate of multiple pregnancy has been cut to less than 10 % .
multiple pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth , and other complications .
similar rates the researchers compared the results of more than 2,000 ivf cycles carried out in women in the older age group with those from younger women .
they found that , like younger women , a third of women aged 36-39 achieved pregnancy after a single ivf cycle using just one selected embryo .
the live birth rate was also similar : 26 % for the older age group , compared to between 27 % and 30 % for younger women .
the chances of a pregnancy rose to 54 % for women aged 36-39 who underwent more than one cycle of treatment using a single selected embryo each time .
the researchers also found that over several cycles of treatment single embryo transfer using selected embryos outperformed double embryo transfer .
while the pregnancy rate over time was nearly 55 % , the rate of multiple births was less than 2 % .
in contrast , the pregnancy rate among women who were treated with double embryo transfer was just 35 % , while the rate of multiple births was 17 % .
' instant families ' a spokesman for the human fertilisation and embryology authority said it had set up an expert panel to find ways to cut the number of multiple births resulting from ivf treatment .
dr allan pacey , honorary secretary of the british fertility society , said most uk professionals agreed using selected single embryo transfer as often as possible would have a huge impact in reducing the number of twins and triplets born as a result of ivf .
however , he said the success of single embryo transfer in countries such as finland had only been possible because ivf is so well funded by the state .
" in the uk , where the majority of couples are paying for their own ivf treatment , twins and triplets are often still seen by couples as an " instant family " without the need for repeated cycles of treatment .
" we need to work hard to explain the risks of multiple births to patients and also to lobby for better state funding to allow couples the option for single embryo transfer without worrying about money . "
dr pacey added that older women were less likely to produce high quality embryos , and that assessing quality was still not an exact science .
clare brown , of the infertility network uk , said : " it is understandable that the vast majority of couples are deeply unhappy about any move to single embryo transfer whilst there is still a severe lack of nhs funding for fertility treatment . "

the finnish study suggests embryo selection is an option for some older women - rather than simply using more than one embryo in each ivf cycle .
using more than one embryo raises the chances of a risky multiple pregnancy .
uk experts welcomed the human reproduction study , but said a culture change was needed .
we need to work hard to explain the risks of multiple births to patients and also to lobby for better state funding to allow couples the option for single embryo transfer without worrying about money dr allan pacey traditionally , the use of multiple embryos has been more common among older women , who are thought to have less chance of becoming pregnant during ivf .
currently , woman under the age of 40 should be offered one free cycle of ivf treatment on the nhs in england under government recommendations , although the final decision rests with local primary care trusts .
ministers have so far refused to fund three cycles for each woman , as recommended by the national institute for clinical excellence .
at the university of oulu clinic , where the latest study was carried out , four out of 10 women aged 36-39 are now treated with selected single embryo transfer .
as a result , the clinic 's rate of multiple pregnancy has been cut to less than 10 % .
multiple pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth , and other complications .
similar rates the researchers compared the results of more than 2,000 ivf cycles carried out in women in the older age group with those from younger women .
they found that , like younger women , a third of women aged 36-39 achieved pregnancy after a single ivf cycle using just one selected embryo .
the live birth rate was also similar : 26 % for the older age group , compared to between 27 % and 30 % for younger women .
the chances of a pregnancy rose to 54 % for women aged 36-39 who underwent more than one cycle of treatment using a single selected embryo each time .
the researchers also found that over several cycles of treatment single embryo transfer using selected embryos outperformed double embryo transfer .
while the pregnancy rate over time was nearly 55 % , the rate of multiple births was less than 2 % .
in contrast , the pregnancy rate among women who were treated with double embryo transfer was just 35 % , while the rate of multiple births was 17 % .
' instant families ' a spokesman for the human fertilisation and embryology authority said it had set up an expert panel to find ways to cut the number of multiple births resulting from ivf treatment .
dr allan pacey , honorary secretary of the british fertility society , said most uk professionals agreed using selected single embryo transfer as often as possible would have a huge impact in reducing the number of twins and triplets born as a result of ivf .
however , he said the success of single embryo transfer in countries such as finland had only been possible because ivf is so well funded by the state .
" in the uk , where the majority of couples are paying for their own ivf treatment , twins and triplets are often still seen by couples as an " instant family " without the need for repeated cycles of treatment .
" we need to work hard to explain the risks of multiple births to patients and also to lobby for better state funding to allow couples the option for single embryo transfer without worrying about money . "

but one of them , barclays , is also increasing its interest rate for some card holders .
barclay , lloyds tsb and hsbc will cut their penalty charges by nearly half from £ 20 to £ 12 in the next two months .
the changes were demanded by the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- in april , when it said standard penalty charges levied by card issuers were excessive and unfair .
the oft said at the time that the uk 's banks were illegally overcharging their customers by £ 300m a year through unnecessarily high charges .
these are levied for late payment of credit card bills , failed payments or spending more than a card 's borrowing limit .
the demand for lower charges brought howls of protest from the banking industry , but the banks were told to respond by 31 may .
the oft does not have the power to impose its order directly , but threatened to take legal action to do so if the banks ignored its instruction .
it also angered the banking industry by suggesting that basic bank charges , such as those for overdrafts , should be capped in a similar fashion .
royal bank of scotland , which owns natwest , has yet to announce a decision , but said it was still in discussion with the oft .
barclaycard barclaycard has more than 11 million uk customers in the uk , some of whom will now face paying higher interest rates . "
we have to reflect in our pricing the costs we incur in our business " barclaycard spokesman from 1 august , when the new lower penalty charge comes in , the interest rate paid by about 10 % of its customers will rise by between 2 % and 5 % , within a range of 14.9 % to 29.9 % .
cash advances will now be charged at 27.9 % , up from 21.9 % .
the bank said that only its most creditworthy customers would pay the lowest rate of 14.9 % .
a bank spokesman explained : " we have to reflect in our pricing the costs we incur in our business . "

but one of them , barclays , is also increasing its interest rate for some card holders .
barclay , lloyds tsb and hsbc will cut their penalty charges by nearly half from £ 20 to £ 12 in the next two months .
the changes were demanded by the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- in april , when it said standard penalty charges levied by card issuers were excessive and unfair .
the oft said at the time that the uk 's banks were illegally overcharging their customers by £ 300m a year through unnecessarily high charges .
these are levied for late payment of credit card bills , failed payments or spending more than a card 's borrowing limit .
the demand for lower charges brought howls of protest from the banking industry , but the banks were told to respond by 31 may .
the oft does not have the power to impose its order directly , but threatened to take legal action to do so if the banks ignored its instruction .
it also angered the banking industry by suggesting that basic bank charges , such as those for overdrafts , should be capped in a similar fashion .
royal bank of scotland , which owns natwest , has yet to announce a decision , but said it was still in discussion with the oft .
barclaycard barclaycard has more than 11 million uk customers in the uk , some of whom will now face paying higher interest rates .
we have to reflect in our pricing the costs we incur in our business barclaycard spokesman from 1 august , when the new lower penalty charge comes in , the interest rate paid by about 10 % of its customers will rise by between 2 % and 5 % , within a range of 14.9 % to 29.9 % .
cash advances will now be charged at 27.9 % , up from 21.9 % .
the bank said that only its most creditworthy customers would pay the lowest rate of 14.9 % .
a bank spokesman explained : " we have to reflect in our pricing the costs we incur in our business . "

the comedian , 34 , hopes to complete the 21-mile charity swim in under 16 hours .
a documentary covering his attempt will be shown on bbc one on 13 july .
walliams has spent the last 11 months training with former olympic pentathlete greg whyte .
" i reckon i have a 50/50 chance of getting across .
i hope people see it as a symbolic thing , " said walliams .
" i 'll just be in a pair of speedos and goggles - it 's what the public wants , " he added .
less than 10 % of people who have attempted to swim the channel have succeeded in reaching france .
" i 've always loved swimming but i did n't really think how cold it would be and how far , " said walliams , who will have to contend with high winds and waves of up to two metres .
mr whyte praised the comedian 's commitment .
" david has been working tirelessly over the past 11 months to make an attempt on the channel , demonstrating a level of work and commitment as great as any elite athlete i have met , " he said .
tough challenge the former olympic athlete described swimming the channel as " one of the toughest physical challenges on the planet " .
the famous stretch of water is one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes , with 600 tankers and 200 ferries crossing it every day .
walliams will set off from dover , kent , and cover himself in grease to keep warm and food will be fed to him from a pole on his support boat during the swim .
the public can sponsor him on the sport relief superswim website .
organisers are asking members of the public to raise money themselves by running a mile on 15 july .
sport relief has raised £ 30m for charities in the uk and abroad since it launched in 2002 .

a total of £ 2m has been allocated to knock down the former entertainment complex in douglas .
more than 50 holidaymakers died when a fire swept through the seven-storey building in august 1973 .
now it is being redeveloped but adrian duggan mhk says the island has already lost a considerable number of family entertainment venues .
tynwald voted for the demolition of the site last july , as it was dangerous and an eyesore .
the site 's future use has yet to be decided .
summerland is on the site of a former villa which was converted into a theatre and ballroom in 1877 .
douglas corporation bought it in 1964 , developing the site as the summerland complex which opened in 1971 .
the summerland disaster led to a major change in fire regulations on the isle of man and in the uk .

there is growing concern over government plans to privatise search and rescue services .
the politics show for yorkshire and lincolnshire reports .
beautiful but deceptively inhospitable , the region 's countryside attracts millions of visitors every year .
most people leave safely but some do not .
last year volunteers from the scarborough and district search and rescue team were called out on 40 operations , many of those involved working alongside the raf .
relationship changes the partnership has been built over decades and is one that andy crossley is worried about losing : " any change in working relationship is a concern .
andrew crossley : worried about changes " working with the raf we work on a level playing field , our services and theirs working in harmony together .
" whether that would continue with privatisation , i hope it would but it is a concern that we do have . "
so far details about exactly what changes will take place and when have been limited but the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has stressed the age of the current sea king helicopters mean changes do need to be made .
in a statement it said : " we have an opportunity to bring together the three current sar strands into one harmonised service , and in the process to deliver a service that is better value for money to the tax payer and is as effective as the current one . "
david was winchman and martin temple raf pilot privatisation could work former raf winchman david allen who spent many years based at raf leconfield believes that privatisation could work if it is handled properly .
" bringing it under one umbrella has got to be the way ahead .
the efficiencies of the whole thing are staring you in the face . "
but both he and his former colleague martin temple do fear that any purely civilian service could find itself hampered by health and safety issues and insurance requirements , issues that do n't effect military operations .
" at the end of the day if the job was called and the bell went it was up to the captain 's discretion whether he went on the job or not .
" he would decide at the time whether it was suitable and 99 times out of 100 he would go and at least give it a try .
" if any civilian organisation was constrained they may say no we can not do it so the job does not get done . "
is the rescue team threatened ?
early day motion and it is the uncertainty which has prompted the conservative mp for beverley and holderness , graham stuart , to put down an early day motion demanding answers .
for a start he wants to know where any private service would be based ?
what would happen to existing raf bases like those at leconfield and leeming ?
and above all why do changes need to be made to a service that many feel is second to none ?
graham stuart is mp for beverley and holderness " if there are effective services already provided you should be very careful before you stumble in and make changes on the basis that bigger is better .
" very often this government has gone bigger but it has not got better so we need to ensure that the service is protected and we need more detail .
" how they are going to make this happen ... we have no answers . "
but the mod says all that is still to be reviewed .
