" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?
push it off a cliff ! " or " how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up the tank ! " today , tourists can take part in a 90-minute trabi safari around the sights of berlin or dresden .
the tours , conducted in several languages , including english and spanish , also offer people the chance to drive one of the four-gear manual change cars complete with choke for cold winter days . the international trabi register is organizing a trabi rally in june next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the car 's production . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pimp my reunification ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .

the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

" when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .

" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?
push it off a cliff ! " or " how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up the tank ! " today , tourists can take part in a 90-minute trabi safari around the sights of berlin or dresden .
the tours , conducted in several languages , including english and spanish , also offer people the chance to drive one of the four-gear manual change cars complete with choke for cold winter days . the international trabi register is organizing a trabi rally in june next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the car 's production . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pimp my reunification ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? -lrb- 28.09.2005 -rrb- cult commie car exhaust canned an enterprising german has canned the malodorous exhaust fumes of east germany 's once maligned and now cult trabant car , selling the scent to those nostalgic for the former communist state .

" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?
push it off a cliff ! " or " how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up the tank ! " today , tourists can take part in a 90-minute trabi safari around the sights of berlin or dresden .
the tours , conducted in several languages , including english and spanish , also offer people the chance to drive one of the four-gear manual change cars complete with choke for cold winter days . the international trabi register is organizing a trabi rally in june next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the car 's production . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pimp my reunification ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? -lrb- 28.09.2005 -rrb- cult commie car exhaust canned an enterprising german has canned the malodorous exhaust fumes of east germany 's once maligned and now cult trabant car , selling the scent to those nostalgic for the former communist state .
-lrb- 19.07.2005 -rrb- germany in brief military service in germany may be shortened , trabis could soon be on the roads of africa and the price of a german pint is set to rise again .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .

it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found .

its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?

its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one .

" germany has agreed to send up to 2,400 military personnel to lebanon in the country 's first mission in the middle east since world war ii . interception mission off lebanon 's coast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german force consists of around 1000 marines a german maritime fleet of eight ships including two frigates with about 1,000 soldiers on board arrived off lebanon early october with a mandate to intercept arms shipments to the shiite militia hezbollah . krause accepted what he called a " truly demanding mission , " saying his force was " prepared and ready to react when the situation demands . " although germany has committed ships to unifil , having troops on the ground is a more sensitive issue because of the potential of conflict with israeli troops . de giorgi hailed the " excellent " cooperation of the lebanese navy , telling the lebanese people that " you cried out your right to life -lrb- and -rrb- you shall rise up again .

" the initial naval force consisted of italian , french , greek and british ships and will now be replaced by a force from bulgaria , denmark , germany , greece , norway , sweden and turkey . britain 's royal navy said in a statement that during its mission the taskforce had " challenged over 1,000 vessels approaching lebanese waters ... a handful were handed on to lebanese authorities .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card . " hoping for normalization as for makkabi , things are n't back to normal yet .
some of the regular players are afraid to play in eastern berlin where right-wing tendencies are higher .
a tv crew films the team 's practices and plain-clothes police officers accompany them to matches . " we do n't really want to play soccer under police supervision , " said the team 's director , claudio offenberg .
" we hope that the situation will stabilize . " makkabi 's umbrella organization in berlin , the house of soccer , is expected to announce a verdict on the case on monday , oct .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 15.10.2006 a new energy wave for europe in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wave power station off the portuguese coast should be put to use this fall the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .
experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card . " hoping for normalization as for makkabi , things are n't back to normal yet .
some of the regular players are afraid to play in eastern berlin where right-wing tendencies are higher .
a tv crew films the team 's practices and plain-clothes police officers accompany them to matches . " we do n't really want to play soccer under police supervision , " said the team 's director , claudio offenberg .
" we hope that the situation will stabilize . " makkabi 's umbrella organization in berlin , the house of soccer , is expected to announce a verdict on the case on monday , oct .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

" germany has agreed to send up to 2,400 military personnel to lebanon in the country 's first mission in the middle east since world war ii . interception mission off lebanon 's coast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german force consists of around 1000 marines a german maritime fleet of eight ships including two frigates with about 1,000 soldiers on board arrived off lebanon early october with a mandate to intercept arms shipments to the shiite militia hezbollah . krause accepted what he called a " truly demanding mission , " saying his force was " prepared and ready to react when the situation demands . " although germany has committed ships to unifil , having troops on the ground is a more sensitive issue because of the potential of conflict with israeli troops . de giorgi hailed the " excellent " cooperation of the lebanese navy , telling the lebanese people that " you cried out your right to life -lrb- and -rrb- you shall rise up again . " lebanese navy hopes to assume control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and italian ships make way for the germans lebanese deputy chief of staff for naval operations , brigadier general hassan mohsen , expressed his " deep thanks and appreciation to italy for their help after the last israeli aggression " saying he hoped his under-equipped navy would soon have " the right equipment to lessen the un 's responsibility . " the initial naval force consisted of italian , french , greek and british ships and will now be replaced by a force from bulgaria , denmark , germany , greece , norway , sweden and turkey . britain 's royal navy said in a statement that during its mission the taskforce had " challenged over 1,000 vessels approaching lebanese waters ... a handful were handed on to lebanese authorities . " unifil is enforcing a truce which ended fierce conflict between israel and lebanon 's hezbollah militia in july and august which left around 1,200 civilians in lebanon and 162 israelis dead .

" the prevailing hysteria over eads and airbus in germany at the moment is completely out of place .
we have real problems , but neither has a franco-german war broken out nor are eads or airbus on the verge of bankruptcy .
there is no reason for germany to enter as a shareholder , " enders said in an interview with the austrian daily die presse . " i do not see state involvement as a good thing , even what we already have , " said the german boss , who is co-ceo of the european aeronautics defense and space company with france 's louis gallois . the french state currently owns 15 percent of eads , while spain controls 5.48 percent via the state holding company sepi , and the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent of the group in september .

with lagardere and daimlerchrysler , industrial owners thus have the decision-making power . " enders admitted the company had " a blatant problem " with the a380 superjumbo which has had serious production delays , but added he was " confident that we can deliver the first plane in 2007 . " the german executive was in vienna on friday for the annual convention of the aerospace and defense industries association of europe . nine of the continent 's main aerospace manufacturers pledged at the convention to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions and air-traffic-related noise as part of the " clean sky " program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

" the prevailing hysteria over eads and airbus in germany at the moment is completely out of place .
we have real problems , but neither has a franco-german war broken out nor are eads or airbus on the verge of bankruptcy .
there is no reason for germany to enter as a shareholder , " enders said in an interview with the austrian daily die presse . " i do not see state involvement as a good thing , even what we already have , " said the german boss , who is co-ceo of the european aeronautics defense and space company with france 's louis gallois . the french state currently owns 15 percent of eads , while spain controls 5.48 percent via the state holding company sepi , and the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent of the group in september .

" glos called on daimlerchrysler to honor its " responsibilities " in the sell-off , which he said constituted an " industrial commitment " . daimlerchrysler committed to eads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the gloom over airbus , daimler is committed regarding the car-maker 's role , enders said " daimlerchrysler has made it clear it wants to remain a long-term shareholder .
with lagardere and daimlerchrysler , industrial owners thus have the decision-making power . " enders admitted the company had " a blatant problem " with the a380 superjumbo which has had serious production delays , but added he was " confident that we can deliver the first plane in 2007 . " the german executive was in vienna on friday for the annual convention of the aerospace and defense industries association of europe . nine of the continent 's main aerospace manufacturers pledged at the convention to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions and air-traffic-related noise as part of the " clean sky " program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around .

" the prevailing hysteria over eads and airbus in germany at the moment is completely out of place .
we have real problems , but neither has a franco-german war broken out nor are eads or airbus on the verge of bankruptcy .

with lagardere and daimlerchrysler , industrial owners thus have the decision-making power . " enders admitted the company had " a blatant problem " with the a380 superjumbo which has had serious production delays , but added he was " confident that we can deliver the first plane in 2007 . " the german executive was in vienna on friday for the annual convention of the aerospace and defense industries association of europe . nine of the continent 's main aerospace manufacturers pledged at the convention to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions and air-traffic-related noise as part of the " clean sky " program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?
push it off a cliff ! " or " how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up the tank ! " today , tourists can take part in a 90-minute trabi safari around the sights of berlin or dresden .
the tours , conducted in several languages , including english and spanish , also offer people the chance to drive one of the four-gear manual change cars complete with choke for cold winter days . the international trabi register is organizing a trabi rally in june next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the car 's production . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pimp my reunification ?

" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .

beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card .

" once you 've come to like a trabi , you 'll always want to have one , " said annegret ernst , deputy chairperson of the international trabant register based in the city of zwickau . like other trabi enthusiasts , ernst and her organization strive to maintain the cult status of the car , whose full name means " satellite " in german . some 3.7 million trabis were produced at the veb sachsenring automobilwerke zwickau from november 1957 until 1991 - two years after the fall of the berlin wall . despite its modest performance and smoky two-stroke engine , the trabi was the most common vehicle in east germany , and was also exported to other socialist countries . trabi blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after unification , the trabi lives on the collapse of communism made it possible for east germans to buy flashier western cars , leading to the market for the dour-looking trabant to dry up . at the end of production , the car 's two-cylinder engine delivered 25 horsepower -lrb- 19 kw -rrb- from a 600 cc displacement .
the car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and had a maximum speed of 112 km / h . its bodywork was made from a hardened plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton , which helped east germany 's centrally guided economy avoid expensive steel imports . the chassis construction pays off for today 's owners because it does not rust as much as metal ones .
its easy-to-repair engine " means you can do a lot of work yourself , " ernst said . motorists had to wait up to 15 years to receive their trabi , which remained largely unchanged in appearance for more than three decades . but when it finally arrived , it became a prized possession and was affectionately maintained to the extent that it was sometimes hard to tell a 10-year-old trabi from a new one . " go , trabi , go " although trabants had been exported from east germany , they only became well-known in the west after the fall of the berlin wall when many were abandoned by their eastern owners after migrating westward . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have found other uses for the cult car they also appeared in feature films like " go trabi go , " a comedy about an east german family making their way across europe , released shortly after reunification , and the more recent " good bye , lenin ! , " which took a nostalgic look at the fall of the wall . trabis also became the butt of jokes like : " how do you make a trabant go 100 km / h ?
push it off a cliff ! " or " how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up the tank ! " today , tourists can take part in a 90-minute trabi safari around the sights of berlin or dresden .
the tours , conducted in several languages , including english and spanish , also offer people the chance to drive one of the four-gear manual change cars complete with choke for cold winter days . the international trabi register is organizing a trabi rally in june next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the car 's production . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pimp my reunification ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? -lrb- 28.09.2005 -rrb- cult commie car exhaust canned an enterprising german has canned the malodorous exhaust fumes of east germany 's once maligned and now cult trabant car , selling the scent to those nostalgic for the former communist state .

" when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .

beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 15.10.2006 a new energy wave for europe in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wave power station off the portuguese coast should be put to use this fall the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .
experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

" the prevailing hysteria over eads and airbus in germany at the moment is completely out of place .
we have real problems , but neither has a franco-german war broken out nor are eads or airbus on the verge of bankruptcy .
there is no reason for germany to enter as a shareholder , " enders said in an interview with the austrian daily die presse . " i do not see state involvement as a good thing , even what we already have , " said the german boss , who is co-ceo of the european aeronautics defense and space company with france 's louis gallois . the french state currently owns 15 percent of eads , while spain controls 5.48 percent via the state holding company sepi , and the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent of the group in september . " of course the company has strategic importance -lrb- but -rrb- britain and the usa show that states can make their interests count without direct involvement , " he added . glos speaks out against reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos says he is against state involvement german economy minister michael glos also spoke out against his government 's reported plans to buy a stake in the eads group , which includes the troubled aircraft maker airbus , in an interview released on saturday . " participation by the -lrb- german state-owned -rrb- public bank kfw would make it hard to straighten out " the eads group , which includes the troubled aircraft maker airbus , glos said . he was responding to a report in the financial times that kfw and the german government were preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in eads . the stake would consist of a 7.5 percent holding , valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , which the german-us car maker daimlerchrysler is expected to sell , the newspaper said . german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that no decision had been made on a potential eads buy-out , though she had " not ruled anything out . " glos called on daimlerchrysler to honor its " responsibilities " in the sell-off , which he said constituted an " industrial commitment " . daimlerchrysler committed to eads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the gloom over airbus , daimler is committed regarding the car-maker 's role , enders said " daimlerchrysler has made it clear it wants to remain a long-term shareholder .
with lagardere and daimlerchrysler , industrial owners thus have the decision-making power . " enders admitted the company had " a blatant problem " with the a380 superjumbo which has had serious production delays , but added he was " confident that we can deliver the first plane in 2007 . " the german executive was in vienna on friday for the annual convention of the aerospace and defense industries association of europe . nine of the continent 's main aerospace manufacturers pledged at the convention to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions and air-traffic-related noise as part of the " clean sky " program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card . " hoping for normalization as for makkabi , things are n't back to normal yet .
some of the regular players are afraid to play in eastern berlin where right-wing tendencies are higher .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card . " hoping for normalization as for makkabi , things are n't back to normal yet .
some of the regular players are afraid to play in eastern berlin where right-wing tendencies are higher .
a tv crew films the team 's practices and plain-clothes police officers accompany them to matches . " we do n't really want to play soccer under police supervision , " said the team 's director , claudio offenberg .
" we hope that the situation will stabilize . " makkabi 's umbrella organization in berlin , the house of soccer , is expected to announce a verdict on the case on monday , oct .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .

" the prevailing hysteria over eads and airbus in germany at the moment is completely out of place .
we have real problems , but neither has a franco-german war broken out nor are eads or airbus on the verge of bankruptcy .
there is no reason for germany to enter as a shareholder , " enders said in an interview with the austrian daily die presse . " i do not see state involvement as a good thing , even what we already have , " said the german boss , who is co-ceo of the european aeronautics defense and space company with france 's louis gallois . the french state currently owns 15 percent of eads , while spain controls 5.48 percent via the state holding company sepi , and the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent of the group in september .

with lagardere and daimlerchrysler , industrial owners thus have the decision-making power . " enders admitted the company had " a blatant problem " with the a380 superjumbo which has had serious production delays , but added he was " confident that we can deliver the first plane in 2007 . " the german executive was in vienna on friday for the annual convention of the aerospace and defense industries association of europe . nine of the continent 's main aerospace manufacturers pledged at the convention to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions and air-traffic-related noise as part of the " clean sky " program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .
" he said he would stop the game as soon as he heard something . " but referee klaus brüning has repeatedly testified in court that he did n't hear a thing .
for 24-year-old liebermann , whose grandparents had survived life in a nazi ghetto , the evening game quickly turned into a nightmare . yellow card , red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger has made it clear that racism has no place in the stadium " at first , we just kept playing , but we got more and more nervous because every 10 minutes someone would shout ' jewish pig ' or ' burning synagogues , " ' liebermann said . the disruption came from a group of men standing next to the players ' bench on the altglienicke side .
beer bottles in their hands , the chants grew louder .
the makkabi players endured the humiliation for over an hour .
then , in the 78th minute of play , makkabi defender raffael tepmann shouted back at the chanters : " shut up , boys ! " tepmann was given a yellow card . " then i approached the ref and told him that if he had one ounce of respect for the history of this country he had to do something and help us , " liebermann said . liebermann was then given a red card . when he refused to step off the field , the whole makkabi team left together to avoid an escalation .
threats were made against the team , but the police did n't arrive until an hour later . concerns about right-wing extremists in the area after being informed of the incident later that evening , altglienicke 's youth coordinator sven klebe offered makkabi a written apology - the only one that came from his team . just a week earlier , the far-right national democratic party had won 18 percent of the votes in that district .
klebe said he was concerned that right-wing extremists could influence his soccer club . " we have taken security measures to ensure that a similar incident does n't occur at the championship game , " klebe said . giving racism the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah is a member of the german national soccer team theo zwanziger , head of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has spoken out against racism and encouraged the individual soccer clubs to put a lid on racist disturbances . when racist slurs were made in early september against germany 's ghana-born national player gerald asamoah , dfb fined the opposing team hansa rostock 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000 -rrb- .
the team was also required to play one home game without spectators . the fine is the highest dfb has ever imposed because of racism and the precedent-setting case is seen as a message to soccer clubs that they are responsible for their fans ' behavior . the authors of the study on racism by the federal institute for sport science recommended improving communication between fan groups , soccer clubs and the police . as an example , organizers will distribute symbolic red cards to spectators on the eighth game day in the season as part of a campaign called " give racism a red card . " hoping for normalization as for makkabi , things are n't back to normal yet .
some of the regular players are afraid to play in eastern berlin where right-wing tendencies are higher .
a tv crew films the team 's practices and plain-clothes police officers accompany them to matches . " we do n't really want to play soccer under police supervision , " said the team 's director , claudio offenberg .
" we hope that the situation will stabilize . " makkabi 's umbrella organization in berlin , the house of soccer , is expected to announce a verdict on the case on monday , oct .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .

however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .

a game last week in berlin is a disturbing case in point . local soccer games do n't usually draw much interest , but when spectators hurled anti-semitic slurs at jewish players during last week 's match between tus makkabi berlin and vsg altglienicke , heads turned across the country .
even german soccer federation president theo zwanziger got involved . the incident also supports a study presented last week in berlin by the federal institute for sports science , which indicated that , while racism is increasingly being practiced in professional stadiums with subtle codes and hand signals , it is still very apparent in the minor leagues . " when we went onto the field , i heard a few comments like ' germany is n't a jewish republic ' and ' no jewish state , ' so i went over to the referee and told him about it , " said vernen liebermann , a player for the jewish soccer team makkabi .

hamburg 's dream of bundesliga and european success is in tatters hamburg pushed bayern munich hard for the title last season before running out of steam .
this year , its star-studded team looked a good title bet .
instead , 14 games without a win , hamburg are now in free fall . an amazing combination of bad luck and stupidity has turned sv hamburg from a german bundesliga title contender into a drop zone club . a 2-1 home defeat against schalke 04 on saturday took hamburg 's winless streak to 14 competitive games , including all seven league matches this season .
the last victory dates back more than five months to may 2 , a 1-0 in the bundesliga at cologne . rafael van der vaart heads an injury list featuring six regular starters while david jarolim on saturday became the seventh player to be sent off in those 14 games .
to complete the agony on saturday , boubacar sanogo failed to convert a penalty against schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv boss hoffmann has been ready with excuses " we have the biggest imaginable -lrb- injury -rrb- disease , and stupidity on top of it , " said club boss bernd hoffmann .
the bild am sonntag sunday paper offered a different explanation , labeling hsv simply as a " shambles . " even though the team is classier now , hamburg are back where they were two years ago when thomas doll became coach in the autumn of 2004 in succession of klaus toppmöller . doll secure in coach 's job - for now doll led the club from last place at the time to third at the end of the past season .
he still has this bonus and the club is - for now - not looking for another man to take charge . " thomas doll was fantastic last year .
we believe he has an answer to the current situation .
i see no scenario in which we would have to take action in this area , " said hoffmann . however , the rules of the game also include a change at helm if success does n't come soon , the next chance coming sunday at bayer leverkusen , followed by an october 28 home game with hanover .
there is also a champions league trip to porto next week . doll , for his part , has defended his team despite mistakes and misbehavior .
" it really hurts to be so far down in the standings .
we have taken a big beating .
but we must learn from that and regroup , " said doll . quality additions need to stand up and be counted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorin and the other new boys are finding life tough given the quality of the team featuring the likes of van der vaart , newly-hired argentina captain juan pablo sorin , nigel de jong and vincent kompany , hamburg should be playing for the title . the task is not fully impossible despite the grim situation as no team has so far shone in a strange season in which hamburg are just eight points behind the leaders werder bremen , bayern munich and schalke . doll has appealed to his players that " we must finally finish a match with 11 players on the pitch " and new german international piotr trochowski believes that one win can turn everything around . " we need success to gain confidence which we badly lack right now .
we must finally win in leverkusen , " said trochowski . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg slide while dortmund rise bremen took over the bundesliga summit on saturday , ahead of bayern munich and schalke on goal difference while hamburg 's slump continues as the table stays tight after seven weeks of matches in the german top flight .

" unifil is enforcing a truce which ended fierce conflict between israel and lebanon 's hezbollah militia in july and august which left around 1,200 civilians in lebanon and 162 israelis dead .

experts say over 300 gigawatts of electricity could be tapped from european waters in the future . " imagine four bratwursts in the ocean , half underwater like submarines .
waves are surging at them from the front and the bratwursts are trying to ride them . " david lindley 's bratwursts are neither the beginning of a joke nor part of a cooking class .
instead , the british engineer 's symbolic sausages stand for a milestone in energy technology - wave power . portuguese for wave the first commercial wave power station in the world is located near agucadoura off the northern coast of portugal .
so far it has only been used for test projects and demonstrations , but the plant is scheduled to start delivering power as early as this fall . lindley is the director of the relatively young scottish company that developed the wave system , called ocean power delivery .
in reality , the bratwursts are 30-meter -lrb- 98.4-foot -rrb- long steel cylinders linked together in groups of four . " the tubes continually rise and fall and the motion turns the hydraulic pistons located between them , " he said .
" this pumps high pressure oil into an attached hydraulic motor , which then runs an electric generator . " bildunterschrift : energy is created in the links between the " sausages " room to grow the new wave park - the first wind park in the sea - will soon be expanded .
twelve new cylinders are to be anchored to the ocean bottom five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- off the portuguese coast . together they will only be able to produce about two megawatts of electricity .
however , plans for an additional 110 cylinders are in the works , which would produce enough electricity for 15,000 households . " there are many coastal areas that would be suitable for a wave park , " said lindley , mentioning spain , portugal , france , great britain , south africa , south america and the us . energy in european waters a recent status report from the european marine energy alliance called europe 's atlantic coast " highly energetic " and estimated that nearly 300 gigawatts of electricity could be drawn from it .
it would take 250 to 300 nuclear power plants to produce that much energy . it 's no coincidence that the first commercial wave power station was developed in portugal .
the portuguese government had decided to pay an ample 22 cents for each kilowatt hour supplied . " portugal will have five wave parks in five years at the latest , " said veronica la regina from the research center for wave energy in lisbon .
" by that time the environmental tests will have been completed and the best locations will have been found . " bratwurst in portugal , dragons in wales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " wave dragon " uses a system of ramps and turbines to produce energy in britain , regenerative energy is also catching on .
next year , a danish consortium is planning to send out its " wave dragon " off the southwestern coast of wales . these cylinders , decked out with dragon-like wings to catch the waves , are expected to supply over 70 megawatts of electricity - enough for 60,000 households . volker mrasek -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

last updated : sunday , 15 october 2006 , 07:55 gmt 08:55 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version wales : miners ' compensation dawn evans the politics show wales surface workers feel unfairly treated almost a decade ago the uk government started the largest compensation scheme of its kind for underground workers .
in 2006 , the amount of compensation paid to sick miners and their families passed £ 3bn - over £ 5m paid to workers in wales .
but those who worked on the surface of mines have not been able to claim a penny .
edgar james is one of the workers .
he worked on the surface at onllwyn washery for most of his life .
he was in daily contact with coal dust .
for over a decade , he has suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema and at 68 is disabled by his illness .
but despite his illness he can not claim compensation under the uk government 's scheme .
a dti promise fails malcolm wicks insists the dti 's compensation does not necessarily cover all coal workers the government once promised to change that .
in 2000 , the department of trade and industry put forward a statement to parliament .
it accepted it was unjust to keep surface workers out of the compensation scheme .
it said : " british coal did not fully meet its responsibilities to certain workers ... acceptance of this liability will mean that ... men who have only worked on the surface will be able to put in a claim " .
but six years on , surface workers are still waiting for compensation .
this year , the dti 's energy minister , malcolm wicks , said that they had not made " an open-ended admission of blanket liability " .
the minister said that its announcement six years ago was only the start , and not the end .
according to malcolm wicks the governments medical research has shown that levels of dust on the surface " would be very unlikely to lead " to pulmonary disease .
an injustice don touhig is standing firm in his support for surface workers ' compensation it also said that it can not pay out compensation on political and moral grounds alone .
however the former wales office minister , don touhig , said that he did not believe that it was just to deny compensation to surface workers .
" if he 's had his entire working life on the surface and is still suffering as a result of dust inhalation and so on , he does n't qualify .
now that is bonkers , as far as i 'm concerned .
i strongly believe that we should compensate these surface workers , " he insisted .

last updated : sunday , 15 october 2006 , 07:55 gmt 08:55 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version wales : miners ' compensation dawn evans the politics show wales surface workers feel unfairly treated almost a decade ago the uk government started the largest compensation scheme of its kind for underground workers .
in 2006 , the amount of compensation paid to sick miners and their families passed £ 3bn - over £ 5m paid to workers in wales .
but those who worked on the surface of mines have not been able to claim a penny .
edgar james is one of the workers .
he worked on the surface at onllwyn washery for most of his life .
he was in daily contact with coal dust .
for over a decade , he has suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema and at 68 is disabled by his illness .
but despite his illness he can not claim compensation under the uk government 's scheme .
a dti promise fails malcolm wicks insists the dti 's compensation does not necessarily cover all coal workers the government once promised to change that .
in 2000 , the department of trade and industry put forward a statement to parliament .
it accepted it was unjust to keep surface workers out of the compensation scheme .
it said : " british coal did not fully meet its responsibilities to certain workers ... acceptance of this liability will mean that ... men who have only worked on the surface will be able to put in a claim " .
but six years on , surface workers are still waiting for compensation .
this year , the dti 's energy minister , malcolm wicks , said that they had not made " an open-ended admission of blanket liability " .
the minister said that its announcement six years ago was only the start , and not the end .
according to malcolm wicks the governments medical research has shown that levels of dust on the surface " would be very unlikely to lead " to pulmonary disease .
an injustice don touhig is standing firm in his support for surface workers ' compensation it also said that it can not pay out compensation on political and moral grounds alone .
however the former wales office minister , don touhig , said that he did not believe that it was just to deny compensation to surface workers .
" if he 's had his entire working life on the surface and is still suffering as a result of dust inhalation and so on , he does n't qualify .
now that is bonkers , as far as i 'm concerned .
i strongly believe that we should compensate these surface workers , " he insisted .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website the security council vote imposing sanctions on north korea is a significant demonstration of international solidarity against a rogue state but whether it will force north korea to rethink its nuclear programme is another matter .
and the extent to which the measures will be applied also remains to be seen .
much will depend on china .
the united states had to make concessions to keep both russia and china on board , but nevertheless the chinese acceptance of what amounts to a blockade of nuclear and missile technology into and out of north korea is an important development .
trade in heavy conventional weapons , including tanks , combat helicopters and aircraft , warships and anything that might further the development of weapons of mass destruction is also banned .
china is unwilling to contemplate an end to the regime in north korea -lrb- so is not stopping its vital supplies of food and oil -rrb- but is also unwilling to accept its client state going too far out on a limb .
' symbolic dagger ' both china and russia insisted that the sanctions be applied under article 41 which means they have to be economic in nature and not military in threat .
they are however still under chapter vii which means they must be carried out by all member states .
a ban on selling luxury goods to the north has been thrown in as a small and probably symbolic dagger aimed at kim jong-il .
he is known to like the finer things in life and is now due , according to john bolton , the us ambassador at the un , to go on a " diet " .
" persons and entities " involved in banned trade will have foreign funds frozen and will face travel bans .
the vote is perhaps a pointer to the way china intends to conduct itself in the world as its influence increases - with caution and conditions , but with co-operation as well . "
the security council ... condemns the nuclear test proclaimed by the dprk on 9 october 2006 in flagrant disregard of its relevant resolutions " unsc resolution 1718 most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader china has its reservations about , and will not implement , a call on member states to check north korean cargo -lrb- by implication it means by land , sea or air -rrb- for contraband but it did not veto the proposal , while protecting what it saw at its own interests in avoiding a potential physical confrontation .
united states policy the vote also says something about the current state of play in the foreign policy of the bush administration .
it knows the limits of its military power in this case and can not afford to attack north korea so has settled for economic action through the united nations .
all eyes will watch to see if it chooses a similar path with iran . "
the sanctions policy and the lack of a military option basically means that containment is the order of the day for the indefinite future " on the other hand , the fact remains that international pressure on north korea of one kind or another has not worked .
nor has international inducement .
the north agreed in the six-party talks last september to give up its nuclear plans and was rewarded with a promise of electricity supplies and mutual assurances with the us that they would " exist peacefully together " .
a senior british official remarked on thursday that the security council was unusually united at the moment .
the next big task for it will be to consider what to do about iran 's nuclear activities and it will be interesting to see if this unity survives that .
containment the north koreans have blamed the united states for what they call " economic hostility " and it is unlikely that they will resume negotiations until they have calmed down on that front .
but it is not known if that claim is a reason for their action on nuclear weapons or an excuse .
whether they really will re-enter serious talks has to be open to serious doubt in any case .
what the north means by " economic hostility " is an american treasury-led assault on its dollar counterfeiting operations which , the us treasury said in 2005 , were based in a bank in macao .
this bank closed down its north korean accounts and the cut-off has apparently greatly hindered the means by which north korea gets its foreign currency , largely because other banks have been frightened off from dealing with the north .
the sanctions policy and the lack of a military option basically means that containment is the order of the day for the indefinite future .
the best hope now might have to be that one day the north 's self-imposed and self-glorified isolation will implode - and not with a bang .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website a ban on selling luxury goods to the north is aimed at kim jong-il the security council vote imposing sanctions on north korea is a significant demonstration of international solidarity against a rogue state but whether it will force north korea to rethink its nuclear programme is another matter .
and the extent to which the measures will be applied also remains to be seen .
much will depend on china .
the united states had to make concessions to keep both russia and china on board , but nevertheless the chinese acceptance of what amounts to a blockade of nuclear and missile technology into and out of north korea is an important development .
trade in heavy conventional weapons , including tanks , combat helicopters and aircraft , warships and anything that might further the development of weapons of mass destruction is also banned .
china is unwilling to contemplate an end to the regime in north korea -lrb- so is not stopping its vital supplies of food and oil -rrb- but is also unwilling to accept its client state going too far out on a limb .
' symbolic dagger ' both china and russia insisted that the sanctions be applied under article 41 which means they have to be economic in nature and not military in threat .
they are however still under chapter vii which means they must be carried out by all member states .
china and russia insisted the sanctions be economic , not military a ban on selling luxury goods to the north has been thrown in as a small and probably symbolic dagger aimed at kim jong-il .
he is known to like the finer things in life and is now due , according to john bolton , the us ambassador at the un , to go on a " diet " .
" persons and entities " involved in banned trade will have foreign funds frozen and will face travel bans .
the vote is perhaps a pointer to the way china intends to conduct itself in the world as its influence increases - with caution and conditions , but with co-operation as well .
the security council ... condemns the nuclear test proclaimed by the dprk on 9 october 2006 in flagrant disregard of its relevant resolutions unsc resolution 1718 resolution in full -lrb- 62k -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader download the reader here china has its reservations about , and will not implement , a call on member states to check north korean cargo -lrb- by implication it means by land , sea or air -rrb- for contraband but it did not veto the proposal , while protecting what it saw at its own interests in avoiding a potential physical confrontation .
united states policy the vote also says something about the current state of play in the foreign policy of the bush administration .
it knows the limits of its military power in this case and can not afford to attack north korea so has settled for economic action through the united nations .
all eyes will watch to see if it chooses a similar path with iran .
the sanctions policy and the lack of a military option basically means that containment is the order of the day for the indefinite future on the other hand , the fact remains that international pressure on north korea of one kind or another has not worked .
nor has international inducement .
the north agreed in the six-party talks last september to give up its nuclear plans and was rewarded with a promise of electricity supplies and mutual assurances with the us that they would " exist peacefully together " .
a senior british official remarked on thursday that the security council was unusually united at the moment .
the next big task for it will be to consider what to do about iran 's nuclear activities and it will be interesting to see if this unity survives that .
containment the north koreans have blamed the united states for what they call " economic hostility " and it is unlikely that they will resume negotiations until they have calmed down on that front .
but it is not known if that claim is a reason for their action on nuclear weapons or an excuse .
whether they really will re-enter serious talks has to be open to serious doubt in any case .
north korea 's neighbours are keen to avoid any conflict what the north means by " economic hostility " is an american treasury-led assault on its dollar counterfeiting operations which , the us treasury said in 2005 , were based in a bank in macao .
this bank closed down its north korean accounts and the cut-off has apparently greatly hindered the means by which north korea gets its foreign currency , largely because other banks have been frightened off from dealing with the north .

cardinal keith o 'brien said he would be " happy " if people in scotland wanted separation and claimed independence would come " before too long " .
in a newspaper interview , the cleric cited the success of smaller independent nations such as ireland and denmark to support his views .
he also voiced frustration with the current powers of holyrood .
the 68-year-old 's views have been welcomed by scottish national party leader alex salmond .
multi-national identities are harder to express than national ones cardinal o 'brien should church leaders speak publicly on politics ?
in an interview with the catholic herald newspaper , cardinal o 'brien said : " i would not get too involved in the politics of independence , but i am happy that , if it is the wish of the people , scotland becomes an independent country .
" there is currently some frustration among the scots about the say they have over what happens here , and that is part of what is pushing the independence movement .
" i can see this coming , perhaps not in the next few years , but before too long . "
as the leader of a scottish church , which is itself independent from england , he admitted it was difficult to argue for ecclesiastical but not political independence .
st george 's cross he also talked about the benefits other small countries have experienced since gaining independence .
" ireland would be an example of a country which has prospered since achieving independence , " he said .
" i am aware of a growing sense of nationhood and national identity in england , exhibited recently during the world cup campaign and reflected in the increasing appearance of the st george 's cross at such sporting fixtures and other gatherings .
" ultimately multi-national identities are harder to express than national ones . "
he said widespread public opposition to the government 's plans to replace the uk 's trident nuclear system " highlighted a deep sense of frustration among many scots " .
mr salmond said : " scotland 's cardinal is a man of vision and stature .
" obviously he avoids party politics but i am delighted that he has issued positive signals about independence and self-determination for the nation . "

it was the first time a woman has acted as a surrogate mother for her daughter in japan , local media reported .
the case is set to stir debate in japan where surrogate births are opposed by the government and a key medical group .
japan 's justice ministry also views the woman who gives birth as a child 's mother - not the biological mother .
this legal position has led a japanese celebrity couple to go to the courts to try to win the right to register twins born to a surrogate mother as their own children .
their case is continuing .
adopted yahiro netsu , the head of the suwa maternity clinic in nagano , told a news conference that the woman gave birth last year , reuters reported .
she had agreed to in vitro fertilisation and to act as a surrogate mother because her daughter had had her uterus removed due to cancer and was therefore unable to bear children .
both the mother and child were reported to be in good health .
dr netsu said the woman had first registered the baby as her own and then the child was adopted by her daughter and son-in-law .
the doctor , who has helped other couples to have children through surrogate mothers , called on the government and the medical authorities to review their stance against surrogacy .
surrogate births involve removing an egg to be fertilised and then implanting it in another woman who carries the baby to birth .

check-in worker nadia eweida , 55 , of twickenham , said she was effectively " forced " to take unpaid leave after refusing to conceal the symbol .
ba denied it had banned the wearing of crosses .
it said its uniform policy stated that such items could be worn if concealed underneath the uniform .
' double standards ' it said items such as turbans and bangles could be worn as it was impractical for staff to conceal them .
ba has been accused of double standards by some christian groups .
john andrews , communications officer for the diocese of bath and wells , said : " i think ba are being extremely offensive to members of the christian faith . "
he said : " it would be a great shame if christians are prevented from demonstrating their own faith .
it is a basic human right .
" if she is wearing it as a symbol of her christian faith she should be allowed to do it .
it is rather more than an ornament .
it is more than an item of jewellery . "
miss eweida , who has been with ba for seven years , said she wore the cross because of her deeply-held religious beliefs .
she is from an egyptian background and attends pentecostal as well as arabic churches .
kent conservative mp ann widdecombe urged a boycott of ba .
she said : " my view is that christians do not have to take this .
ba is a commercial organisation .
it 's not as if it 's the government . "
' loopy ' liberal democrat deputy leader vince cable , miss eweida 's mp , said of ba : " they are just being very bureaucratic and very inflexible .
for a commercial business this is not good enough . "
northern ireland secretary peter hain said he " did n't understand " the decision .
he said on bbc1 's sunday am programme : " frankly i think the british airways order for her not to wear a cross was loopy .
" i do n't understand it , i do n't think anybody understands it and that is my view . "
a ba spokeswoman said miss eweida had not been suspended .
she said the matter remained under investigation and an appeal was due to be heard next week .
she said ba recognised that uniformed employees may wish to wear jewellery including religious symbols .
" our uniform policy states that these items can be worn , underneath the uniform .
there is no ban .
" this rule applies for all jewellery and religious symbols on chains and is not specific to the christian cross . "

previous attempts to wipe out chinglish - the mistranslated phrases often seen on chinese street signs and product labels - have met with little success .
emergency exits at beijing airport read " no entry on peacetime " and the ethnic minorities park is named " racist park " .
beijing city authorities will issue new translation guides by the end of the year , xinhua news agency said .
running joke the booklets would be handed out to hotels and shopping malls , on public transport and at tourist attractions .
chinglish has become a running joke among many foreigners in china , and several websites have been set up listing humorous examples of mistranslation .
a road sign on beijing 's avenue of eternal peace warns of a dangerous pavement with the words : " to take notice of safe ; the slippery are very crafty " .
menus frequently list items such as " corrugated iron beef " , " government abuse chicken " and " chop the strange fish " .
the mistranslations arise because many chinese words express concepts obliquely and can be interpreted in multiple ways , making translation a minefield for non-english speakers .
the municipal government in beijing first tried to stamp out the problem just a month after being awarded the 2008 olympics back in 2001 .
a year later the beijing tourism bureau set up a hotline for visitors and residents to tip off examples of bad english , and said results would be reviewed by a panel of english professors and expatriates .
what are the more memorable examples of chinglish that you have seen ?
your comments : a lot of common errors were transposing errors , for example : first aid centre was fivst aicl centrt .
another sign read : help potect the cultural relecs , help protect the railings .
mark quan , toronto , ontario i have two favourites from spending many years working in china .
at the terracotta warriors museum in xi 'an a sign said " cherishing flowers and trees " which meant " keep off the grass " .
the other on a cruise on the yangtse river , " do n't bother " instead of " do not disturb " on the cabin doors .
there were many others but these always made me smile .
lee tomkow , santa barbara , california whilst living in beijing about a year ago , i came across a park in a residential area in the shunyi district which -lrb- although intended for use as a ' dog park ' -rrb- was translated to ' dog-bark park ' .
not to mention an apartment building which , for some bizarre reason beyond my knowledge was named " an australian lady and her lifestyle " .
james , spring , tx , usa at the simatai section of the great wall of china there is a sign that reads : people and flowers , plants help each other in breath , if you pick the flowers they will die , and you will reduce your life too .
a lovely message somehow gone somewhat wrong .
ollie boothroyd , windsor , uk " site of jumping umbrella " -lrb- paragliding site -rrb- michael pye , cambridge , uk " no striding " .
on a menu : " the oil explodes the shrimp " .
" pleasant aftertaste " .
on a sign : " keep fire in safe hands , we live in a safe world . "
emily , bremerton , wa , usa my favourite is : " please take advantage of the chambermaids " on a hotel brochure .
andrei pogonaru , bucharest , romania at one of the bigger train stations -lrb- and i 'm kicking myself right now because i ca n't remember which one ! -rrb- there is a huge , and i mean huge , sign which states simply " question authority " .
remember , this is an incredibly heavily controlled officially communist state .
the sign is merely pointing to the help desk .
peter douglas , edinburgh the taps in my hotel room in beijing had a fancy engraved sign " no drinking without dealing " - i suspect they meant " boiling " .
there are so many examples but my favourite may have been at the ming tombs " environmental sanitation of the scenic spot needs your conserve " - indeed it does .
david graves , seattle , usa forbidden : prostitution , gambling and drag abuse !
lou , beijing , china i have stayed in shanghai many times for work .
the new subway at jing an temple was proudly opened early for tourist trips .
all the east exits said " east exit " .
all the west exits said " wast exit " .
the next trip back the offending words were covered with duct tape .
james phethean , helston uk when i was living in beijing in 2000 , i saw a sign in front of a rock garden in the forbidden city that warned tourists " please do not climb the rocketry " .
craig , california airline pulp - the only english description on a snack package handed out with drinks on southern china airways .
andrew hobbs , henley on thames , uk while working in taiyuan , north of beijing we had the pleasure of visiting a local tourist attraction , one of the signs that had us chuckling was , " do not overtransgress " which is a good guideline , but i do n't think you would find a similar sign in an english speaking nation .
vincent vandenheuvel , strathroy , canada on a menu : worm pig stomach .
no thanks , i had it for breakfast , honest .
janet , edinburgh while staying in a hotel in china i noticed that in with the free -lrb- complimentary -rrb- bath stuff was a number of items for sale including a pair of boxer shorts labelled " uncomplimentary pants " ! !
stephen mowll , poole , dorset , uk from a recent trip to china to teach english , my favourite example of a mistranslated phrase belonged to a chocolate snack cake whose slogan promised : " this tastiness can not be carried , even with both hands . "
alia , austin , usa a sign in the shanghai metro read : " after first under on , do riding with civility " .

emda , created by the labour government in 1999 , promotes the regional economy with an annual £ 164m budget .
milan radulovic , leader of broxtowe district council , said emda 's administrative costs are too high and its decision-making is not transparent .
but emda leaders argue it is fully accountable and scrutinised by both parliament and east midlands assembly .
abolition call emda chief executive , jeff moore , said the agency created or safeguarded 8,193 jobs last year .
" it is our responsibility to cut through the labyrinth of bureaucracy , " he said .
he added : " i suspect councillor radulovic 's argument is with the government for the reporting regime it created rather than with the regional development agency -lrb- emda -rrb- itself . "
but councillor radulovic said : " i do n't call for the legitimacy of emda .
i call for its abolition .
it 's not achieved its objectives and as far as i 'm concerned it takes vital resources away from local industry and commerce . "
the government is moving to give regional quangos more power .
next year , the department for food , environment and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- will give regional development agencies the job of overseeing and funding a new programme to support economic development in rural areas .
simon fisher of the national farmers ' union said he thought emda would make a better job of helping farmers than defra .
but conservative mp caroline spelman , the shadow communities and local government secretary , said : " the regional development agencies remain only accountable to whitehall and i argue they should be accountable to elected local politicians that you or i could vote out if we do n't like it . "
nottingham businessman harry skidmore told the bbc 's politics show : " we -lrb- the business community -rrb- do support emda .
but to be honest i do n't think emda will ever understand business .
" so we ca n't ask them to understand business - what we want them to do is to give us a little bit more rope and support in terms of helping us to help ourselves . "

emda , created by the labour government in 1999 , promotes the regional economy with an annual £ 164m budget .
milan radulovic , leader of broxtowe district council , said emda 's administrative costs are too high and its decision-making is not transparent .
but emda leaders argue it is fully accountable and scrutinised by both parliament and east midlands assembly .
abolition call emda chief executive , jeff moore , said the agency created or safeguarded 8,193 jobs last year .
" it is our responsibility to cut through the labyrinth of bureaucracy , " he said .
he added : " i suspect councillor radulovic 's argument is with the government for the reporting regime it created rather than with the regional development agency -lrb- emda -rrb- itself . "
but councillor radulovic said : " i do n't call for the legitimacy of emda .
i call for its abolition .
it 's not achieved its objectives and as far as i 'm concerned it takes vital resources away from local industry and commerce . "
the government is moving to give regional quangos more power .
next year , the department for food , environment and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- will give regional development agencies the job of overseeing and funding a new programme to support economic development in rural areas .
simon fisher of the national farmers ' union said he thought emda would make a better job of helping farmers than defra .
but conservative mp caroline spelman , the shadow communities and local government secretary , said : " the regional development agencies remain only accountable to whitehall and i argue they should be accountable to elected local politicians that you or i could vote out if we do n't like it . "
nottingham businessman harry skidmore told the bbc 's politics show : " we -lrb- the business community -rrb- do support emda .
but to be honest i do n't think emda will ever understand business .
" so we ca n't ask them to understand business - what we want them to do is to give us a little bit more rope and support in terms of helping us to help ourselves . "
