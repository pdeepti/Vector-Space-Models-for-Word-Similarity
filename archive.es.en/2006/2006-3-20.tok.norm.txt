" hamas will have to decide which road to take , how to take the responsibility that is coming upon it now , " plassnik said . " our message has been clear and consistent .
it will be clear and consistent also in this situation , " plassnik said as she arrived for a meeting of the 25-member bloc 's foreign ministers . hamas remains defiant but hamas , whose senior members have been appointed to key portfolios , has shown little sign that it will agree to any , let alone all , of those conditions , which are also supported by the united states . its stance has left the eu , which sends around 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- a year to the territories , with a huge dilemma at a desperate time for many palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh after hamas 's stunning election victory in january , israel imposed sanctions on the palestinian authority , including withholding some 50 million euros a month in tax and customs duties . the world bank says the local economy could implode and unemployment double to some 40 percent .
on sunday , the united nations warned that the gaza strip is dangerously short of food and faces a humanitarian crisis . last month , the eu announced a 120 million euro package to help meet the basic needs of palestinians and pay public sector salaries , 64 million euros of which was signed over to the un on their behalf on monday . the bloc has since been studying ways to channel aid to the people and the caretaker government under palestinian leader mahmud abbas , while keeping money out of the hands of the militants . no punishment for the palestinian people british foreign secretary jack straw said the eu wants to continue to help the palestinians but that its next move would be up to hamas and the people who put it in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to hamas : british foreign secretary jack straw " we do n't want to punish the palestinian people for their votes at all , " he said as he arrived for the meeting . " on the other hand , the palestinian people need to say to any hamas government that democracy involves responsibilities , and above all a responsibility not to get involved in violence , " straw said . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said diplomatic movement could come after the elections in israel on march 28 . " i think today we are going to do all we can to see how we can help the palestinian people , that 's what is most important , " asselborn said .
" when the elections are over in israel , in a week , then we might be able to launch things again on a different level . " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said she hoped that hamas would soften its stance , but she warned that the union would not . " we leave the door open for positive change but at the same time we also have to make clear we can not go soft on our principles , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new hamas cabinet , belarus poll to top eu agenda european foreign ministers are holding talks on monday dominated by concern over the new hamas-led palestinian cabinet and president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping return to power in belarus .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .

it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .

petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !

in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .

dw-world.de spoke to polish coach pawel janas about his preparations for his team 's group round match up against the german hosts . the polish team rebou n ded from a disappoi n ti n g first rou n d elimi n atio n i n the 2002 world cup a n d failure to make it to the the 2004 europea n champio n ship by wi n n i n g all but o n e of their germa n y 2006 qualifyi n g matches a n d n ow are looki n g to ope n a n ew chapter of n atio n al soccer history . dw-world.de : i n 1974 , the last time the world cup was held i n germa n y , pola n d reached third place , the best result i n the history of polish soccer .
is a repeat performa n ce realistic ? pawel janas : first of all , i have to say that poland also made it to third place in the 1982 world cup in spain .
as a player , i was personally involved in that sporting event by playing every minute of all the games .
i think it testifies to the fact that the polish team has the opportunity to put in very good performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kamil kosowski , in red , suffered only one qualification loss e n gla n d were the o n ly o n es your team could n ' t be i n qualificatio n a n d you wo n the rest of the games .
is that a war n i n g sig n for your group oppo n e n ts germa n y , ecuador a n d costa rica ? there is only one thing my team thinks about at every game : winning .
to get back to your question , our opponents ' team trainers will have to come to their own conclusions . is n ' t it easier to play whe n you are u n derestimated a n yway ? you have to separate two things here .
we are not a favorite for this world cup , but the polish fans always put a lot of hope behind their team , which means we are " playing under pressure " to a certain degree . where did your team 's n ew stre n gth a n d rediscovered self-co n fide n ce come from ?
what makes the polish team so stro n g ? for the people who are familiar with the history of polish soccer , it is clear that our national team has n't had such bad results in the past few years .
we took part in the past world cup , and we were unlucky to be eliminated from the european championship in portugal .
so the reason we are continually able to improve our performances is not , as you said , " the addition of new strengths , " but , as i jokingly like to say our bad luck has finally left us ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish midfielder tomas frankowski was crucial to poland 's qualification campaign does the cou n try put polish soccer 's rebou n d dow n to your excelle n t work as trai n er or other factors like a n improved youth program or eve n just simple luck ?
how much tale n t is there ? this question deals with a very broad subject .
in the interests of keeping the interview somewhat short , i 'd say that all three factors played a role .
my " excellent work as trainer " is really just good work .
i 'd also especially emphasize that the polish national team 's success is doubtlessly due in part to work by club team coaches , inside and outside of poland , as well as the youth program . pola n d is especially stro n g i n the offe n se together - maciej zurawski a n d tomas fra n kowski scored 14 goals i n qualificatio n .
do these two have what it takes to be world cup greats ? yes , i think so .
but i still have to emphasize that no player has been invited to world cup team yet . how far will the polish team make it ? next question please . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann 's team will prove hard to beat at home how stro n g do you thi n k the germa n team is ? the german team is very balanced and it 's difficult to find its weak points .
germany is a candidate to win the world champion title .
i hope that our teams meet twice during this tournament . do you keep up with germa n soccer ? my staff and i have always closely followed german soccer , including in our consideration of our team members who play in the german league . do you thi n k germa n y will live up to its goal of hosti n g a n ope n , tolera n t a n d frie n dly tour n ame n t ? the germans are known as masters of organization around the world .
for many years german-polish relations have been really friendly , and that 's a word i 'm not afraid to use .
additionally , germany plays a meaningful role in europe , it is a founder of the eu .
i hope that answers your question . what 's your advice for the polish players ? keep a good atmosphere in the team , dedication to the constant improvement of team mates ' technical abilities , motivation during the games and an affection for improvisation and imagination . a n d who is goi n g to wi n the world cup ? brazil are my favorites , but germany should also win a medal . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the outsider 's view of germany 's world cup soap opera for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ?
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear .
-lrb- march 8 , 2006 -rrb- klinsmann gets merkel 's vote of confidence under-fire germany manager jürgen klinsmann received a vote of confidence from an unlikely quarter when chancellor angela merkel told him she was rooting for him .

what makes the polish team so stro n g ? for the people who are familiar with the history of polish soccer , it is clear that our national team has n't had such bad results in the past few years .
we took part in the past world cup , and we were unlucky to be eliminated from the european championship in portugal .

" recent results have affected our confidence and we were very nervous at the start , " admitted magath .
" but we scored the first and after that we played at the top of our game . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic scored a rare goal to put bayern ahead on 48 minutes and eight minutes later peruvian striker claudio pizarro produced a great chip finish .
" i think it came off my shoulder but i do n't care as it went in .
it was an important goal and we kicked on from there , " said salihamidzic . substitute roy makaay , who was dropped in favor of peruvian star paolo guerrero , scored late on to give the score line a flattering look . it was tough on schalke who had looked the more dangerous in the first half and had seen bayern 's argentine international martin demichelis avoid a clear red card following a blatant elbow .
with half-time approaching , demichelis wedged his elbow into the face of christian poulsen but bizarrely it was the danish international midfielder who got booked . " we started well and were the better team but we conceded from a set-piece and it was always going to be difficult here in munich , " said schalke 04 midfielder fabian ernst .
schalke 's defeat leaves them one point ahead of werder bremen in third . hamburg win keeps them as main title challengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg collected the points despite a lackluster display sv hamburg had moved to within three points of bayern after a 1-0 victory over vfl wolfsburg on saturday to put the pressure on bayern .
" it is a good sign that we can play poorly yet still take all three points , " said hamburg captain daniel van buyten . german international benjamin lauth , an outside candidate for a world cup spot , scored in the 22nd minute to seal the win . bremen tasted their second successive league defeat with a 3-1 reverse at fc nuremberg on saturday . german international forward miroslav klose scored his 18th goal of a terrific season , in which he is way ahead in the scoring charts , but it was not enough as bremen 's suspect defense collapsed again . " i think you can say we are in a mini crisis , " said klose .
" we all need to stick together and pull through this as soon as possible . " bremen and schalke 04 appear to be sparring for the third and final champions league spot with hamburg now five points clear of schalke and six of bremen . leverkusen 's decline continues with mainz surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz triumphed away for the first time in ten games at the bayarena bayer leverkusen 's slip into mediocrity continued with a 2-1defeat at home to mainz .
it was nine games without an away win for mainz but two goals by egyptian mohammed zidane put them in command at leverkusen and paul freier 's goal for leverkusen at the end came too late to save the home side . in a vital match for both sides , dortmund beat kaiserslautern 2-1 at home to keep their uefa cup hopes alive while kaiserslautern slipped further in their relegation fight .
brazilian dede put dortmund ahead only for kaiserslautern to equalize through erwin skela on the stroke of half time .
florian kringe put dortmund back in the lead after some great work on the wing by david odonkor mid-way through the second half . duisburg and cologne teeter closer to the edge duisburg continued their run as the bundesliga 's weakest away team with a 5-2 thrashing at frankfurt .
the home side were three goals up after only 13 minutes .
a hat-trick by ionnis amanatidis and goals by benjamin köhler and francesco copado gave frankfurt the points .
duisburg replied through adam bodzek and clemens lavric but on this evidence , their struggle to survive may be another losing battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne players consider another autopsy as hanover celebrate another side looking ominously at the drop is fc cologne .
the bottom club 's slim chances of escaping relegation took another setback as hanover kept up their hopes of playing in the uefa cup by moving up three places to sixth with a 1-0 home win .
iranian striker vahid hashemian gave hanover the deserved lead just before half-time and cologne struggled to fin any answer .
cologne seem certain to go down .

dw-world.de spoke to polish coach pawel janas about his preparations for his team 's group round match up against the german hosts . the polish team rebou n ded from a disappoi n ti n g first rou n d elimi n atio n i n the 2002 world cup a n d failure to make it to the the 2004 europea n champio n ship by wi n n i n g all but o n e of their germa n y 2006 qualifyi n g matches a n d n ow are looki n g to ope n a n ew chapter of n atio n al soccer history . dw-world.de : i n 1974 , the last time the world cup was held i n germa n y , pola n d reached third place , the best result i n the history of polish soccer .
is a repeat performa n ce realistic ? pawel janas : first of all , i have to say that poland also made it to third place in the 1982 world cup in spain .
as a player , i was personally involved in that sporting event by playing every minute of all the games .
i think it testifies to the fact that the polish team has the opportunity to put in very good performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kamil kosowski , in red , suffered only one qualification loss e n gla n d were the o n ly o n es your team could n ' t be i n qualificatio n a n d you wo n the rest of the games .
is that a war n i n g sig n for your group oppo n e n ts germa n y , ecuador a n d costa rica ? there is only one thing my team thinks about at every game : winning .
to get back to your question , our opponents ' team trainers will have to come to their own conclusions . is n ' t it easier to play whe n you are u n derestimated a n yway ? you have to separate two things here .
we are not a favorite for this world cup , but the polish fans always put a lot of hope behind their team , which means we are " playing under pressure " to a certain degree . where did your team 's n ew stre n gth a n d rediscovered self-co n fide n ce come from ?
what makes the polish team so stro n g ? for the people who are familiar with the history of polish soccer , it is clear that our national team has n't had such bad results in the past few years .
we took part in the past world cup , and we were unlucky to be eliminated from the european championship in portugal .
so the reason we are continually able to improve our performances is not , as you said , " the addition of new strengths , " but , as i jokingly like to say our bad luck has finally left us ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish midfielder tomas frankowski was crucial to poland 's qualification campaign does the cou n try put polish soccer 's rebou n d dow n to your excelle n t work as trai n er or other factors like a n improved youth program or eve n just simple luck ?
how much tale n t is there ? this question deals with a very broad subject .
in the interests of keeping the interview somewhat short , i 'd say that all three factors played a role .
my " excellent work as trainer " is really just good work .
i 'd also especially emphasize that the polish national team 's success is doubtlessly due in part to work by club team coaches , inside and outside of poland , as well as the youth program . pola n d is especially stro n g i n the offe n se together - maciej zurawski a n d tomas fra n kowski scored 14 goals i n qualificatio n .
do these two have what it takes to be world cup greats ? yes , i think so .
but i still have to emphasize that no player has been invited to world cup team yet . how far will the polish team make it ? next question please . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann 's team will prove hard to beat at home how stro n g do you thi n k the germa n team is ? the german team is very balanced and it 's difficult to find its weak points .
germany is a candidate to win the world champion title .
i hope that our teams meet twice during this tournament . do you keep up with germa n soccer ? my staff and i have always closely followed german soccer , including in our consideration of our team members who play in the german league . do you thi n k germa n y will live up to its goal of hosti n g a n ope n , tolera n t a n d frie n dly tour n ame n t ? the germans are known as masters of organization around the world .
for many years german-polish relations have been really friendly , and that 's a word i 'm not afraid to use .
additionally , germany plays a meaningful role in europe , it is a founder of the eu .
i hope that answers your question . what 's your advice for the polish players ? keep a good atmosphere in the team , dedication to the constant improvement of team mates ' technical abilities , motivation during the games and an affection for improvisation and imagination . a n d who is goi n g to wi n the world cup ? brazil are my favorites , but germany should also win a medal . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the outsider 's view of germany 's world cup soap opera for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ?
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear .

first of all , it 's none of your business .

" nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair . " he added that the " opposition candidates deserve respect and admiration for participating " in the election to prove that there were many people in belarus who want democracy and human rights . the berlarussian opposition has called for the poll which returned lukashenko to power with a resounding 82.6 percent of the vote to be declared invalid because of alleged fraud . lukashenko on monday rejected the call as " absurd . " eu mulls sa n ctio n s eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner meanwhile said the bloc would " very likely " bolster sanctions on belarus .

" recent results have affected our confidence and we were very nervous at the start , " admitted magath .
" but we scored the first and after that we played at the top of our game . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic scored a rare goal to put bayern ahead on 48 minutes and eight minutes later peruvian striker claudio pizarro produced a great chip finish .
" i think it came off my shoulder but i do n't care as it went in .
it was an important goal and we kicked on from there , " said salihamidzic . substitute roy makaay , who was dropped in favor of peruvian star paolo guerrero , scored late on to give the score line a flattering look . it was tough on schalke who had looked the more dangerous in the first half and had seen bayern 's argentine international martin demichelis avoid a clear red card following a blatant elbow .
with half-time approaching , demichelis wedged his elbow into the face of christian poulsen but bizarrely it was the danish international midfielder who got booked . " we started well and were the better team but we conceded from a set-piece and it was always going to be difficult here in munich , " said schalke 04 midfielder fabian ernst .
schalke 's defeat leaves them one point ahead of werder bremen in third . hamburg win keeps them as main title challengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg collected the points despite a lackluster display sv hamburg had moved to within three points of bayern after a 1-0 victory over vfl wolfsburg on saturday to put the pressure on bayern .
" it is a good sign that we can play poorly yet still take all three points , " said hamburg captain daniel van buyten . german international benjamin lauth , an outside candidate for a world cup spot , scored in the 22nd minute to seal the win . bremen tasted their second successive league defeat with a 3-1 reverse at fc nuremberg on saturday . german international forward miroslav klose scored his 18th goal of a terrific season , in which he is way ahead in the scoring charts , but it was not enough as bremen 's suspect defense collapsed again . " i think you can say we are in a mini crisis , " said klose .
" we all need to stick together and pull through this as soon as possible . " bremen and schalke 04 appear to be sparring for the third and final champions league spot with hamburg now five points clear of schalke and six of bremen . leverkusen 's decline continues with mainz surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz triumphed away for the first time in ten games at the bayarena bayer leverkusen 's slip into mediocrity continued with a 2-1defeat at home to mainz .
it was nine games without an away win for mainz but two goals by egyptian mohammed zidane put them in command at leverkusen and paul freier 's goal for leverkusen at the end came too late to save the home side . in a vital match for both sides , dortmund beat kaiserslautern 2-1 at home to keep their uefa cup hopes alive while kaiserslautern slipped further in their relegation fight .
brazilian dede put dortmund ahead only for kaiserslautern to equalize through erwin skela on the stroke of half time .

we took part in the past world cup , and we were unlucky to be eliminated from the european championship in portugal .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .

the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !

in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .
last year , a department store donated a batch of underwear , while the german actors ' association contributed a pair of self-crocheted lace panties filled with 100 euros -lrb- $ 122 -rrb- . one wonders whether filling lace panties with money is exactly what the pious eighteenth-century german lady would have considered appropriate .
but she would 've been happy to learn that in northern germany the sun is still shining -lrb- occasionally -rrb- and the wind blowing -lrb- a lot -rrb- , which means that the underwear will keep falling from the sky . and so , when you do run into the next german guy buying panties , give the guy a break .
remember that charity is a virtue , smile , and move on . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for more quirky stories from germany .
flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere .

yes ! " reads the poster with a picture of lukashenko belarus ' president alexander lukashenko cruised to election victory monday as opponents vowed to continue protests against a vote they said had been rigged and the west prepared to give its own assessment . lukashenko , 51 , was elected with 82.6 percent of the vote at sunday 's presidential election , compared to 6 percent for his nearest rival , alexander milinkevich , said the chairwoman of the central election commission , lidiya yermoshina . the figures remained unchanged as the final ballots were counted , officials quoted by the itar-tass news agency said . there was no immediate reaction from the belarussian leader , who has held the post since 1994 , although he earlier said he expected a " normal result " and would be passing sunday evening " quietly .

" the participation of many observers allows a more objective evaluation of the elections , from various points of view , " rushailo said on national television . west aghast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of belarus opposition from lithuania and poland hold and wave banned belarusian flags during a meeting at the lithuanian-belarusian border crossing sunday there appeared little chance of an improvement in lukashenko 's relations with the west , as the european union and the united states have been aghast at the prospect of him having a third term . the west has objected to the state 's iron grip on the press , has accused belarussian authorities of human rights abuses , and took particular exception to a 2004 referendum that enabled lukashenko 's candidacy as it abolished a two-term limit on holding the presidency . on sunday lukashenko branded us president george w. bush " the number one terrorist on the planet " , the latest phase in a war of words that has seen washington dub belarus " europe 's last dictatorship .

" recent results have affected our confidence and we were very nervous at the start , " admitted magath .
" but we scored the first and after that we played at the top of our game . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic scored a rare goal to put bayern ahead on 48 minutes and eight minutes later peruvian striker claudio pizarro produced a great chip finish .
" i think it came off my shoulder but i do n't care as it went in .
it was an important goal and we kicked on from there , " said salihamidzic . substitute roy makaay , who was dropped in favor of peruvian star paolo guerrero , scored late on to give the score line a flattering look . it was tough on schalke who had looked the more dangerous in the first half and had seen bayern 's argentine international martin demichelis avoid a clear red card following a blatant elbow .
with half-time approaching , demichelis wedged his elbow into the face of christian poulsen but bizarrely it was the danish international midfielder who got booked . " we started well and were the better team but we conceded from a set-piece and it was always going to be difficult here in munich , " said schalke 04 midfielder fabian ernst .
schalke 's defeat leaves them one point ahead of werder bremen in third . hamburg win keeps them as main title challengers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg collected the points despite a lackluster display sv hamburg had moved to within three points of bayern after a 1-0 victory over vfl wolfsburg on saturday to put the pressure on bayern .
" it is a good sign that we can play poorly yet still take all three points , " said hamburg captain daniel van buyten . german international benjamin lauth , an outside candidate for a world cup spot , scored in the 22nd minute to seal the win . bremen tasted their second successive league defeat with a 3-1 reverse at fc nuremberg on saturday . german international forward miroslav klose scored his 18th goal of a terrific season , in which he is way ahead in the scoring charts , but it was not enough as bremen 's suspect defense collapsed again . " i think you can say we are in a mini crisis , " said klose .
" we all need to stick together and pull through this as soon as possible .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair . " he added that the " opposition candidates deserve respect and admiration for participating " in the election to prove that there were many people in belarus who want democracy and human rights . the berlarussian opposition has called for the poll which returned lukashenko to power with a resounding 82.6 percent of the vote to be declared invalid because of alleged fraud . lukashenko on monday rejected the call as " absurd . " eu mulls sa n ctio n s eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner meanwhile said the bloc would " very likely " bolster sanctions on belarus .
the eu 's austrian presidency had earlier lamented a climate of intimidation clouding the elections in the former soviet republic . " from what we have seen so far my view is some action is now very likely indeed , " said ferrero-waldner , who has warned repeatedly in recent weeks that the eu could strengthen sanctions if it was not happy about the belarusian presidential election . speaking to reporters as eu foreign ministers discussed belarus at scheduled talks in brussels , she said there was unlikely to be any immediate decision , adding that the eu was waiting for a report by election monitors due later in the day . european commission vice president günter verheugen said that no one would believe the election which swept lukashenko to a third term in office was free and fair . verheuge n says n o place i n eu for a dictatorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said no one would believe the elections were fair " no one will be fooled by this election result or indeed by the whole election , " verheugen told deutschlandradio kultur after it was announced that lukashenko had won sunday 's election with 82.6 percent of the vote . verheugen , a german , dismissed claims that belarus could aspire to membership of the european union . " this country is the last real dictatorship in europe and as long as it remains so it can not be a partner for the european union , " he said . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who chaired the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , told reporters : " the climate of intimidation and hindering of the opposition to do their work was upsetting .

" we will propose the strengthening of sanctions , " he said .
" it is evident that belarus elections were not free and democratic .
the eu must act . " komorowski said he would propose a visa ban on belarus officials deemed responsible for election rigging if the offence could be proved .
he also said that a possible freeze on financial assets abroad and possibly wider targeted economic sanctions would also be put forward .
sanctions " must be constructed in such a way that they do not harm average people , " komorowski added . oppo n e n ts of sa n ctio n s fewer i n n umber however , not all the eu ministers were in favor of action against belarus . " there is no good reason to impose economic sanctions , " said czech foreign minister cyril svoboda .

dw-world.de spoke to polish coach pawel janas about his preparations for his team 's group round match up against the german hosts . the polish team rebou n ded from a disappoi n ti n g first rou n d elimi n atio n i n the 2002 world cup a n d failure to make it to the the 2004 europea n champio n ship by wi n n i n g all but o n e of their germa n y 2006 qualifyi n g matches a n d n ow are looki n g to ope n a n ew chapter of n atio n al soccer history . dw-world.de : i n 1974 , the last time the world cup was held i n germa n y , pola n d reached third place , the best result i n the history of polish soccer .
is a repeat performa n ce realistic ? pawel janas : first of all , i have to say that poland also made it to third place in the 1982 world cup in spain .
as a player , i was personally involved in that sporting event by playing every minute of all the games .
i think it testifies to the fact that the polish team has the opportunity to put in very good performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kamil kosowski , in red , suffered only one qualification loss e n gla n d were the o n ly o n es your team could n ' t be i n qualificatio n a n d you wo n the rest of the games .
is that a war n i n g sig n for your group oppo n e n ts germa n y , ecuador a n d costa rica ? there is only one thing my team thinks about at every game : winning .
to get back to your question , our opponents ' team trainers will have to come to their own conclusions . is n ' t it easier to play whe n you are u n derestimated a n yway ? you have to separate two things here .
we are not a favorite for this world cup , but the polish fans always put a lot of hope behind their team , which means we are " playing under pressure " to a certain degree . where did your team 's n ew stre n gth a n d rediscovered self-co n fide n ce come from ?
what makes the polish team so stro n g ? for the people who are familiar with the history of polish soccer , it is clear that our national team has n't had such bad results in the past few years .
we took part in the past world cup , and we were unlucky to be eliminated from the european championship in portugal .
so the reason we are continually able to improve our performances is not , as you said , " the addition of new strengths , " but , as i jokingly like to say our bad luck has finally left us ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish midfielder tomas frankowski was crucial to poland 's qualification campaign does the cou n try put polish soccer 's rebou n d dow n to your excelle n t work as trai n er or other factors like a n improved youth program or eve n just simple luck ?
how much tale n t is there ? this question deals with a very broad subject .
in the interests of keeping the interview somewhat short , i 'd say that all three factors played a role .
my " excellent work as trainer " is really just good work .
i 'd also especially emphasize that the polish national team 's success is doubtlessly due in part to work by club team coaches , inside and outside of poland , as well as the youth program . pola n d is especially stro n g i n the offe n se together - maciej zurawski a n d tomas fra n kowski scored 14 goals i n qualificatio n .
do these two have what it takes to be world cup greats ? yes , i think so .
but i still have to emphasize that no player has been invited to world cup team yet . how far will the polish team make it ? next question please . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann 's team will prove hard to beat at home how stro n g do you thi n k the germa n team is ? the german team is very balanced and it 's difficult to find its weak points .
germany is a candidate to win the world champion title .
i hope that our teams meet twice during this tournament . do you keep up with germa n soccer ? my staff and i have always closely followed german soccer , including in our consideration of our team members who play in the german league . do you thi n k germa n y will live up to its goal of hosti n g a n ope n , tolera n t a n d frie n dly tour n ame n t ? the germans are known as masters of organization around the world .
for many years german-polish relations have been really friendly , and that 's a word i 'm not afraid to use .
additionally , germany plays a meaningful role in europe , it is a founder of the eu .
i hope that answers your question . what 's your advice for the polish players ? keep a good atmosphere in the team , dedication to the constant improvement of team mates ' technical abilities , motivation during the games and an affection for improvisation and imagination . a n d who is goi n g to wi n the world cup ? brazil are my favorites , but germany should also win a medal . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the outsider 's view of germany 's world cup soap opera for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ?
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear .
-lrb- march 8 , 2006 -rrb- klinsmann gets merkel 's vote of confidence under-fire germany manager jürgen klinsmann received a vote of confidence from an unlikely quarter when chancellor angela merkel told him she was rooting for him .

" recent results have affected our confidence and we were very nervous at the start , " admitted magath .
" but we scored the first and after that we played at the top of our game . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic scored a rare goal to put bayern ahead on 48 minutes and eight minutes later peruvian striker claudio pizarro produced a great chip finish .
" i think it came off my shoulder but i do n't care as it went in .
it was an important goal and we kicked on from there , " said salihamidzic . substitute roy makaay , who was dropped in favor of peruvian star paolo guerrero , scored late on to give the score line a flattering look . it was tough on schalke who had looked the more dangerous in the first half and had seen bayern 's argentine international martin demichelis avoid a clear red card following a blatant elbow .
with half-time approaching , demichelis wedged his elbow into the face of christian poulsen but bizarrely it was the danish international midfielder who got booked .

" recent results have affected our confidence and we were very nervous at the start , " admitted magath .
" but we scored the first and after that we played at the top of our game . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic scored a rare goal to put bayern ahead on 48 minutes and eight minutes later peruvian striker claudio pizarro produced a great chip finish .

it was an important goal and we kicked on from there , " said salihamidzic . substitute roy makaay , who was dropped in favor of peruvian star paolo guerrero , scored late on to give the score line a flattering look . it was tough on schalke who had looked the more dangerous in the first half and had seen bayern 's argentine international martin demichelis avoid a clear red card following a blatant elbow .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair . " he added that the " opposition candidates deserve respect and admiration for participating " in the election to prove that there were many people in belarus who want democracy and human rights . the berlarussian opposition has called for the poll which returned lukashenko to power with a resounding 82.6 percent of the vote to be declared invalid because of alleged fraud . lukashenko on monday rejected the call as " absurd . " eu mulls sa n ctio n s eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner meanwhile said the bloc would " very likely " bolster sanctions on belarus .
the eu 's austrian presidency had earlier lamented a climate of intimidation clouding the elections in the former soviet republic . " from what we have seen so far my view is some action is now very likely indeed , " said ferrero-waldner , who has warned repeatedly in recent weeks that the eu could strengthen sanctions if it was not happy about the belarusian presidential election . speaking to reporters as eu foreign ministers discussed belarus at scheduled talks in brussels , she said there was unlikely to be any immediate decision , adding that the eu was waiting for a report by election monitors due later in the day . european commission vice president günter verheugen said that no one would believe the election which swept lukashenko to a third term in office was free and fair . verheuge n says n o place i n eu for a dictatorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said no one would believe the elections were fair " no one will be fooled by this election result or indeed by the whole election , " verheugen told deutschlandradio kultur after it was announced that lukashenko had won sunday 's election with 82.6 percent of the vote . verheugen , a german , dismissed claims that belarus could aspire to membership of the european union . " this country is the last real dictatorship in europe and as long as it remains so it can not be a partner for the european union , " he said . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who chaired the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , told reporters : " the climate of intimidation and hindering of the opposition to do their work was upsetting .

" it is evident that belarus elections were not free and democratic .
the eu must act . " komorowski said he would propose a visa ban on belarus officials deemed responsible for election rigging if the offence could be proved .
he also said that a possible freeze on financial assets abroad and possibly wider targeted economic sanctions would also be put forward .
sanctions " must be constructed in such a way that they do not harm average people , " komorowski added . oppo n e n ts of sa n ctio n s fewer i n n umber however , not all the eu ministers were in favor of action against belarus . " there is no good reason to impose economic sanctions , " said czech foreign minister cyril svoboda .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .

" reads the poster with a picture of lukashenko belarus ' president alexander lukashenko cruised to election victory monday as opponents vowed to continue protests against a vote they said had been rigged and the west prepared to give its own assessment . lukashenko , 51 , was elected with 82.6 percent of the vote at sunday 's presidential election , compared to 6 percent for his nearest rival , alexander milinkevich , said the chairwoman of the central election commission , lidiya yermoshina . the figures remained unchanged as the final ballots were counted , officials quoted by the itar-tass news agency said . there was no immediate reaction from the belarussian leader , who has held the post since 1994 , although he earlier said he expected a " normal result " and would be passing sunday evening " quietly .

both reiterated during the last week that they had not had any contact with enel . " we are living in the modern world , " said cirelli last thursday .
" there are telephones and if the enel management wants to get in touch with us we will take their call and listen to them . " enel chief fulvio conti for his part was set to meet kroes tuesday to outline his takeover plans . the eu commission has meanwhile been examining written explanations submitted by the french government of how the proposed suez-gdf merger evolved and is expected to give its opinion by the end of march . french economy and finance minister thierry breton , who met last monday in brussels with italian counterpart giulio tremonti , said there had previously been no negotiations between italy and france .

german defense minister franz josef jung said that germany had dropped its initial reluctance to lead the force . if agreed , germa n y will head the eu operatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung and steinmeier are confident that the mission will be approved " after 15 european nations agreed to take part in the mission , we are now willing to lead them from our operations control center in potsdam , " jung said .

german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier told the german parliament that the eu had a vested interest in the country and the region as a whole . the eu has invested 800 million euros -lrb- $ 974 million -rrb- in the process of political transition towards democracy in the drc . " the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .
the german government is confident that it will get parliamentary approval for the mission during a vote scheduled for early april . critics comi n g rou n d to eu 's role i n the co n go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu force would show the congolese that they are not forgotten but many deputies in the bundestag are still skeptical .
social democrat rolf kramer , one of the critics of the congo mission , has just returned from a fact-finding mission to that country .
he says he has now changed his mind . " my talks with representatives in kinshasa have made me change my opinion , " he said .

" there are telephones and if the enel management wants to get in touch with us we will take their call and listen to them . " enel chief fulvio conti for his part was set to meet kroes tuesday to outline his takeover plans . the eu commission has meanwhile been examining written explanations submitted by the french government of how the proposed suez-gdf merger evolved and is expected to give its opinion by the end of march . french economy and finance minister thierry breton , who met last monday in brussels with italian counterpart giulio tremonti , said there had previously been no negotiations between italy and france .

it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .

but she would 've been happy to learn that in northern germany the sun is still shining -lrb- occasionally -rrb- and the wind blowing -lrb- a lot -rrb- , which means that the underwear will keep falling from the sky . and so , when you do run into the next german guy buying panties , give the guy a break .

" there are telephones and if the enel management wants to get in touch with us we will take their call and listen to them . " enel chief fulvio conti for his part was set to meet kroes tuesday to outline his takeover plans . the eu commission has meanwhile been examining written explanations submitted by the french government of how the proposed suez-gdf merger evolved and is expected to give its opinion by the end of march . french economy and finance minister thierry breton , who met last monday in brussels with italian counterpart giulio tremonti , said there had previously been no negotiations between italy and france .

" the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .

german defense minister franz josef jung said that germany had dropped its initial reluctance to lead the force . if agreed , germa n y will head the eu operatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung and steinmeier are confident that the mission will be approved " after 15 european nations agreed to take part in the mission , we are now willing to lead them from our operations control center in potsdam , " jung said .

" the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .

on sunday , the united nations warned that the gaza strip is dangerously short of food and faces a humanitarian crisis . " it is a very tricky situation , " said an eu official with intimate knowledge of the region .
" but it is simply not possible for us to fund a government who refuses israel 's right to exist . " a sweeping victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is expecting an osce report about the belarus elections on belarus , meanwhile , the ministers will discuss lukashenko 's return to office - with more than 80 percent of sunday 's vote according to official preliminary results - amid opposition calls to cancel the poll . ahead of the meeting , eu officials said the ministers would await a report from monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- before issuing any reaction . the union already has sanctions in place against belarus officials , and while no new measures will be announced at the talks , they could come up when eu leaders meet in brussels on thursday and friday . lukashenko 's regime , accused in the west of stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the polls , warned before the vote that it would " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's " - of any disorder . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana also on the agenda will be the eu 's plans to send troops to the democratic republic of congo to help with key elections in june . the ministers will hear a report from eu foreign policy chief javier solana following his visit to kinshasa , but it is unclear whether they can firm up their plans given widespread reluctance to lead the operation . apart from preparing for the summit , the ministers will also discuss iran , iraq and sudan , and warn serbia it must fully cooperate with the un war crimes court if it wants to avoid disruption to its rapprochement talks with the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition accuses lukashenko of manipulating belarus vote belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko looked set for landslide re-election sunday amid opposition claims of vote-rigging and fear of violence after authorities vowed to crush protests .

german defense minister franz josef jung said that germany had dropped its initial reluctance to lead the force . if agreed , germa n y will head the eu operatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung and steinmeier are confident that the mission will be approved " after 15 european nations agreed to take part in the mission , we are now willing to lead them from our operations control center in potsdam , " jung said .
" our french partners will be in command on the ground in kinshasa so that i 'm fully convinced that this partnership will guarantee a successful eu mission aimed at preserving peace during the elections . " in december , the united nations asked the european union to reinforce its 16,000-strong peacekeeping force to boost security a series of pivotal elections in the country .
the drc , which is still reeling from five years of civil war , has not had free democratic elections in over 40 years .

german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier told the german parliament that the eu had a vested interest in the country and the region as a whole . the eu has invested 800 million euros -lrb- $ 974 million -rrb- in the process of political transition towards democracy in the drc . " the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .
the german government is confident that it will get parliamentary approval for the mission during a vote scheduled for early april . critics comi n g rou n d to eu 's role i n the co n go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu force would show the congolese that they are not forgotten but many deputies in the bundestag are still skeptical .
social democrat rolf kramer , one of the critics of the congo mission , has just returned from a fact-finding mission to that country .
he says he has now changed his mind . " my talks with representatives in kinshasa have made me change my opinion , " he said .
" i now fully agree that the eu force is necessary to show to the local population that the international community is at their side .

" all the unions are calling to make march 28 a day of demonstrations , strikes and work stoppages , " said rene valadon , secretary of the force ouvriere union , after a meeting of france 's main unions , student and high school groups . another union leader , gerard aschieri of the federation of united unions , told reuters that public and private workers would go " hand in hand " during the day of action . villepin stood by his contested youth jobs plan monday , as an ultimatum for its withdrawal passed with no hint of concession and unions promised a new day of nationwide protests next week . " laws of the republic , voted democratically by parliament , must be respected , " villepin said in a letter sent to members of his centre-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . he held meetings with students and employers on monday to discuss their concerns and promote the law . support from president the prime minister won support from his close ally president jacques chirac , to whom opponents of the cpe appealed earlier to use his influence to have the contract abandoned . chirac said that " it is essential to take steps for youth employment , and the cpe is a sign of this determination on the part of the government and parliament .

we can step up the mobilisation .
we have got such a dynamic behind us we are bound to make the government give way , " said bruno julliard of the unef students ' union . crisis for villepin opposition to the law has provoked a crisis for villepin , which could harm his chances of running for president in 2007 and damage the ump party .

it 's raining knickers in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as the sun shines and the wind blows , the ladies will have their panties what inspires karl-günther petters , pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg , to buy ladies ' underwear ?
it 's not a matter of personal taste or secret passion .
it is a sense of charity . next time you see a german man buying ladies ' underwear in a department store , you should really think twice before making a snickering remark .
first of all , it 's none of your business .
and , second of all , the man in question could be a man of the cloth on a special church mission . take karl-günther petters for example .
petters is the head pastor of st. jacob 's church in the northern german city of hamburg .
his job - in addition to guiding the souls of his parish and taking care of their well-being - includes buying ladies ' panties . not for personal use , of course .
the bizarre deal dates back to 1762 , when a charitable hamburg lady called johanna margretha eding bequeathed 850 marks to st. jacob 's for charitable purposes .
in addition to being a generous and socially conscious lady , johanna margretha eding was also quite clever and a tad bit megalomaniacal . the eter n al retur n of the same bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i need a pair just like that !
maybe the kind people at st. jacob 's will have something for me eding decided to provide underwear for needy ladies ad perpetuum .
in a stroke of legal genius , she made the church sign a contract according to which they would respect the terms of her lingerie action " as long as the sun shines and the wind blows . "
in other words , forever .
für immer .
para siempre .
no exceptions . " this is a lovely oddity of our tradition-rich church , " petters said . the case was taken to the courts twice , in 1920 and 1985 .
eding 's assets have long lost their value , but according to the terms of the settlement , the church nonetheless committed itself to providing 12 sets of ladies ' underwear of medium quality every year . " nothing cheapish , but also not the most expensive silk kind , " petters said . needy ladies looking for sexy g-strings will have to look elsewhere .
what they get here are cotton knickers of the bridget jones variety : half knickers , half parachutes , they are supposed to keep the ladies warm and not unnecessarily expose their derrieres .
-lrb- but that does n't mean they will have to become spinsters .
after all , the world learned an important lesson from bridget jones about the law of adverse underwear effect : the bigger and more embarrassing , the better .
action is always possible . -rrb- u n derwear ma n ia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to hamburg than you 'd think at first sight the church is luckily getting donations itself for its unique underwear project .

german defense minister franz josef jung said that germany had dropped its initial reluctance to lead the force . if agreed , germa n y will head the eu operatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung and steinmeier are confident that the mission will be approved " after 15 european nations agreed to take part in the mission , we are now willing to lead them from our operations control center in potsdam , " jung said .
" our french partners will be in command on the ground in kinshasa so that i 'm fully convinced that this partnership will guarantee a successful eu mission aimed at preserving peace during the elections . " in december , the united nations asked the european union to reinforce its 16,000-strong peacekeeping force to boost security a series of pivotal elections in the country .
the drc , which is still reeling from five years of civil war , has not had free democratic elections in over 40 years .

german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier told the german parliament that the eu had a vested interest in the country and the region as a whole . the eu has invested 800 million euros -lrb- $ 974 million -rrb- in the process of political transition towards democracy in the drc . " the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .

he says he has now changed his mind . " my talks with representatives in kinshasa have made me change my opinion , " he said .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair . " he added that the " opposition candidates deserve respect and admiration for participating " in the election to prove that there were many people in belarus who want democracy and human rights . the berlarussian opposition has called for the poll which returned lukashenko to power with a resounding 82.6 percent of the vote to be declared invalid because of alleged fraud . lukashenko on monday rejected the call as " absurd . " eu mulls sa n ctio n s eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner meanwhile said the bloc would " very likely " bolster sanctions on belarus .
the eu 's austrian presidency had earlier lamented a climate of intimidation clouding the elections in the former soviet republic . " from what we have seen so far my view is some action is now very likely indeed , " said ferrero-waldner , who has warned repeatedly in recent weeks that the eu could strengthen sanctions if it was not happy about the belarusian presidential election . speaking to reporters as eu foreign ministers discussed belarus at scheduled talks in brussels , she said there was unlikely to be any immediate decision , adding that the eu was waiting for a report by election monitors due later in the day . european commission vice president günter verheugen said that no one would believe the election which swept lukashenko to a third term in office was free and fair . verheuge n says n o place i n eu for a dictatorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen said no one would believe the elections were fair " no one will be fooled by this election result or indeed by the whole election , " verheugen told deutschlandradio kultur after it was announced that lukashenko had won sunday 's election with 82.6 percent of the vote . verheugen , a german , dismissed claims that belarus could aspire to membership of the european union . " this country is the last real dictatorship in europe and as long as it remains so it can not be a partner for the european union , " he said . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who chaired the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , told reporters : " the climate of intimidation and hindering of the opposition to do their work was upsetting . " pola n d proposes visa ba n s a n d freezi n g of fi n a n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland feels its neighbor has asserted strength to get the result it wanted poland 's deputy foreign minister , stanislaw komorowski was another of the foreign ministers in favor of sanctions . " we will propose the strengthening of sanctions , " he said .
" it is evident that belarus elections were not free and democratic .
the eu must act . " komorowski said he would propose a visa ban on belarus officials deemed responsible for election rigging if the offence could be proved .
he also said that a possible freeze on financial assets abroad and possibly wider targeted economic sanctions would also be put forward .
sanctions " must be constructed in such a way that they do not harm average people , " komorowski added . oppo n e n ts of sa n ctio n s fewer i n n umber however , not all the eu ministers were in favor of action against belarus . " there is no good reason to impose economic sanctions , " said czech foreign minister cyril svoboda .

" we will give further support to the democratic powers in the opposition , " government spokesman thomas steg told a press briefing . he cited chancellor angela merkel 's recent meetings with opposition figures as proof of this commitment . steg said the vote took place " in an atmosphere of reprisals and intimidation " , which meant that it " can not be considered free and fair . " he added that the " opposition candidates deserve respect and admiration for participating " in the election to prove that there were many people in belarus who want democracy and human rights . the berlarussian opposition has called for the poll which returned lukashenko to power with a resounding 82.6 percent of the vote to be declared invalid because of alleged fraud . lukashenko on monday rejected the call as " absurd .

german defense minister franz josef jung said that germany had dropped its initial reluctance to lead the force . if agreed , germa n y will head the eu operatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung and steinmeier are confident that the mission will be approved " after 15 european nations agreed to take part in the mission , we are now willing to lead them from our operations control center in potsdam , " jung said .
" our french partners will be in command on the ground in kinshasa so that i 'm fully convinced that this partnership will guarantee a successful eu mission aimed at preserving peace during the elections . " in december , the united nations asked the european union to reinforce its 16,000-strong peacekeeping force to boost security a series of pivotal elections in the country .
the drc , which is still reeling from five years of civil war , has not had free democratic elections in over 40 years .

german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier told the german parliament that the eu had a vested interest in the country and the region as a whole . the eu has invested 800 million euros -lrb- $ 974 million -rrb- in the process of political transition towards democracy in the drc . " the great lakes region has seen various attempts at stabilizing war-ravaged countries recently , " steinmeier said .
" we have to support them because developments in this region will have major repercussions for conflict resolution and peace building in the whole of africa . " any german participation , though , must first be approved by a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament .
the german government is confident that it will get parliamentary approval for the mission during a vote scheduled for early april . critics comi n g rou n d to eu 's role i n the co n go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu force would show the congolese that they are not forgotten but many deputies in the bundestag are still skeptical .

he says he has now changed his mind . " my talks with representatives in kinshasa have made me change my opinion , " he said .
" i now fully agree that the eu force is necessary to show to the local population that the international community is at their side .

both reiterated during the last week that they had not had any contact with enel . " we are living in the modern world , " said cirelli last thursday .
" there are telephones and if the enel management wants to get in touch with us we will take their call and listen to them . " enel chief fulvio conti for his part was set to meet kroes tuesday to outline his takeover plans . the eu commission has meanwhile been examining written explanations submitted by the french government of how the proposed suez-gdf merger evolved and is expected to give its opinion by the end of march . french economy and finance minister thierry breton , who met last monday in brussels with italian counterpart giulio tremonti , said there had previously been no negotiations between italy and france .

both reiterated during the last week that they had not had any contact with enel . " we are living in the modern world , " said cirelli last thursday .
" there are telephones and if the enel management wants to get in touch with us we will take their call and listen to them . " enel chief fulvio conti for his part was set to meet kroes tuesday to outline his takeover plans . the eu commission has meanwhile been examining written explanations submitted by the french government of how the proposed suez-gdf merger evolved and is expected to give its opinion by the end of march . french economy and finance minister thierry breton , who met last monday in brussels with italian counterpart giulio tremonti , said there had previously been no negotiations between italy and france .

generations of parents have nagged their teenagers to turn off the tv and find something better to do .
now , it seems , their children may be doing just that .
chatting with friends online - via services like msn and bebo - is beginning to take over from watching tv as the main hobby of many young people .
much of the chat is happening in so-called " closed community websites " .
unlike chatrooms , they 're not open to everyone : each person has to be invited to join in .
so , is online chat a good thing - and how safe are closed community websites ?
this morning on breakfast we found out about life online with pupils from one school at whitefield , greater manchester we discussed the spectacular rise of closed community websites with the chief executive of bebo , michael birch - and with a government internet safety advisor , dr rachel o 'connell and , we asked for your views read some of your e-mails to breakfast what not to do online never reveal name , address , phone number or password never reply to nasty or suggestive messages never open e-mail attachments unless they come from someone you trust never meet anyone unless an adult goes with you more online safety tips growing numbers of teenagers are spending hours at a time online , chatting to their friends .
msn is popular with many teenagers - but the fastest-growing service is bebo , launched only eight months ago .
it sets a minimum age of 13 for participants - and its website does contain safety advice - including a warning to be careful about divulging personal information and arranging to meet cyber friends offline .
parents and teachers worry that , however well-policed , online chat can be used for bullying , in exactly the same way as text messages .
some schools have also expressed concern over the amount of time teenagers spend online , instead of doing their homework .

the lord chancellor 's standing committee on the welsh language has made the recommendation .
it said bilingual juries were essential if equal status for both english and welsh - set out in the welsh language act - is to be given full effect .
but victim support campaigners warned it could lead to more trauma and stress for victims and witnesses .
the committee has made its recommendation as part of a consultation which is due to end this month .
it said the absence of a bilingual jury " severely undermines " the welsh language act guaranteeing the right of everyone taking part in a jury trial in wales to speak welsh .
it is achievable in other jurisdictions - i believe it is also achievable in the criminal courts of wales solicitor hywel james it also said jury trials in the crown court were currently out of step because in civil cases tried by a judge - and in criminal cases heard in the magistrates court or in crown court with no jury - arrangements could be made for the magistrate or judge to be bilingual .
any practical issues could also be overcome , it added .

he said : " i think you 're under a disability in wales if you wish to give evidence through the medium of welsh where that evidence is dependent on being translated and , in effect , the jury are receiving that second hand . "
we are concerned that selecting bilingual juries could cause extra delays in the court and result in more difficulties john trew , victim support wales mr james said there were practical difficulties to ensuring bilingual juries but they were not " insurmountable " .
he said the centralisation of crown court cases and also the demographic change of welsh speakers would ensure that there were sufficient numbers to form a panel of bilingual jurors .

it is achievable in other jurisdictions - i believe it is also achievable in the criminal courts of wales solicitor hywel james it also said jury trials in the crown court were currently out of step because in civil cases tried by a judge - and in criminal cases heard in the magistrates court or in crown court with no jury - arrangements could be made for the magistrate or judge to be bilingual .
any practical issues could also be overcome , it added .
solicitor hywel james welcomed the consultation .
he said : " i think you 're under a disability in wales if you wish to give evidence through the medium of welsh where that evidence is dependent on being translated and , in effect , the jury are receiving that second hand . "
we are concerned that selecting bilingual juries could cause extra delays in the court and result in more difficulties john trew , victim support wales mr james said there were practical difficulties to ensuring bilingual juries but they were not " insurmountable " .
he said the centralisation of crown court cases and also the demographic change of welsh speakers would ensure that there were sufficient numbers to form a panel of bilingual jurors .
" the census figures indicate that one-fifth of people in wales speak welsh .
" it is correct where the welsh language has equal status that they also have the right to bilingual juries .
" it is achievable in other jurisdictions .
i believe it is also achievable in the criminal courts of wales . "
but one organisation which took part in the consultation expressed its doubts .
john trew , national officer in wales for victim support wales , said : " we are concerned that selecting bilingual juries could cause extra delays in the court and result in more difficulties , more delays and more trauma and stress for victims and witnesses . "

kenneth farr , 37 , of penarth , died when the barrier at asda in cardiff bay smashed through his car windscreen and hit him on the head in may 2002 .
coroner mary hassell has told the jury to consider unlawful killing among its four possible verdicts .
she said she would accept a majority verdict .
the jury was sent out last week and resumed its deliberations on monday .
the inquest has heard how the car park barrier was difficult to close and was not locked into its securing post .
the coroner told them to consider four possible verdicts : unlawful killing , accidental death , a narrative verdict and an open verdict .
ms hassell said the standard of proof for an unlawful killing verdict had to be " beyond all reasonable doubt " .
she said that to reach this verdict : " you must decide that the behaviour was so bad as to amount to a criminal act or omission .
" the separate failure of a number of different people can not be added together to amount to gross negligence manslaughter . "
the padlock on the barrier was broken , the inquest heard mr farr was leaving the store with his three-year-old daughter when the accident happened .
the inquest was told the barrier at the exit to the car park had not been properly secured and witnesses reported seeing it swinging in the wind .
the court has heard about two similar incidents at other asda stores when barriers had struck cars , and in one case asda was fined for breaching health and safety regulations .
mr farr was pronounced dead in hospital after being struck by the barrier as he left the asda car park .
the manager in charge of the cardiff bay store told the inquest he thought the barrier was checked daily .
barriers removed dennis hughes said he took over as general store manager at asda a couple of months after the barrier was installed , and he believed it was the job of security to make sure it was safe .
mr hughes said he had never seen the barrier swinging free and had not received any complaints from customers about it .
he said he now would not want to work at a store with a barrier and had one removed when he transferred to a branch of asda in newport .
since the accident , all similar security barriers have been removed from asda car parks throughout the uk , the court has heard .

ms hassell said the standard of proof for an unlawful killing verdict had to be " beyond all reasonable doubt " .
she said that to reach this verdict : " you must decide that the behaviour was so bad as to amount to a criminal act or omission .
" the separate failure of a number of different people can not be added together to amount to gross negligence manslaughter . "
the padlock on the barrier was broken , the inquest heard mr farr was leaving the store with his three-year-old daughter when the accident happened .
the inquest was told the barrier at the exit to the car park had not been properly secured and witnesses reported seeing it swinging in the wind .
the court has heard about two similar incidents at other asda stores when barriers had struck cars , and in one case asda was fined for breaching health and safety regulations .
mr farr was pronounced dead in hospital after being struck by the barrier as he left the asda car park .
the manager in charge of the cardiff bay store told the inquest he thought the barrier was checked daily .
barriers removed dennis hughes said he took over as general store manager at asda a couple of months after the barrier was installed , and he believed it was the job of security to make sure it was safe .
mr hughes said he had never seen the barrier swinging free and had not received any complaints from customers about it .
he said he now would not want to work at a store with a barrier and had one removed when he transferred to a branch of asda in newport .
since the accident , all similar security barriers have been removed from asda car parks throughout the uk , the court has heard .

nobody was injured in the incident as operators were warned of the attack and evacuated the camp 's 200 residents .
the attack comes against a background of rising anger at western mining and energy interests in indonesia .
last week four security officers were killed in the province of papua by protesters demanding the closure of another gold mine owned by us giant freeport mcmoran .

bachchan , 63 , was operated on at a mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- hospital last november for diverticular disease - a condition caused by inflammation of the colon .
the star began shooting on a film ' kabhi alvida na kehna ' -lrb- never say goodbye -rrb- at a mumbai studio on monday .
bachchan , who has starred in over 100 films , has shown no sign of slowing down as he has got older .
the hero of more than 100 films was once dubbed the " most famous actor of the millennium " by a bbc news website readers ' poll .
bachchan will start filming three movies this week , after 12 productions worth over $ 20m were delayed after he took ill last year , say reports .
indefatigable " he was very excited this morning to come back to the set , " the star 's make-up man deepak sawant told the afp news agency .

across india , fans offered prayers to the actor 's speedy recovery .
the indefatigable bollywood icon had over 11 film releases last year - more than he has had during any of his 40 years in cinema .
bachchan is also india 's biggest television star , presenting a popular hour-long show modelled on the hugely popular game show , who wants to be a millionaire , on rupert murdoch 's star tv channel .
