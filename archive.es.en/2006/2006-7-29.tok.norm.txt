" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .
" we are even more burdened by our strength than by our weakness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet for einstein year 2005 : " it 's important to never stop asking questions " einstein immigrated to the united states in 1933 and took a professorship at princeton university in new jersey , where he died in 1955 at the age of 76 . the nobel prize winner was involved in quantum physics , geometrization and relativistic cosmology , but is most known for his theory of relativity .
it seems , however , that even such lofty scientific concepts are n't necessarily fulfilling . " soon i 'll be fed up with the -lrb- theory of -rrb- relativity , " he wrote on a postcard to elsa in 1921 .

she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .
" we are even more burdened by our strength than by our weakness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet for einstein year 2005 : " it 's important to never stop asking questions " einstein immigrated to the united states in 1933 and took a professorship at princeton university in new jersey , where he died in 1955 at the age of 76 . the nobel prize winner was involved in quantum physics , geometrization and relativistic cosmology , but is most known for his theory of relativity .
it seems , however , that even such lofty scientific concepts are n't necessarily fulfilling . " soon i 'll be fed up with the -lrb- theory of -rrb- relativity , " he wrote on a postcard to elsa in 1921 .
" even such a thing fades away when one is too involved in it . " dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wins robocup german robots dominated another sort of tournament over the weekend in germany : the robocup 2006 .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

-lrb- july 26 , 2006 -rrb- possible peacekeeping role in israel still divides germany the prospect of german troops participating in an international peacekeeping force in israel is deeply dividing the country .
now jewish groups have come out fiercely opposed to the idea .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes last year every sixth cigarette smuggled in germany last year , german customs officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes , most of which were counterfeit .
nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2006 high tobacco prices make illegal cigarettes appealing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pack says marlboro , but who knows what 's really inside cigarettes are expensive in germany .
one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes last year every sixth cigarette smuggled in germany last year , german customs officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes , most of which were counterfeit .
nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .

" people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans lost their homes in poland and the czech republic in may , 58 years after communist rulers confiscated it , the castle - one of the country 's biggest tourist money-spinners - was restored to its rightful owner , new york architect dominic von habsburg , the 68-year-old grandson of former queen marie of romania and son of the habsburg dynasty scion anton , archduke of austria . " it is with great emotion that i find myself again at this castle of my childhood , " habsburg told people at a ceremony in bran , recalling his flight nearly six decades earlier when his family was driven out by the communists .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes last year every sixth cigarette smuggled in germany last year , german customs officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes , most of which were counterfeit .
nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans lost their homes in poland and the czech republic in may , 58 years after communist rulers confiscated it , the castle - one of the country 's biggest tourist money-spinners - was restored to its rightful owner , new york architect dominic von habsburg , the 68-year-old grandson of former queen marie of romania and son of the habsburg dynasty scion anton , archduke of austria . " it is with great emotion that i find myself again at this castle of my childhood , " habsburg told people at a ceremony in bran , recalling his flight nearly six decades earlier when his family was driven out by the communists .
" i have never been back to romania since , till now . " some compe n satio n in neighboring bulgaria , former monarch simeon saxe-coburg , who fled his homeland as a child in 1946 after communists took over and who returned from exile five years ago to become prime minister from 2001 to 2005 , now lives in vrania palace in sofia . he is a beneficiary of a decision by the constitutional court in 1998 , allowing restitution of nationalized royal property . hungary , meanwhile , in 1991 became the first post-communist country in the region to pass laws on partial compensation for expropriated property , according to the state compensation agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artistocratic homes reverted to the state after they were almost detroyed in the war there were 817,811 claims submitted for compensation of property taken away during communism , and 58.5 billion forints -lrb- 207 million euros , $ 66 million -rrb- was paid out , followed by a second wave of pay-outs in 1994 . in the czech republic , argentinian-born frantisek oldrich kinsky has since 2003 been pressing around 150 separate legal demands for the return of his noble family 's estates and property , many of them cultural landmarks . but czech claimants also face complications .
cases involving aristocrats are often tangled up with controversial decrees passed in 1946 under which some three million ethnic germans were expelled from czechoslovakia and had their property seized . many blue-blooded dynasties who owned property here have german branches in their family trees . families frequently try to prove estates were wrongly confiscated because they were czechoslovak citizens , or that they opposed the country 's wartime nazi occupiers - which would make them exempt from the never-repealed decrees . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish nobles want property back former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .
" we are even more burdened by our strength than by our weakness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet for einstein year 2005 : " it 's important to never stop asking questions " einstein immigrated to the united states in 1933 and took a professorship at princeton university in new jersey , where he died in 1955 at the age of 76 . the nobel prize winner was involved in quantum physics , geometrization and relativistic cosmology , but is most known for his theory of relativity .
it seems , however , that even such lofty scientific concepts are n't necessarily fulfilling . " soon i 'll be fed up with the -lrb- theory of -rrb- relativity , " he wrote on a postcard to elsa in 1921 .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .

cases involving aristocrats are often tangled up with controversial decrees passed in 1946 under which some three million ethnic germans were expelled from czechoslovakia and had their property seized . many blue-blooded dynasties who owned property here have german branches in their family trees . families frequently try to prove estates were wrongly confiscated because they were czechoslovak citizens , or that they opposed the country 's wartime nazi occupiers - which would make them exempt from the never-repealed decrees . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish nobles want property back former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .

a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry .

" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .

he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .

nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .

" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .
-lrb- july 22 , 2006 -rrb- rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .
-lrb- july 26 , 2006 -rrb- possible peacekeeping role in israel still divides germany the prospect of german troops participating in an international peacekeeping force in israel is deeply dividing the country .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans lost their homes in poland and the czech republic in may , 58 years after communist rulers confiscated it , the castle - one of the country 's biggest tourist money-spinners - was restored to its rightful owner , new york architect dominic von habsburg , the 68-year-old grandson of former queen marie of romania and son of the habsburg dynasty scion anton , archduke of austria . " it is with great emotion that i find myself again at this castle of my childhood , " habsburg told people at a ceremony in bran , recalling his flight nearly six decades earlier when his family was driven out by the communists .
" i have never been back to romania since , till now . " some compe n satio n in neighboring bulgaria , former monarch simeon saxe-coburg , who fled his homeland as a child in 1946 after communists took over and who returned from exile five years ago to become prime minister from 2001 to 2005 , now lives in vrania palace in sofia . he is a beneficiary of a decision by the constitutional court in 1998 , allowing restitution of nationalized royal property . hungary , meanwhile , in 1991 became the first post-communist country in the region to pass laws on partial compensation for expropriated property , according to the state compensation agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artistocratic homes reverted to the state after they were almost detroyed in the war there were 817,811 claims submitted for compensation of property taken away during communism , and 58.5 billion forints -lrb- 207 million euros , $ 66 million -rrb- was paid out , followed by a second wave of pay-outs in 1994 . in the czech republic , argentinian-born frantisek oldrich kinsky has since 2003 been pressing around 150 separate legal demands for the return of his noble family 's estates and property , many of them cultural landmarks . but czech claimants also face complications .
cases involving aristocrats are often tangled up with controversial decrees passed in 1946 under which some three million ethnic germans were expelled from czechoslovakia and had their property seized . many blue-blooded dynasties who owned property here have german branches in their family trees . families frequently try to prove estates were wrongly confiscated because they were czechoslovak citizens , or that they opposed the country 's wartime nazi occupiers - which would make them exempt from the never-repealed decrees . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish nobles want property back former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.07.2006 merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the german military is already overextended german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon . in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , merkel said she saw other opportunities for germany to help out in the region , such as providing training for the police and military forces . the german leader said the capacity of the country 's armed forces , or bundeswehr , were " largely exhausted . " " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "

nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2006 high tobacco prices make illegal cigarettes appealing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pack says marlboro , but who knows what 's really inside cigarettes are expensive in germany .
one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said . " people say , ' why should property be returned to some count who lives in a palace , while we live in an apartment measuring 30 square meters -lrb- 320 square feet -rrb- , " ' he added . dracula 's castle the only way polish claimants can regain former belongings is to prove the communists seized property in violation of laws in force at the time , which allowed land holdings larger than 50 hectares -lrb- 125 acres -rrb- to be nationalized , szypowski said . " but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .
but some strike it lucky . one famous case is bran castle , a brooding fortress known popularly as dracula 's castle through association with the fictitious vampire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans lost their homes in poland and the czech republic in may , 58 years after communist rulers confiscated it , the castle - one of the country 's biggest tourist money-spinners - was restored to its rightful owner , new york architect dominic von habsburg , the 68-year-old grandson of former queen marie of romania and son of the habsburg dynasty scion anton , archduke of austria . " it is with great emotion that i find myself again at this castle of my childhood , " habsburg told people at a ceremony in bran , recalling his flight nearly six decades earlier when his family was driven out by the communists .
" i have never been back to romania since , till now . " some compe n satio n in neighboring bulgaria , former monarch simeon saxe-coburg , who fled his homeland as a child in 1946 after communists took over and who returned from exile five years ago to become prime minister from 2001 to 2005 , now lives in vrania palace in sofia . he is a beneficiary of a decision by the constitutional court in 1998 , allowing restitution of nationalized royal property . hungary , meanwhile , in 1991 became the first post-communist country in the region to pass laws on partial compensation for expropriated property , according to the state compensation agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artistocratic homes reverted to the state after they were almost detroyed in the war there were 817,811 claims submitted for compensation of property taken away during communism , and 58.5 billion forints -lrb- 207 million euros , $ 66 million -rrb- was paid out , followed by a second wave of pay-outs in 1994 . in the czech republic , argentinian-born frantisek oldrich kinsky has since 2003 been pressing around 150 separate legal demands for the return of his noble family 's estates and property , many of them cultural landmarks . but czech claimants also face complications .
cases involving aristocrats are often tangled up with controversial decrees passed in 1946 under which some three million ethnic germans were expelled from czechoslovakia and had their property seized . many blue-blooded dynasties who owned property here have german branches in their family trees . families frequently try to prove estates were wrongly confiscated because they were czechoslovak citizens , or that they opposed the country 's wartime nazi occupiers - which would make them exempt from the never-repealed decrees . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish nobles want property back former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .
but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation .

one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes last year every sixth cigarette smuggled in germany last year , german customs officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes , most of which were counterfeit .
nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .

" only when they have established a complete overview of the situation can a decision be made on what further measures to take , " schaar said in a statement , adding that all banking clients , regardless of their nationality or country of residence , have a right to know how their confidential information is handled . his spokesman added that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , had been asked to response by july 31 on what it knew about the program . financial services giant swift 's huge messaging system routes transactions worth about $ 6 trillion -lrb- 4.7 trillion euros -rrb- a day through the global banking system .

" " we are in congo , we provide the most troops in the balkans , and we have our largest contingent in afghanistan , " she said . " as germans , we should proceed in this region with utmost caution , " she added . while germany has not ruled out sending troops , officials insist that any talk of a contribution is premature until a un mandate for a multinational force is drawn up . in the newspaper interview merkel said besides germany helping train lebanese units , one of the most important areas was aiding in the " stabilization of the lebanese reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel says germany must take " utmost caution " in deciding on its actions in the middle east .
she also made clear that germany 's history gave it certain responsibilities . " it is a historical duty of german policy to strongly support the right of israel to exist , " she said .
" we have to be clear on the fact that the current crisis was sparked by hezbollah .
hezbollah has fired rockets at israel for months and kidnapped israeli soldiers . " divided opinion the question of german participation in an international peacekeeping contingent has been a controversial one in germany . jewish groups in germany have been fiercely opposed , but members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities .
up until now , merkel seemed to be keeping her options open . as recently as thursday , she told the daily der tagesspiegel : " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " but germany 's main jewish group has said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told german public radio last week . german politicians are divided on the question . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .

actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .
" we are even more burdened by our strength than by our weakness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet for einstein year 2005 : " it 's important to never stop asking questions " einstein immigrated to the united states in 1933 and took a professorship at princeton university in new jersey , where he died in 1955 at the age of 76 . the nobel prize winner was involved in quantum physics , geometrization and relativistic cosmology , but is most known for his theory of relativity .
it seems , however , that even such lofty scientific concepts are n't necessarily fulfilling . " soon i 'll be fed up with the -lrb- theory of -rrb- relativity , " he wrote on a postcard to elsa in 1921 .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .
the site was then acquired by the united states . according to szypowski , less than 40 percent of the polish public are in favor of re-privatizing nationalized property , down from 60 to 75 percent in the early 1990s . while claimants from prosperous middle class families find it tough to regain previous possessions , for aristocrats it 's even harder , szypowski said .

" but that 's difficult , " he said .
" there were not many such cases . " in romania , 90 percent of some 128,000 attempts at claiming back confiscated property have failed to produce results so far .

for many , the campaign ends in defeat . despite some notable successes , including the recent return of a romanian fortress known as dracula 's castle to a descendant of the habsburg dynasty that once ruled austria-hungary , aristocrats often see their ambitions to get ancestral property back thwarted by lengthy legal wrangling , vested interests or hostile public opinion . in poland , 16 years after the end of communism , blue-blooded claimants whom the state once regarded as class enemies are still waiting for a restitution law that would allow them to recover their ancestral fortunes . poland is the only post-communist country in the region that has not passed a restitution or compensation law to redress the " plunder perpetrated by the state on its citizens , " according to miroslaw szypowski , president of the polish union of property owners . but some aristocrats are not deterred . palace-tur n ed-embassy in early july , duke albert czetwertynski , his family and dozens of supporters staged an angry demonstration in front of the united states embassy in warsaw , demanding the return of a site they claim was stolen from them . the plot of land in the heart of the polish capital that now houses the embassy once boasted a 19th-century palace belonging to the czetwertynskis . it was torn down in the 1950s after the communist authorities arrested czetwertynski 's father , accused him of spying for america and confiscated his property .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2006 high tobacco prices make illegal cigarettes appealing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pack says marlboro , but who knows what 's really inside cigarettes are expensive in germany .
one pack costs four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , but more than three euros of that are taxes .
many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .
but market strollers wo n't see them out on display at the border-town market ; they have to ask the seller for them directly . original marlboros , for example , are sold here for 18 euros -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- per carton , but the buyer can usually negotiate down to 12 or even ten euros .
in germany , a carton of original marlboros costs a steep 40 euros -lrb- $ 51 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated goods at a market in a czech border town like the louis vuitton bags , these cigarettes are cheap remakes too .
a thorough comparison with a real pack of marlboros will even reveal mistakes on the health warning labels . it 's no wonder that the cigarette industry is in an uproar .
with tobacco tax hikes , tobacco bans and non-smoker protection ordinances , it has already got its back up against their wall . " you never know what 's in them , " said andrea winkhardt from the cigarette industry association , referring to the pirated cigarettes .
" that could include pesticides that may have been used at the tobacco plantation , for example . " bogus cigarettes more dangerous several independent studies have shown that phony cigarettes really are more dangerous than real ones because they may contain low-quality tobacco or even waste products . however , the cigarette industry is not just concerned about the health of its customers - it 's also got business on its mind .
fake cigarettes are n't sold only on the czech or polish border , they 're also smuggled into germany in large quantities , resulting in annual losses in the billions for the industry . " a smuggled cigarette , which no one pays tax on here , is one less cigarette that we have sold , " said winkhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cigarettes have paid their taxes the more expensive cigarettes become in germany , the more attractive smuggling and counterfeiting becomes , added winkhardt .
" the five tobacco-tax increases in four years have decreased our profits by one-third . " open borders for smugglers the fact that borders within the expanding european union are becoming more open only makes the fight against smuggling more difficult .
soon , the schengen treaty , which removes most border controls between participating eu countries , will also apply to the czech republic . franz paulus is a customs investigator in a mobile unit who , until just a few years ago , inspected trucks on the german-czech border .
he and his colleagues would drive civilian vehicles through the border areas and randomly search suspicious trucks . the sensitive noses of trained tobacco dogs , and sometimes portable x-ray machines , allowed the customers officers to undercover goods hidden throughout the trucks . " there were cigarettes here , too , " said paulus , pointing to an x-ray image .
" he had loaded aluminum scrap in the truck and if you looked from behind or on top , you could only see the aluminum scrap .
but he had loaded the cigarettes underneath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes last year every sixth cigarette smuggled in germany last year , german customs officers confiscated 735 million smuggled cigarettes , most of which were counterfeit .
nevertheless , the smugglers are still a step ahead of the investigators . the cigarette industry association estimates that every sixth cigarette smoked in germany has been smuggled in .
that denies cigarette companies sales income and the government tax revenue . german tourists meander through the outdoor market in cheb , plastic bags full of products in their hands .
many have already discovered the cigarettes there , but they do n't have to worry : buying them is not yet illegal . each person is allowed to take one carton back to germany for private consumption , regardless of whether the cigarettes inside are real or counterfeit . monika dittrich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gives in over eu tobacco advertising ban bowing to pressure coming from the european court of justice regarding the eu tobacco advertising directive , germany is planning to introduce its own bill that would outlaw the advertising of tobacco products .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .

many smokers feel pressed to get their hands on illegal cigarettes . at an outdoor market in the czech town of cheb , just past the czech-bavarian border , hundreds of wooden stands pedal top-name brands : t-shirts from adidas , sunglasses from prada and purses from louis vuitton for a nickel and a dime . none of what the young vietnamese stand owners sell is real . a quarter of the price while many people snatch up the fakes clothing and accessories , many others are interested in something with a slightly shorter life - cigarettes .

about 1,400 of albert einstein 's letters have recently been made available to the public .
they reveal the wild-haired scientist 's softer side - and his half dozen love affairs . " it 's true that m. followed me -lrb- to e n gla n d -rrb- a n d her chasi n g after me is getti n g out of co n trol . -lrb- … -rrb- of all the dames , i am i n fact attached o n ly to mrs. l. , who is absolutely harmless a n d dece n t a n d there is n o da n ger there to the divi n e world order . " an excerpt from a sappy romance novel ?
actually , it was albert einstein who wrote these words to his step-daughter margot in 1931 . about 1,400 of einstein 's letters , recently released by the hebrew university in jerusalem , offer new insight into the nobel prize winner 's gift for observation , his family relationships - and his not-so-secret love life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein and his first wife , mileva maric , were divorced in 1919 einstein had willed the german-language letters to margot , the daughter of his first wife mileva maric .
margot stipulated that they not be disclosed to the public until 20 years after her death .
she died on july 8 , 1986 . " einstein was a very complex person , " professor chanoch gutfreund of the hebrew university told german news agency dpa .
" it was often difficult for him to put his thoughts into words . " but he apparently faced up to the challenge - and left 3,500 hand-written pages behind .
the letters to his first wife mileva , their two sons , his step-daughter margot , and his second wife elsa loewenthal put an end to the misconceptions that the physicist had been cold and cruel to his family . the ma n behi n d the theory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein was often on the go , giving lectures in europe , the us and the middle east " we can see a much more human image than the sterile person presented 30 years ago in biographies , which presented him as a genius with no personal or sex life , " barbara wolff from the hebrew university einstein archives told afp . the newly released letters reveal that einstein not only had affairs with at least half a dozen women , he also wrote openly about them to his wives and children .
he referred to the women either with just their first names -lrb- estella , ethel , toni and margarita the " russia spy lover " -rrb- or with a first initial . wolff said the letters did n't shed new light on einstein 's science , but that " if the image we had of einstein before had three colors , now it has six . " no socks i n e n gla n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein , shown here with second wife elsa , had swiss , german and american passports at some point women were not his only topic of correspondence .
the scientist also admitted that he " did n't wear any socks " during a visit to oxford university , " even on the most festive occasions , but covered up this lack of civilization by wearing high-cut boots . " albert einstein was born in 1879 in ulm , germany , but spent much of his young life in switzerland .
in 1903 , he married mileva , with whom he had two sons .
they divorced in 1919 and he married his cousin elsa later that year . having returned to germany at the age of 35 , he renounced his german citizenship when hitler came to power in 1933 . from nazi germa n y to pri n ceto n u n iversity " one fears everywhere the competition of the expelled ' brainy ' jews , " wrote einstein at the very beginning of nazi rule .
" we are even more burdened by our strength than by our weakness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet for einstein year 2005 : " it 's important to never stop asking questions " einstein immigrated to the united states in 1933 and took a professorship at princeton university in new jersey , where he died in 1955 at the age of 76 . the nobel prize winner was involved in quantum physics , geometrization and relativistic cosmology , but is most known for his theory of relativity .
it seems , however , that even such lofty scientific concepts are n't necessarily fulfilling . " soon i 'll be fed up with the -lrb- theory of -rrb- relativity , " he wrote on a postcard to elsa in 1921 .
" even such a thing fades away when one is too involved in it . " dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wins robocup german robots dominated another sort of tournament over the weekend in germany : the robocup 2006 .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice returns to the region on saturday .
president bush said he would " work with the leaders of israel and lebanon to seize this opportunity to achieve lasting peace and stability for both of their countries " .
ms rice is expected to lobby for a un security council resolution that would lead to an international force being deployed in southern lebanon .
troop contributions uk prime minister tony blair , who met mr bush in washington on friday , said world leaders would discuss the deployment of a " stabilisation force " in lebanon at a meeting at the un headquarters in new york on monday .

there is something fundamentally wrong with the war , where there are more dead children than armed men , " mr egeland said .
he said he would ask the parties involved in the conflict " for at least a 72-hour start of this cessation of hostilities so that we can evacuate the wounded , children , the elderly , the disabled from the crossfire in southern lebanon " .
he said existing humanitarian corridors were not adequate to meet the immense needs of people in the war zone .

two people travelling in a german tv car were wounded .
refugees from rmeish said conditions were deteriorating rapidly in the area .
they said some of those still trapped in the village were drinking water from a stagnant pond .
a senior official at the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in lebanon told the bbc that supplies were " running out very , very fast " in southern lebanon .
" the south is definitely where the critical needs are at the moment .
you 've got active combat going on , several tens if not hundreds of thousands of persons displaced within the south , " arafat jamal said .
aid agencies also said that many people in the area were in urgent need of medical treatment .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice returns to the region on saturday .
president bush said he would " work with the leaders of israel and lebanon to seize this opportunity to achieve lasting peace and stability for both of their countries " .
ms rice is expected to lobby for a un security council resolution that would lead to an international force being deployed in southern lebanon .

he claimed in a bbc interview that he suspected two newspapers of paying the pair to follow him for " the best part of six months " .
but is this level of attention something a celebrity should expect ?
" it 's not the norm , but it 's happening more now than ever before " , says max clifford .
he is perhaps the uk 's best-known publicist , having spent his career setting up - and suppressing - stories involving figures in the public eye .
these days there were " more and more " paparazzi , he claimed , because " anybody who has access to a camera " could sell images to the press .
if you 're craving it and always trying to get it , you ca n't complain if they 're following you around publicist max clifford -lrb- second left -rrb- on fame he says he felt sorry for the former wham ! singer because " he 's far more sinned-against than sinner " .
" it 's been many , many years since he played the paparazzi pr game " , clifford says .
he has far more sympathy for george michael than for the beckhams because victoria beckham is " always using and working the publicity machine " , he adds .
' it 's a pain ' but while michael says he " should not have to worry about who 's watching me at 2.30 in the morning " , actor colin farrell says he accepts the attention he receives as a celebrity .
" yes , it 's a pain , and have i ever wanted to punch a paparazzi ?
sure .
but the pros outweigh the cons , " he told the bbc news website .
however , although some stars complain about being photographed illicitly , they are not necessarily blameless , according to one leading editor .
" some celebrities are in on the game and are taking half the money for these paparazzi shots , " claims jane ennis of british magazine now .
michael denied recent news stories had caused a rift with his partner " there are some celebrities who are in devils ' deals because they know the shots will fetch a lot of money - so they 're on holiday and they take their tops off .
" the paparazzi photographer takes the shots from some distance away and the two of them share the money . "
some celebrities do this to maintain their profiles , ennis says , although she stresses this was not the case for michael .
" some of them have n't done anything of any talent or ability for years , " she says .
" they 're kept alive by behaving outrageously , getting photographed and those shots appearing in the papers . "
accidents moves have been taken to protect people in california from paparazzi who are felt to have overstepped the mark .
photographers who commit assault while chasing celebrities face large fines under laws introduced by the state 's governor - and former film star - arnold schwarzenegger .
in the past 18 months , there have been several accidents involving celebrities who were being followed by photographers .
the public are more interested in the reality of people 's lives and the unofficial take on their lives jane ennis , now magazine actress lindsay lohan was cut and bruised after a photographer 's van collided with her car , although he was cleared of any charges .
lost in translation star scarlett johansson had a minor crash while allegedly being followed by paparazzi .
oscar-winner reese witherspoon claimed she was once chased by photographers who were trying to force her from the road .
and singer britney spears was reported as saying her fear of " reckless " paparazzi prevented her from taking her baby son out in public .
' deeply saddened ' perhaps the most famous case of all was the death of diana , princess of wales in 1997 .
three photographers were convicted of breaching french privacy laws for taking pictures of her on the night she was killed in a car crash in paris .
earlier this month , princes william and harry said they were " deeply saddened " that italian magazine chi had printed a photo of their mother as she lay dying .
however , there seems little chance that demand for such " off-guard " photographs will decline .
" the public are more interested in the reality of people 's lives and the unofficial take on their lives than they are in the stuff that celebrities and their publicists like to feed out , " says ennis , whose magazine sells almost 600,000 copies per week .
and clifford added that stars who sought publicity could not protest about the paparazzi .
" if you 're craving it and always trying to get it , you ca n't complain if they 're following you around , " he said .

a company has launched a veterinary drug to replace diclofenac , whose residues accumulate in dead livestock and kill vultures at an alarming rate .
vultures are a vital part of the ecology in south asia .
the scavenging birds ' rapid and efficient consumption of animal carcasses has traditionally prevented the spread of disease .
but in the past 10 years the numbers of three local vulture species have declined by more than 90 % .
main culprit they are now threatened with total extinction .
two years ago , researchers working in pakistan discovered that diclofenac , an anti-inflammatory drug used in livestock , was poisoning and killing vultures .
now nepal 's largest veterinary pharmaceutical company has introduced a new drug containing meloxicam , which will treat livestock effectively but also be safe for scavenging birds .
a senior government official said that in due course this new drug , marketed as melox , would completely replace diclofenac .
the government recently said it would stop the latter production and importation of diclofenac .

with its sleek cars , mtv aesthetic and cutting-edge fashions , the miami vice tv series was the epitome of ' 80s cool .
thanks to actors don johnson and philip michael thomas , rolled-up sleeves , ray-ban shades and shoes without socks became synonymous with that glitzy decade .
as soon as those famous flamingos appeared on screen to the strains of jan hammer 's synthesiser-heavy theme tune , fans knew they were in for glossy entertainment more akin to a pop video than a conventional cop drama .
surprisingly , though , creator michael mann chose to steer clear of the show 's celebrated iconography when he came to make a film version for a 21st century audience .
" we did n't want to remake what we made in 1984 , " he said in london on friday .
" the exciting thing for me was to locate this in 2006 . "
' cool and sexy ' actor jamie foxx , who takes on thomas ' role as detective ricardo " rico " tubbs , admits the original show left a lasting impression .
" america moves a lot slower than what you see on tv , so when you saw those guys handling guns and looking good it was hot , " he said .
" the music , the women , the cars , the clothes - it defined what being cool and sexy was . "
for mann , however , the intention was to take what worked in the original and " plant it in the present " .
" for me it was miami vice for real , and for right now .
that 's what made it intriguing . "
another key factor , the director continues , was the additional authenticity that could be brought to the on-screen violence .
" as an r-rated feature , we can explore some of the things we could n't in television . "
' glum and glummer ' however , while the film contains graphic mayhem and an extended shoot-out , mann says he was keen to ensure the bloodshed was not gratuitous .
" an action scene only has legitimacy if it 's completely dramatic .
i try to make it as real and believable as i can . "
" it ca n't just be one action scene after another , " agrees colin farrell , who steps into johnson 's shoes as detective ' sonny ' crockett .
" they have to be emotionally connected . "
so far , though , not everyone has been won over by the film 's serious tone and marked absence of humour .
" mann 's update of his classic series is a glum and glummer proposition , " writes the hollywood reporter 's critic .
industry newspaper variety , meanwhile , asks whether " young guys who were infants when the show expired in 1989 will queue up " for the remake .
feeling trepidation irish actor farrell admits feeling trepidation over how the film will fare at the box office .
" i 'd be a liar if i said i was n't nervous , " he told reporters .
" a lot of people invested their energy and time in this movie , so you want people to see it .
" i 've had films before where people have n't gone to see them , and it hurts . "
" you want everyone to check it out and be successful , " adds foxx .
" that 's what this business is about . "
the pirates of the caribbean sequel apart , several of this summer 's major releases have underperformed - and some pundits have predicted miami vice , which cost a reported $ 125m -lrb- £ 67m -rrb- to produce , may follow suit .
with this in mind , how did mann feel when actor samuel l jackson arrived at his film 's european premiere on thursday wearing a t-shirt promoting his own action thriller , snakes on a plane ?
" it 's all in good spirit , " he told the bbc news website with a smile .
" we all want each other 's movies to do well . "
