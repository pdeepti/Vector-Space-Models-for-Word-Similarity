since taking the job of the german national soccer team coach in august 2004 , he has been commuting between his native country and his home in southern california . now he has said that he will stay in germany for the most part until the start of the world cup on june 9 . " the centre of my life is in germany .
i knew my work and my plans were always going to be in germany in the last months before the world cup , " said klinsmann on his arrival . " i will still fly to my family in california now and again , " he said in a statement on the germany football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- web site . with just 88 days to go to the beginning of the show piece event , due to kick-off on june 9 , germany are sweating over the national team 's ability to avoid an embarrassment on home soil . missed workshop the former germany striker , under scrutiny since a 4-1friendly defeat by italy on march 1 , had been scolded by franz beckenbauer for missing a two-day world cup workshop in düsseldorf , which ended on tuesday . klinsmann said in sunday 's statement that the reasons for his missing the workshop were personal . " that week was just a year after the death of my father and i had promised my mother long ago that we would spend that hard time for her together in california . " klinsmann arrived in germany from california on sunday and was scheduled to attend a bundesliga game between schalke 04 and eintracht frankfurt later in the day .
he was planning to stay in the country at least until a friendly match against the united states on march 22 in dortmund . pressure mounting german soccer officials had turned up the pressure on klinsmann over the past few days , saying he should spend more time in germany . " klinsmann needs to be closer more often to the national side .
he needs to be present in germany .
i have the right to expect that , " said dfb co-president theo zwanziger .
he is also due to meet with the national coach to try to convince klinsmann of the need for the team to be more accessible to the fans to create a positive atmosphere in the country before the finals . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi critics offer grudging support but effe wants the sack germany coach jürgen klinsmann got some much-needed support this week but it was tempered by harsh words from ex-colleague stefan effenberg who called for his head and for former bayern boss ottmar hitzfeld to take over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

" ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

" ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing . " in the letter he wrote about a medical report that he got that showed that there were strong drugs in his system only used for treating leprosy or tuberculosis , " said tomanovic . milosevic was found dead in his prison bed saturday at the tribunal in the hague , where he was being judged for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity over the 1990s balkan wars that killed more than 200,000 people . hardcore loyalists to the man branded the " butcher of the balkans " accused the un court of responsibility for his death , some even laying accusations of murder by poisoning . suicide not ruled out chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte dismissed such allegations as " rumors " and said she could not rule out the possibility that the 64-year-old had committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte , prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia " we must now wait for the results of the autopsy to see the cause of death but we have no choice -lrb- but -rrb- between a normal natural death and suicide , " she told a news conference . last month , the judges denied a request from milosevic to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague .
milosevic suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems . autopsy on sunday an autopsy started in the afternoon in a dutch forensic institute and was expected to last several hours , un war tribunal spokesman christian chartier told afp .
" it is unlikely that the results will be known today -lrb- sunday -rrb- , " he added . a toxicological examination of the body was also being conducted . fausto pocar , president of the un war crimes tribunal , said the autopsy , also attended by serbian government medical experts , was required by dutch law to establish cause of death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic in the court room milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges for the 1992-95 bosnian conflict , notably the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys - the biggest single atrocity in europe since world war ii . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who had admitted crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . del ponte said it was " a great pity for justice " that milosevic died before a verdict could be given in his trial . she said it was now more urgent than ever to arrest other most wanted war crimes fugitives : former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic and the wartime political leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic . survivors of the srebrenica massacre said milosevic had cheated justice but serbian newspapers lashed out at the tribunal itself , accusing it of murder . " the hague killed milosevic , " blared the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large portrait pictures . supporters pay tribute dozens of hardcore supporters queued to pay tribute in front of his party seat in central belgrade , where a large photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid on a table in the entrance hall .

" heroes never die " and " we love you , " read the captions . milosevic 's family were divided over where he should be laid to rest , with his wife mira - herself a former powerful political figure , but now facing an arrest warrant if she returns to serbia - reportedly wanting burial in russia where she now lives . brother borislav and daughter marija said he should be buried in belgrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .
long-term strategy furthermore , the tourist board is thinking long term - not just about the cheering fans filling up the stadiums , but also the 40 million television viewers worldwide .
" the world cup is a global media event these days .
it is a tremendous opportunity to attract foreign tourists to germany " , said hedorfer .
" we have planned an entire arts and cultural program around the games " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the cologne cathedral - a popular tourist landmark there 's more to german hospitality , and its culinary tradition for that matter , than sauerkraut .
the brandenburg gate , the cologne cathedral and other historical sights , as well as plump , curried sausages and regional specialties such as swabian spätzle , for example , will be featured in advertising campaigns aimed at promoting a friendly , service-oriented country .
financing the event no need for state subsidies to finance this massive event .
the world cup , which takes place every four years , beats even the olympic games in terms of private sources of income .
" we are able to finance the world cup through corporate sponsorships , international broadcasting rights and , of course , ticket sales .
now we 've added hospitality services , such as gourmet dishes for vip guests " , said andreas herren , spokesman for fifa , the international soccer federation .
proceeds from sales of tickets and hospitality services will benefit fifa 's organizational committee in germany , which is responsible for building projects and infrastructure , as well as a vast palate of cultural offerings and the smooth running of the 64 tournament games .
seventy percent of the income generated from television rights and sponsorships will be distributed among the 207 regional federations worldwide .
gigantic viewing screens germans are also eager to avoid a problem that cropped up at the last world cup hosted by both korea and japan in 2002 - empty seats in the stadiums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fans celebrate victory over south korea in 2002 world cup " we can sell 2.9 million tickets , and the goal of fifa is to make sure that every possible seat is filled .
when there are tickets that sponsors have been allotted , but no longer need , we want to be able to recirculate them to the public " , said herren .
even for soccer fans who are not in ticketholders , there will be gigantic screens set up for public viewing in major cities , including all the venues where the games will be played .
it is hoped that the viewing areas will create a festive mood among soccer fans , although some are worried about the potential for violence in these crowded areas .
commercial possibilities the area between the german parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery in the political heart of berlin , could easily become a kind of mini-soccer city .
adidas , the german sports apparel producer , wants to set up shop there . adidas and other companies hope to take advantage of the confluence of sports fans and the overall good mood .
" with 64 games overall , and 100,000 spectators for each and every game , we will reach millions on a scale of incredible magnitude , " said fifa 's herren .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder .

an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday .

some called him a " bastard " for whom death was too kind , while others wept at the loss of national " martyr .

" the hague killed milosevic , " said the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large pictures of the former serbian strongman . " murdered , " said kurir , another of the balkan state 's lurid dailies , basing its story on an interview with a serbian doctor who had examined milosevic in november . europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region , still riven by nationalist tendencies and the legacy of the milosevic years . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . but there were also fears that milosevic 's death could boost nationalist forces , which remain powerful in serbia and the serb-run part of bosnia .
his funeral , if held in serbia , could also be a rallying point for nationalist hardliners who control the largest party in the serbian parliament . milosevic 's brother called sunday for the former yugoslav president to be buried in belgrade , but said no decision had been taken yet .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's legal advisor claims the former president was the target of an attempted poisoning zdenko tomanovic , a legal adviser of milosevic , said the former yugoslav president claimed to have been the target of an attempted poisoning . the icty said a toxicological examination of the body would also be carried out on sunday .
an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday . " however , the crimes for which he was accused , including genocide , can not be left unpunished , " she added , referring to fugitive genocide suspects , bosnian serbs radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , to be captured and sent to the hague . serbian reaction on the streets of belgrade , serbs reacted with a mixture of shock , anger and deep suspicion .
some called him a " bastard " for whom death was too kind , while others wept at the loss of national " martyr . " serbia 's media focused sunday on the un court 's perceived culpability in his death . " the hague killed milosevic , " said the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large pictures of the former serbian strongman . " murdered , " said kurir , another of the balkan state 's lurid dailies , basing its story on an interview with a serbian doctor who had examined milosevic in november . europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region , still riven by nationalist tendencies and the legacy of the milosevic years . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . but there were also fears that milosevic 's death could boost nationalist forces , which remain powerful in serbia and the serb-run part of bosnia .
his funeral , if held in serbia , could also be a rallying point for nationalist hardliners who control the largest party in the serbian parliament . milosevic 's brother called sunday for the former yugoslav president to be buried in belgrade , but said no decision had been taken yet . " it has not been decided .
his family - his wife and son - are taking the decision , " borislav milosevic told afp in moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the charges against slobodan milosevic former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who was found dead saturday in his cell at the un detention unit near the hague , had been on trial before the un war crimes court since february 2002 .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's legal advisor claims the former president was the target of an attempted poisoning zdenko tomanovic , a legal adviser of milosevic , said the former yugoslav president claimed to have been the target of an attempted poisoning . the icty said a toxicological examination of the body would also be carried out on sunday .
an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday . " however , the crimes for which he was accused , including genocide , can not be left unpunished , " she added , referring to fugitive genocide suspects , bosnian serbs radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , to be captured and sent to the hague . serbian reaction on the streets of belgrade , serbs reacted with a mixture of shock , anger and deep suspicion .
some called him a " bastard " for whom death was too kind , while others wept at the loss of national " martyr . " serbia 's media focused sunday on the un court 's perceived culpability in his death . " the hague killed milosevic , " said the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large pictures of the former serbian strongman . " murdered , " said kurir , another of the balkan state 's lurid dailies , basing its story on an interview with a serbian doctor who had examined milosevic in november . europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region , still riven by nationalist tendencies and the legacy of the milosevic years . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . but there were also fears that milosevic 's death could boost nationalist forces , which remain powerful in serbia and the serb-run part of bosnia .
his funeral , if held in serbia , could also be a rallying point for nationalist hardliners who control the largest party in the serbian parliament . milosevic 's brother called sunday for the former yugoslav president to be buried in belgrade , but said no decision had been taken yet . " it has not been decided .
his family - his wife and son - are taking the decision , " borislav milosevic told afp in moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the charges against slobodan milosevic former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who was found dead saturday in his cell at the un detention unit near the hague , had been on trial before the un war crimes court since february 2002 .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .
long-term strategy furthermore , the tourist board is thinking long term - not just about the cheering fans filling up the stadiums , but also the 40 million television viewers worldwide .
" the world cup is a global media event these days .
it is a tremendous opportunity to attract foreign tourists to germany " , said hedorfer .

the world cup , which takes place every four years , beats even the olympic games in terms of private sources of income .
" we are able to finance the world cup through corporate sponsorships , international broadcasting rights and , of course , ticket sales .
now we 've added hospitality services , such as gourmet dishes for vip guests " , said andreas herren , spokesman for fifa , the international soccer federation .
proceeds from sales of tickets and hospitality services will benefit fifa 's organizational committee in germany , which is responsible for building projects and infrastructure , as well as a vast palate of cultural offerings and the smooth running of the 64 tournament games .
seventy percent of the income generated from television rights and sponsorships will be distributed among the 207 regional federations worldwide .

even for soccer fans who are not in ticketholders , there will be gigantic screens set up for public viewing in major cities , including all the venues where the games will be played .
it is hoped that the viewing areas will create a festive mood among soccer fans , although some are worried about the potential for violence in these crowded areas .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic 's legal advisor claims the former president was the target of an attempted poisoning zdenko tomanovic , a legal adviser of milosevic , said the former yugoslav president claimed to have been the target of an attempted poisoning . the icty said a toxicological examination of the body would also be carried out on sunday .
an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday . " however , the crimes for which he was accused , including genocide , can not be left unpunished , " she added , referring to fugitive genocide suspects , bosnian serbs radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , to be captured and sent to the hague . serbian reaction on the streets of belgrade , serbs reacted with a mixture of shock , anger and deep suspicion .
some called him a " bastard " for whom death was too kind , while others wept at the loss of national " martyr . " serbia 's media focused sunday on the un court 's perceived culpability in his death . " the hague killed milosevic , " said the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large pictures of the former serbian strongman . " murdered , " said kurir , another of the balkan state 's lurid dailies , basing its story on an interview with a serbian doctor who had examined milosevic in november . europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region , still riven by nationalist tendencies and the legacy of the milosevic years . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . but there were also fears that milosevic 's death could boost nationalist forces , which remain powerful in serbia and the serb-run part of bosnia .
his funeral , if held in serbia , could also be a rallying point for nationalist hardliners who control the largest party in the serbian parliament . milosevic 's brother called sunday for the former yugoslav president to be buried in belgrade , but said no decision had been taken yet . " it has not been decided .
his family - his wife and son - are taking the decision , " borislav milosevic told afp in moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the charges against slobodan milosevic former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who was found dead saturday in his cell at the un detention unit near the hague , had been on trial before the un war crimes court since february 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .

but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .

and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .

since taking the job of the german national soccer team coach in august 2004 , he has been commuting between his native country and his home in southern california . now he has said that he will stay in germany for the most part until the start of the world cup on june 9 . " the centre of my life is in germany .

he was planning to stay in the country at least until a friendly match against the united states on march 22 in dortmund . pressure mounting german soccer officials had turned up the pressure on klinsmann over the past few days , saying he should spend more time in germany . " klinsmann needs to be closer more often to the national side .
he needs to be present in germany .
i have the right to expect that , " said dfb co-president theo zwanziger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .

and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .

" ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing . " in the letter he wrote about a medical report that he got that showed that there were strong drugs in his system only used for treating leprosy or tuberculosis , " said tomanovic . milosevic was found dead in his prison bed saturday at the tribunal in the hague , where he was being judged for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity over the 1990s balkan wars that killed more than 200,000 people . hardcore loyalists to the man branded the " butcher of the balkans " accused the un court of responsibility for his death , some even laying accusations of murder by poisoning . suicide not ruled out chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte dismissed such allegations as " rumors " and said she could not rule out the possibility that the 64-year-old had committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte , prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia " we must now wait for the results of the autopsy to see the cause of death but we have no choice -lrb- but -rrb- between a normal natural death and suicide , " she told a news conference . last month , the judges denied a request from milosevic to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague .

he also faced genocide charges for the 1992-95 bosnian conflict , notably the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys - the biggest single atrocity in europe since world war ii . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who had admitted crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . del ponte said it was " a great pity for justice " that milosevic died before a verdict could be given in his trial . she said it was now more urgent than ever to arrest other most wanted war crimes fugitives : former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic and the wartime political leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic . survivors of the srebrenica massacre said milosevic had cheated justice but serbian newspapers lashed out at the tribunal itself , accusing it of murder . " the hague killed milosevic , " blared the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large portrait pictures . supporters pay tribute dozens of hardcore supporters queued to pay tribute in front of his party seat in central belgrade , where a large photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid on a table in the entrance hall . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . milosevic " did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " said senior party official ivica dacic , describing his death as an " irreparable loss " to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic elsewhere in belgrade , his death added a haunting poignancy to a ceremony marking the slaying three years ago of zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , the reformist serbian prime minister who had sent him to face justice . in bijeljina , in the bosnian serb entity republika srpksa , candles were lit near a monument where posters of milosevic were plastered .
" heroes never die " and " we love you , " read the captions . milosevic 's family were divided over where he should be laid to rest , with his wife mira - herself a former powerful political figure , but now facing an arrest warrant if she returns to serbia - reportedly wanting burial in russia where she now lives . brother borislav and daughter marija said he should be buried in belgrade .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder .

an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .
long-term strategy furthermore , the tourist board is thinking long term - not just about the cheering fans filling up the stadiums , but also the 40 million television viewers worldwide .
" the world cup is a global media event these days .
it is a tremendous opportunity to attract foreign tourists to germany " , said hedorfer .
" we have planned an entire arts and cultural program around the games " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the cologne cathedral - a popular tourist landmark there 's more to german hospitality , and its culinary tradition for that matter , than sauerkraut .
the brandenburg gate , the cologne cathedral and other historical sights , as well as plump , curried sausages and regional specialties such as swabian spätzle , for example , will be featured in advertising campaigns aimed at promoting a friendly , service-oriented country .
financing the event no need for state subsidies to finance this massive event .
the world cup , which takes place every four years , beats even the olympic games in terms of private sources of income .
" we are able to finance the world cup through corporate sponsorships , international broadcasting rights and , of course , ticket sales .
now we 've added hospitality services , such as gourmet dishes for vip guests " , said andreas herren , spokesman for fifa , the international soccer federation .
proceeds from sales of tickets and hospitality services will benefit fifa 's organizational committee in germany , which is responsible for building projects and infrastructure , as well as a vast palate of cultural offerings and the smooth running of the 64 tournament games .
seventy percent of the income generated from television rights and sponsorships will be distributed among the 207 regional federations worldwide .
gigantic viewing screens germans are also eager to avoid a problem that cropped up at the last world cup hosted by both korea and japan in 2002 - empty seats in the stadiums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fans celebrate victory over south korea in 2002 world cup " we can sell 2.9 million tickets , and the goal of fifa is to make sure that every possible seat is filled .
when there are tickets that sponsors have been allotted , but no longer need , we want to be able to recirculate them to the public " , said herren .
even for soccer fans who are not in ticketholders , there will be gigantic screens set up for public viewing in major cities , including all the venues where the games will be played .
it is hoped that the viewing areas will create a festive mood among soccer fans , although some are worried about the potential for violence in these crowded areas .
commercial possibilities the area between the german parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery in the political heart of berlin , could easily become a kind of mini-soccer city .
adidas , the german sports apparel producer , wants to set up shop there . adidas and other companies hope to take advantage of the confluence of sports fans and the overall good mood .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing . " in the letter he wrote about a medical report that he got that showed that there were strong drugs in his system only used for treating leprosy or tuberculosis , " said tomanovic . milosevic was found dead in his prison bed saturday at the tribunal in the hague , where he was being judged for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity over the 1990s balkan wars that killed more than 200,000 people . hardcore loyalists to the man branded the " butcher of the balkans " accused the un court of responsibility for his death , some even laying accusations of murder by poisoning . suicide not ruled out chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte dismissed such allegations as " rumors " and said she could not rule out the possibility that the 64-year-old had committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte , prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia " we must now wait for the results of the autopsy to see the cause of death but we have no choice -lrb- but -rrb- between a normal natural death and suicide , " she told a news conference . last month , the judges denied a request from milosevic to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague .
milosevic suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems . autopsy on sunday an autopsy started in the afternoon in a dutch forensic institute and was expected to last several hours , un war tribunal spokesman christian chartier told afp .
" it is unlikely that the results will be known today -lrb- sunday -rrb- , " he added . a toxicological examination of the body was also being conducted . fausto pocar , president of the un war crimes tribunal , said the autopsy , also attended by serbian government medical experts , was required by dutch law to establish cause of death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic in the court room milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges for the 1992-95 bosnian conflict , notably the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys - the biggest single atrocity in europe since world war ii . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who had admitted crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . del ponte said it was " a great pity for justice " that milosevic died before a verdict could be given in his trial . she said it was now more urgent than ever to arrest other most wanted war crimes fugitives : former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic and the wartime political leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic . survivors of the srebrenica massacre said milosevic had cheated justice but serbian newspapers lashed out at the tribunal itself , accusing it of murder . " the hague killed milosevic , " blared the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large portrait pictures . supporters pay tribute dozens of hardcore supporters queued to pay tribute in front of his party seat in central belgrade , where a large photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid on a table in the entrance hall . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . milosevic " did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " said senior party official ivica dacic , describing his death as an " irreparable loss " to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic elsewhere in belgrade , his death added a haunting poignancy to a ceremony marking the slaying three years ago of zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , the reformist serbian prime minister who had sent him to face justice . in bijeljina , in the bosnian serb entity republika srpksa , candles were lit near a monument where posters of milosevic were plastered .
" heroes never die " and " we love you , " read the captions . milosevic 's family were divided over where he should be laid to rest , with his wife mira - herself a former powerful political figure , but now facing an arrest warrant if she returns to serbia - reportedly wanting burial in russia where she now lives . brother borislav and daughter marija said he should be buried in belgrade . " it has not been decided .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .
long-term strategy furthermore , the tourist board is thinking long term - not just about the cheering fans filling up the stadiums , but also the 40 million television viewers worldwide .
" the world cup is a global media event these days .
it is a tremendous opportunity to attract foreign tourists to germany " , said hedorfer .
" we have planned an entire arts and cultural program around the games " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the cologne cathedral - a popular tourist landmark there 's more to german hospitality , and its culinary tradition for that matter , than sauerkraut .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder .

an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday . " however , the crimes for which he was accused , including genocide , can not be left unpunished , " she added , referring to fugitive genocide suspects , bosnian serbs radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , to be captured and sent to the hague . serbian reaction on the streets of belgrade , serbs reacted with a mixture of shock , anger and deep suspicion .
some called him a " bastard " for whom death was too kind , while others wept at the loss of national " martyr . " serbia 's media focused sunday on the un court 's perceived culpability in his death . " the hague killed milosevic , " said the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large pictures of the former serbian strongman . " murdered , " said kurir , another of the balkan state 's lurid dailies , basing its story on an interview with a serbian doctor who had examined milosevic in november . europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region , still riven by nationalist tendencies and the legacy of the milosevic years . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . but there were also fears that milosevic 's death could boost nationalist forces , which remain powerful in serbia and the serb-run part of bosnia .
his funeral , if held in serbia , could also be a rallying point for nationalist hardliners who control the largest party in the serbian parliament . milosevic 's brother called sunday for the former yugoslav president to be buried in belgrade , but said no decision had been taken yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

so when germany was chosen as the 2006 host nation to the biggest and most popular sporting event of all time - the soccer world cup - the tourism industry was jubilant .
one million visitors from around the globe are expected for the games , which will be held in various cities and last for a month starting june 9 .
during that time , the german national tourist board anticipates a need for 4.8 to 5.5 million additional hotel rooms .
" the world cup will boost the domestic economy by about 9 or 10 billion euros " , says the tourist board ´ s managing director , petra hedorfer .
long-term strategy furthermore , the tourist board is thinking long term - not just about the cheering fans filling up the stadiums , but also the 40 million television viewers worldwide .
" the world cup is a global media event these days .
it is a tremendous opportunity to attract foreign tourists to germany " , said hedorfer .
" we have planned an entire arts and cultural program around the games " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the cologne cathedral - a popular tourist landmark there 's more to german hospitality , and its culinary tradition for that matter , than sauerkraut .
the brandenburg gate , the cologne cathedral and other historical sights , as well as plump , curried sausages and regional specialties such as swabian spätzle , for example , will be featured in advertising campaigns aimed at promoting a friendly , service-oriented country .
financing the event no need for state subsidies to finance this massive event .
the world cup , which takes place every four years , beats even the olympic games in terms of private sources of income .
" we are able to finance the world cup through corporate sponsorships , international broadcasting rights and , of course , ticket sales .
now we 've added hospitality services , such as gourmet dishes for vip guests " , said andreas herren , spokesman for fifa , the international soccer federation .
proceeds from sales of tickets and hospitality services will benefit fifa 's organizational committee in germany , which is responsible for building projects and infrastructure , as well as a vast palate of cultural offerings and the smooth running of the 64 tournament games .
seventy percent of the income generated from television rights and sponsorships will be distributed among the 207 regional federations worldwide .
gigantic viewing screens germans are also eager to avoid a problem that cropped up at the last world cup hosted by both korea and japan in 2002 - empty seats in the stadiums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fans celebrate victory over south korea in 2002 world cup " we can sell 2.9 million tickets , and the goal of fifa is to make sure that every possible seat is filled .
when there are tickets that sponsors have been allotted , but no longer need , we want to be able to recirculate them to the public " , said herren .
even for soccer fans who are not in ticketholders , there will be gigantic screens set up for public viewing in major cities , including all the venues where the games will be played .
it is hoped that the viewing areas will create a festive mood among soccer fans , although some are worried about the potential for violence in these crowded areas .
commercial possibilities the area between the german parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery in the political heart of berlin , could easily become a kind of mini-soccer city .
adidas , the german sports apparel producer , wants to set up shop there . adidas and other companies hope to take advantage of the confluence of sports fans and the overall good mood .
" with 64 games overall , and 100,000 spectators for each and every game , we will reach millions on a scale of incredible magnitude , " said fifa 's herren .

" ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing . " in the letter he wrote about a medical report that he got that showed that there were strong drugs in his system only used for treating leprosy or tuberculosis , " said tomanovic . milosevic was found dead in his prison bed saturday at the tribunal in the hague , where he was being judged for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity over the 1990s balkan wars that killed more than 200,000 people . hardcore loyalists to the man branded the " butcher of the balkans " accused the un court of responsibility for his death , some even laying accusations of murder by poisoning . suicide not ruled out chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte dismissed such allegations as " rumors " and said she could not rule out the possibility that the 64-year-old had committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte , prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia " we must now wait for the results of the autopsy to see the cause of death but we have no choice -lrb- but -rrb- between a normal natural death and suicide , " she told a news conference . last month , the judges denied a request from milosevic to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague .
milosevic suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems . autopsy on sunday an autopsy started in the afternoon in a dutch forensic institute and was expected to last several hours , un war tribunal spokesman christian chartier told afp .
" it is unlikely that the results will be known today -lrb- sunday -rrb- , " he added . a toxicological examination of the body was also being conducted . fausto pocar , president of the un war crimes tribunal , said the autopsy , also attended by serbian government medical experts , was required by dutch law to establish cause of death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic in the court room milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .

but chief un prosecutor carla del ponte said suicide can not be excluded until the autopsy results are in - probably late sunday or early monday . milosevic 's family in moscow and political allies in belgrade have raised suspicions about his death and said the un court is responsible .
a legal aide claimed that the former strongman feared he was being poisoned in un custody . last month the judges denied a request from milosevic , 64 , who suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems , to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague . accusations milosevic 's brother borislav said the tribunal 's judges thus bore " full responsibility " for his death , and serbian newspapers lashed out sunday at the war crimes tribunal , accusing it of " murder .

an icty spokeswoman said there was " no sign that he committed suicide , " but added : " we can not say that he died of natural causes .
we are waiting for the report . " " the tribunal has nothing to be blamed for , " tribunal spokesman christian chartier said . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . escaped justice milosevic had been on trial since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
he also faced genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia , where serb military strategies devised to depopulate non-serb areas became known as " ethnic cleansing . " among his opponents and victims , his death just weeks before his mammoth trial was set to finish created dismay that he had forever escaped justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte " the death of slobodan milosevic , a few weeks before the completion of his trial , will prevent justice in his case , " del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- said saturday . " however , the crimes for which he was accused , including genocide , can not be left unpunished , " she added , referring to fugitive genocide suspects , bosnian serbs radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , to be captured and sent to the hague . serbian reaction on the streets of belgrade , serbs reacted with a mixture of shock , anger and deep suspicion .

" ' they would like to poison me .
i 'm seriously concerned and worried ' , " he quoted milosevic as writing . " in the letter he wrote about a medical report that he got that showed that there were strong drugs in his system only used for treating leprosy or tuberculosis , " said tomanovic . milosevic was found dead in his prison bed saturday at the tribunal in the hague , where he was being judged for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity over the 1990s balkan wars that killed more than 200,000 people . hardcore loyalists to the man branded the " butcher of the balkans " accused the un court of responsibility for his death , some even laying accusations of murder by poisoning . suicide not ruled out chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte dismissed such allegations as " rumors " and said she could not rule out the possibility that the 64-year-old had committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte , prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia " we must now wait for the results of the autopsy to see the cause of death but we have no choice -lrb- but -rrb- between a normal natural death and suicide , " she told a news conference . last month , the judges denied a request from milosevic to undergo medical treatment in moscow , saying he could be treated by his russian doctors in the hague .
milosevic suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems . autopsy on sunday an autopsy started in the afternoon in a dutch forensic institute and was expected to last several hours , un war tribunal spokesman christian chartier told afp .

he also faced genocide charges for the 1992-95 bosnian conflict , notably the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys - the biggest single atrocity in europe since world war ii . his death was announced just six days after the suicide in the same prison of his former ally , 50-year-old croatian serb ex-leader milan babic , who had admitted crimes against humanity during the 1991-95 war in croatia . del ponte said it was " a great pity for justice " that milosevic died before a verdict could be given in his trial . she said it was now more urgent than ever to arrest other most wanted war crimes fugitives : former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic and the wartime political leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic . survivors of the srebrenica massacre said milosevic had cheated justice but serbian newspapers lashed out at the tribunal itself , accusing it of murder . " the hague killed milosevic , " blared the front pages of both press and glas javnosti , against black backgrounds bearing large portrait pictures . supporters pay tribute dozens of hardcore supporters queued to pay tribute in front of his party seat in central belgrade , where a large photograph of milosevic and a book of condolences were laid on a table in the entrance hall . " slobo , serbia has died with you , " said a written message placed nearby . milosevic " did not die , he was murdered in the hague prison , " said senior party official ivica dacic , describing his death as an " irreparable loss " to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic elsewhere in belgrade , his death added a haunting poignancy to a ceremony marking the slaying three years ago of zoran djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , the reformist serbian prime minister who had sent him to face justice . in bijeljina , in the bosnian serb entity republika srpksa , candles were lit near a monument where posters of milosevic were plastered .
" heroes never die " and " we love you , " read the captions . milosevic 's family were divided over where he should be laid to rest , with his wife mira - herself a former powerful political figure , but now facing an arrest warrant if she returns to serbia - reportedly wanting burial in russia where she now lives . brother borislav and daughter marija said he should be buried in belgrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2006 bird flu gives rise to moral dilemmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of bird flu , consumption of animals by people is an ethical problem in itself is killing animals morally admissible ?
dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .
and that 's fatal , because they 're suppressing the fact that killing so many animals is something that people can do only most reluctantly . no matter how you argue about it , even when animals die without pain ; it seems to me that very little thought is given to the fact that we should be have moral and ethical concerns about it .
and if we do n't care that these are living beings that are in many ways similar to us , that they are capable of feeling pain and joy , happiness and sadness , then we must have lost some part of our moral sense .
and that is something we should try go regain immediately . in its theoretical transmissibility to humans , h5n1 reminds us of how close we are , biologically speaking , to animals .
on the other hand , we are committing mass killings of those same animals .
how can we solve that paradox ? the question is : how come we are so special in this world , and to what extent can we say that animals share that special status with us ?
if we take this question seriously , there will be serious consequences for our interaction with animals .
but not only in the context of bird flu , but also in relation to the 18 kilos -lrb- 40 pounds -rrb- of poultry which are eaten per capita in germany every year . in the end , the main issue with the mass slaughter of poultry is not whether animals should be killed at all , but rather whether they should perhaps be killed a little earlier than usual .
with all the opposition to these measures , it is important not to lose sight of the more comprehensive question about the moral justification of our everyday animal consumption . philipp krakau interviewed ralf stoecker -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the facts the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .

dw-world spoke to ethics professor ralf stoecker about the moral aspects of preventive poultry slaughter in the context of avian influenza . dw-world : while no poultry has been struck by the disease in germany , thousands have been killed on the island of rügen as a preventive measure .
one has the impression that these measures were introduced in order to calm the public .
how would you asses these actions from the point of view of a moral philosopher ? ralf stoecker : there is a very simple answer to this question : killing animals for the purpose of pacifying people is not morally justified .
but it is the prevention of an epidemic that is usually cited as the reason for these killings , and the question is then if that is morally sufficient . but keeping poultry confined can prevent the spread of the disease from wild fowl to livestock .
yet on the island of rügen poultry was slaughtered preventively . philosophers have traditionally had great difficulties integrating animals into their moral categories .
albert schweizer said : " the same way that a housewife who has just mopped up her parlor makes sure the door stays closed so that the dog does n't come in to dirty up her floor its paws , european thinkers keep watch that no animals muck up their ethics . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. ralf stoecker teaches applied ethics at the university of potsdam this has led - both in everyday life and in moral philosophy - to contradictions .
we are , on the one hand , absolutely convinced that animals are not just objects , but living beings that we need to protect .
at the same time , everybody knows that millions of animals are killed every year for human consumption ; experiments are conducted on animals ; and animals in circuses and zoos are not always treated properly . how would you act in the current situation ? the question is often posed as if one had to choose between saving people or animals .
but so far , the actual effects of avian influenza on humanity have been slight ; fewer have died of it globally than the average number of flu-related deaths in germany .
people in germany are thus not under acute threat at the moment . the other question is whether it is justified to kill animals as a preventive measure .
if you argue that the animal stock in which bird flu has already broken out is already condemned to death , and that by killing some animals you could actually save many other animal lives , that is an altogether different kind of argument .
in that case you 're juxtaposing some dead birds on the one hand with many dead birds on the other . this kind of juxtaposition is not acceptable when you deal with people .
you could n't simply sacrifice a few people for many others .
but it 's at least not strange to say that it is a good argument when birds are concerned .
whether it is convincing or not , depends on the extent of problems related to the vaccination alternative . can one reach a moral judgment then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are still not under direct threat what 's important is not how you decide the moral philosophical question , but that you actually recognize the moral philosophical dilemma .
statements by politicians and experts often make it seem that the mass killing of birds is a purely technical , organizational or economical problem .

mission managers are confident they now have enough data from the first satellite , giove-a , to secure the network 's allocated frequencies .
this means there is now no urgency to fly giove-b , which was originally set for lift-off this spring .
by 2010 , the 3.4bn-euro -lrb- £ 2.3bn ; $ 4bn -rrb- project will comprise 30 satellites .
it will deliver precise navigation and timing data across the globe .
analysts expect the new constellation to drive a multi-billion-euro industry , creating perhaps 140,000 jobs .
sat-nav has countless applications in the daily lives of consumers , from car guidance systems to feature-packed mobile phones .
while public signals from the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- are already widely used by the likes of sailors , mountaineers and motorists , the us military reserves the right to limit their use or switch them off for security reasons .
in building galileo , european states are seeking a system over which they have independent control .
' experimental scope ' giove-a was built in the uk by surrey satellite technology ltd -lrb- sstl -rrb- .
it was launched on 28 december from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan .

giuliano gatti , of the european space agency , said the experiments needed to satisfy the itu had been completed , and the data would now be submitted for scrutiny .
this means there is a period of grace for giove-b .
" the -lrb- giove-a -rrb- satellite is performing very well and therefore there is no urgency to launch immediately giove-b , " mr gatti told the bbc news website .
he said the second test satellite would now be launched some time between september and november .
" at that time , we will have the result of experiments with giove-a , " he added .
" by launching two satellites , we can extend the experimental scope . "
hi-tech clock the contract to build giove-b was awarded to galileo industries , a consortium that includes uk-based eads-astrium .
it will demonstrate key technologies not on the first satellite .

" it is a new space-based technology , " commented john paffett of sstl .
" it will give the galileo system high-precision accuracy for satellite-navigation position determination . "
winning the contract to build giove-a was regarded as a major coup for the small guildford-based company sstl , a spin-off from the university of surrey .

mission managers are confident they now have enough data from the first satellite , giove-a , to secure the network 's allocated frequencies .
this means there is now no urgency to fly giove-b , which was originally set for lift-off this spring .
by 2010 , the 3.4bn-euro -lrb- £ 2.3bn ; $ 4bn -rrb- project will comprise 30 satellites .
it will deliver precise navigation and timing data across the globe .
analysts expect the new constellation to drive a multi-billion-euro industry , creating perhaps 140,000 jobs .
sat-nav has countless applications in the daily lives of consumers , from car guidance systems to feature-packed mobile phones .
while public signals from the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- are already widely used by the likes of sailors , mountaineers and motorists , the us military reserves the right to limit their use or switch them off for security reasons .
in building galileo , european states are seeking a system over which they have independent control .
' experimental scope ' giove-a was built in the uk by surrey satellite technology ltd -lrb- sstl -rrb- .
it was launched on 28 december from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan .
the spacecraft 's primary task was to secure the frequencies allocated to galileo by the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- .
giuliano gatti , of the european space agency , said the experiments needed to satisfy the itu had been completed , and the data would now be submitted for scrutiny .
this means there is a period of grace for giove-b .
" the -lrb- giove-a -rrb- satellite is performing very well and therefore there is no urgency to launch immediately giove-b , " mr gatti told the bbc news website .
he said the second test satellite would now be launched some time between september and november .
" at that time , we will have the result of experiments with giove-a , " he added .
" by launching two satellites , we can extend the experimental scope . "
hi-tech clock the contract to build giove-b was awarded to galileo industries , a consortium that includes uk-based eads-astrium .
it will demonstrate key technologies not on the first satellite .
the sat-nav future navigation for navigation 's sake will not drive applications uptake pushed forward by services that add value to data huge potential for internet-linked services run off mobiles e.g. finding a restaurant and directing you to nearest atm multimedia delivered to tourists ' mobiles as they walk around ' guardian angel ' services will locate separated children possibilities are endless ; mobile firms already brainstorming database and billing companies planning for large markets galileo puts uk on map q & a : europe 's galileo project these include a hydrogen maser clock , one of the key components of the galileo set-up that should allow users to pinpoint their position on the planet down to a few centimetres .
" it is a new space-based technology , " commented john paffett of sstl .
" it will give the galileo system high-precision accuracy for satellite-navigation position determination . "
winning the contract to build giove-a was regarded as a major coup for the small guildford-based company sstl , a spin-off from the university of surrey .
the success of the mission was marked on friday at a ceremony organised by the european space agency .

the bbc politics show reports that the plans , to go to local health boards this week , propose closing abergele and hm stanley at st asaph , while llandudno hospital could be downgraded .
the review argues that services should be concentrated at ysbyty gwynedd , glan clwyd and wrexham maelor hospitals .
if health chiefs agree , the plans would be put out for public consultation .
nhs managers say it is about ensuring the best care is available but opposition assembly members are concerned it is more about cost cutting .
there has been uncertainty about the future of the three hospitals after first details of the review , which started last july , emerged last month .
by november , health officials had identified five possible options for the future of hospital services in the region .
it is proposed to concentrate more services at three general hospitals in a statement last month , an nhs spokesperson described the findings as an " exciting new vision " , with services being boosted at the three main general hospitals as centres of excellence .

services include stroke and rehabilitation care for the elderly .
llandudno hospital has had £ 4.5m investment over the last few years , including two wards and a rehabilitation department .

but behind the scenes , there is a contentious issue .
this week , mps will take a free vote on whether to ban the docking - or partial amputation - of dogs ' tails as part of the animal welfare bill .
major veterinary organisations and animal welfare groups condemn the practice as cruel and unnecessary and are demanding a ban .
opponents say there should at least be an exemption for working dogs which , they say , can seriously injure full length tails .
louise hubball reports .
these eight week old schnauzer puppies were docked at two days old .
dogs ' tails have been docked for centuries , but today it 's an emotive issue .
at crufts , many breeds shown , traditionally have docked tails .
this is the difference a ban would make ; - a standard schnauzer with a docked tail and one with a full length tail .
breeder mary moore lives near bridgwater and has shown dogs at crufts since 1965 , last year winning best of breed in the schnauzer class .
traditionally docked breeds , can be entered into shows with long tails , and although mary says she 's open minded on the issue , she is concerned about the impact a ban would have ; - since legislation in 1993 , puppies ' tails can only be docked by a vet , and the vet is free to choose if they offer a service or not .
john bower is a partner at the veterinary hospital in plymouth ; - he has been opposed to tail docking since he qualified 30 years ago .
the royal college of veterinary surgeons and the british veterinary association are also opposed to docking , unless it 's for medical reasons .
although some vets continue to dock , the practice is no longer taught in veterinary colleges .
but there is strong contingent , who believe that working dogs should be exempt from a possible ban in the interests of animal welfare .
gundogs have had their tails docked to prevent it being damaged during shoots , as they work in the thick undergrowth .
for those in favour of the exemption , it 's a straight forward animal welfare issue .
and it 's not just the shooting community .
the association of chief police officers has stated that it 's up to the discretion of individual forces , whether to dock puppies ' tails for operational reasons , subject to veterinary advice .
the government had favoured the status quo on the docking issue .
however , in january it bowed to pressure from mps and moved towards a complete ban .
on tuesday the mps will have a free vote ; - the three options being the status quo , a complete ban or an exemption for working dogs .
