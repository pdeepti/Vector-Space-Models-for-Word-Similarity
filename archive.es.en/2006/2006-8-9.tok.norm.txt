" normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '

swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .

" it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .

however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened .

the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .

most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened .

the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

" across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

he said that the plan would help strengthen the government in beirut and contribute to the development of a more independent , democratic lebanon . troop withdrawals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli is considering extending its presence in lebanon but wrangling over israeli troop withdrawals has further slowed progress on a un resolution .
lebanon wants an immediate ceasefire and a quick withdrawal of thousands of israeli troops from its south , while israel says it will only pull out when an international force is in place to keep hezbollah at bay . coinciding with steinmeier 's visit , israel 's security cabinet convened on wednesday to consider whether to send troops deeper into lebanon to fight hezbollah militants in the absence of an agreement . according to reports , the proposed next stage of the israeli offensive would involve a military push to the litani river , 20 km -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- inside lebanon , and possibly beyond . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier sees chance for revised un resolution during a visit to the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday he has increasing confidence that a resolution to stop fighting between israel and hezbollah can be passed by friday .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

" we 're on the brink of a television revolution , " the president of bitkom - the german association of telecommunications and new media industries - proclaimed in berlin this week .
the reason for willi berchtold 's enthusiasm ?
deutsche telekom has secured the rights to broadcast german national soccer league matches over the internet in a bid to boost its " triple play " offering of high-speed internet bundled with basic telephone and television services . at present , telekom can only offer triple play to a small number of customers - a company spokesman gave an estimate of 3.3 million households .
but the company hopes to see this number almost double by the end of the year , and to have 1 million triple-play customers by 2007 . after earlier reports of delays to telekom 's t-home internet television system , the company now expects to be ready for the start of the bundesliga season on friday .
the telecommunications giant said it will be able to broadcast 70 channels on its system , though this should increase to as many as 100 once licensing agreements with other stations have been signed . beginning of a boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitkom president willi berchtold for bitkom , telekom 's bundesliga deal represents the beginnings of a boom in internet-tv services in germany .
berchtold pointed to a study by the market research group gartner , which predicts that by the year 2010 , 2.8 million german households will watch tv via the internet .
presently , the market for internet-tv in germany mainly consists of downloads . the telecommunications industry association says there 's room for improvement , as germany currently lags far behind other eu countries , such as italy and france , in catching the internet-tv bug .
according to bitkom , france will claim the top spot on the european market by the end of the year with some 1.7 million internet-tv subscribers . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga agrees on massive sponsorship deal with t-com deutsche telekom came out on top in a sponsorship deal with the bundesliga it announced wednesday , while pay broadcaster premiere got sent to the bench .

" following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .

talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert are scheduled for later in the day .
in an interview with german broadcaster ard on tuesday evening , steinmeier said he intended to discuss lebanon 's deteriorating humanitarian situation with israeli officials .
and while he earlier expressed confidence that a un resolution to stop the fighting in lebanon could be passed by friday , he added that a solution to the current crisis could only be found if there was acceptance of the resolution in the region . steinmeier 's talks in israel are also likely to focus on beirut 's suggestion to replace israeli troops in southern lebanon with 15,000 lebanese soldiers .

he is expected to push for acceptance of a united nations resolution aimed at ending the fighting in lebanon . on wednesday morning , steinmeier met with israeli defense minister amir peretz .
talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert are scheduled for later in the day .
in an interview with german broadcaster ard on tuesday evening , steinmeier said he intended to discuss lebanon 's deteriorating humanitarian situation with israeli officials .
and while he earlier expressed confidence that a un resolution to stop the fighting in lebanon could be passed by friday , he added that a solution to the current crisis could only be found if there was acceptance of the resolution in the region . steinmeier 's talks in israel are also likely to focus on beirut 's suggestion to replace israeli troops in southern lebanon with 15,000 lebanese soldiers .
he said that the plan would help strengthen the government in beirut and contribute to the development of a more independent , democratic lebanon . troop withdrawals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli is considering extending its presence in lebanon but wrangling over israeli troop withdrawals has further slowed progress on a un resolution .
lebanon wants an immediate ceasefire and a quick withdrawal of thousands of israeli troops from its south , while israel says it will only pull out when an international force is in place to keep hezbollah at bay . coinciding with steinmeier 's visit , israel 's security cabinet convened on wednesday to consider whether to send troops deeper into lebanon to fight hezbollah militants in the absence of an agreement . according to reports , the proposed next stage of the israeli offensive would involve a military push to the litani river , 20 km -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- inside lebanon , and possibly beyond . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier sees chance for revised un resolution during a visit to the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday he has increasing confidence that a resolution to stop fighting between israel and hezbollah can be passed by friday .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .
she said that now people feel that enough time has passed and they 've gained enough distance from the regime that they are once again interested in finding questions to the unanswered questions of the past . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin plans new spotlight for its famous wall for years , tourists have wandered around berlin looking - sometimes in vain - for the famous landmark that marked the divided city .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany ban smoking in restaurants ?
while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .
furthermore , there are no mandatory smoke-free zones in public buildings and the observance of non-smoking areas in restaurants is not officially verified . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .

most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened .

the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence .

" this accident -lrb- in sweden -rrb- shows that there are imminent risks in the system , " gabriel said , adding that the complex system of running nuclear reactors could n't be completely foolproof . " normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '

swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .

critics say that this will hurt the country 's high standard for pharmacies . wednesday 's ruling came after a pharmacist in the southwestern city of saarbrücken had filed a complaint against a local branch of doc morris internet pharmacy .
the pharmacist had argued that german law only allowed pharmacists and not corporations to open pharmacies . but citing the freedom of establishment under european law , state health officials had allowed doc morris to open shop a month ago . doc morris officials , who do most of their business over the internet , have said that they do not plan to open more branches in germany - the store in saarbrücken is the only one so far . erodi n g germa n y 's pharmacy la n dscape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red " a " like the one in the background is the trademark for german pharmacies critics , however , fear that the case will set a precedent for other discount pharmacy chains , who could eventually do away with the country 's established system of pharmacies owned by individual pharmacists . pointing to the german law against pharmacy chains , pharmacists ' associations have already filed additional law suits against the doc morris branch . " it does n't make sense that german law is supposedly no longer valid , " said heinz-günter wolf , the president of the german pharmacist association , abda . be n eficial for co n sumers ? but josef hecken , the health minister of the state of saarland , where saarbrücken is located , countered that germans would benefit from discount pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could discount pharmacies help reduce the costs of germany 's health system ?
" medication of the same quality can be bought for less , " said hecken , who approved the doc morris branch .
he added that liberalizing germany 's pharmacy landscape could also help to lower the country 's overall health sector costs . other politicians also backed the decision .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .

critics say that this will hurt the country 's high standard for pharmacies . wednesday 's ruling came after a pharmacist in the southwestern city of saarbrücken had filed a complaint against a local branch of doc morris internet pharmacy .
the pharmacist had argued that german law only allowed pharmacists and not corporations to open pharmacies . but citing the freedom of establishment under european law , state health officials had allowed doc morris to open shop a month ago . doc morris officials , who do most of their business over the internet , have said that they do not plan to open more branches in germany - the store in saarbrücken is the only one so far . erodi n g germa n y 's pharmacy la n dscape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red " a " like the one in the background is the trademark for german pharmacies critics , however , fear that the case will set a precedent for other discount pharmacy chains , who could eventually do away with the country 's established system of pharmacies owned by individual pharmacists . pointing to the german law against pharmacy chains , pharmacists ' associations have already filed additional law suits against the doc morris branch . " it does n't make sense that german law is supposedly no longer valid , " said heinz-günter wolf , the president of the german pharmacist association , abda . be n eficial for co n sumers ? but josef hecken , the health minister of the state of saarland , where saarbrücken is located , countered that germans would benefit from discount pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could discount pharmacies help reduce the costs of germany 's health system ?
" medication of the same quality can be bought for less , " said hecken , who approved the doc morris branch .
he added that liberalizing germany 's pharmacy landscape could also help to lower the country 's overall health sector costs . other politicians also backed the decision .

" we 're on the brink of a television revolution , " the president of bitkom - the german association of telecommunications and new media industries - proclaimed in berlin this week .
the reason for willi berchtold 's enthusiasm ?
deutsche telekom has secured the rights to broadcast german national soccer league matches over the internet in a bid to boost its " triple play " offering of high-speed internet bundled with basic telephone and television services . at present , telekom can only offer triple play to a small number of customers - a company spokesman gave an estimate of 3.3 million households .
but the company hopes to see this number almost double by the end of the year , and to have 1 million triple-play customers by 2007 . after earlier reports of delays to telekom 's t-home internet television system , the company now expects to be ready for the start of the bundesliga season on friday .
the telecommunications giant said it will be able to broadcast 70 channels on its system , though this should increase to as many as 100 once licensing agreements with other stations have been signed . beginning of a boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitkom president willi berchtold for bitkom , telekom 's bundesliga deal represents the beginnings of a boom in internet-tv services in germany .
berchtold pointed to a study by the market research group gartner , which predicts that by the year 2010 , 2.8 million german households will watch tv via the internet .
presently , the market for internet-tv in germany mainly consists of downloads . the telecommunications industry association says there 's room for improvement , as germany currently lags far behind other eu countries , such as italy and france , in catching the internet-tv bug .
according to bitkom , france will claim the top spot on the european market by the end of the year with some 1.7 million internet-tv subscribers . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga agrees on massive sponsorship deal with t-com deutsche telekom came out on top in a sponsorship deal with the bundesliga it announced wednesday , while pay broadcaster premiere got sent to the bench .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany ban smoking in restaurants ?
while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .
furthermore , there are no mandatory smoke-free zones in public buildings and the observance of non-smoking areas in restaurants is not officially verified . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german minister wants public smoking ban in 2007 germany 's minister for consumer affairs has said he expects a ban on smoking in public places to take effect sometime in 2007 .
whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

" we 're on the brink of a television revolution , " the president of bitkom - the german association of telecommunications and new media industries - proclaimed in berlin this week .
the reason for willi berchtold 's enthusiasm ?
deutsche telekom has secured the rights to broadcast german national soccer league matches over the internet in a bid to boost its " triple play " offering of high-speed internet bundled with basic telephone and television services . at present , telekom can only offer triple play to a small number of customers - a company spokesman gave an estimate of 3.3 million households .
but the company hopes to see this number almost double by the end of the year , and to have 1 million triple-play customers by 2007 . after earlier reports of delays to telekom 's t-home internet television system , the company now expects to be ready for the start of the bundesliga season on friday .
the telecommunications giant said it will be able to broadcast 70 channels on its system , though this should increase to as many as 100 once licensing agreements with other stations have been signed . beginning of a boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitkom president willi berchtold for bitkom , telekom 's bundesliga deal represents the beginnings of a boom in internet-tv services in germany .
berchtold pointed to a study by the market research group gartner , which predicts that by the year 2010 , 2.8 million german households will watch tv via the internet .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

the move comes on the heels of reactor closures in sweden due to safety concerns . german environment minister sigmar gabriel said wednesday that following the recent nuclear scare in sweden , all 17 of germany 's nuclear reactors will undergo stringent checks to determine that they are not exposed to risks . " this accident -lrb- in sweden -rrb- shows that there are imminent risks in the system , " gabriel said , adding that the complex system of running nuclear reactors could n't be completely foolproof . " normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '
i consider that irresponsible when it comes to a security risk , " gabriel said .
" what we 're witnessing here is a normal scenario when you 're using nuclear energy .
unfortunately , this normality is a problem . " the minister said he had absolutely no understanding for operators who want longer life spans for old reactors . " rather you should think about taking old reactors off the power grid , " gabriel said .
" that would contribute towards securing the safety of nuclear plants . " swedish breakdown reignites nuclear debate the minister 's comments come in the wake of a nuclear malfunctioning in sweden recently which has reignited the debate in germany about the use of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the malfunctioning at the forsmark plant sent jitters around europe a reactor in forsmark in sweden was taken off the power grid earlier this month when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started . a former construction manager at the plant said the incident was " close to nuclear meltdown " and that it was sheer luck that it did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .
swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .
germany is committed to phasing out nuclear energy and shut down its last nuclear plant by 2020 . no " acute danger " in germany gabriel on wednesday underlined that there was no " acute danger " amid nuclear power plants in germany . " there 's no one-to-one translation of the scenario in sweden , " he said , pointing out that german nuclear reactors used a different technology for emergency power than swedish reactors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '
i consider that irresponsible when it comes to a security risk , " gabriel said .
" what we 're witnessing here is a normal scenario when you 're using nuclear energy .
unfortunately , this normality is a problem . " the minister said he had absolutely no understanding for operators who want longer life spans for old reactors . " rather you should think about taking old reactors off the power grid , " gabriel said .
" that would contribute towards securing the safety of nuclear plants . " swedish breakdown reignites nuclear debate the minister 's comments come in the wake of a nuclear malfunctioning in sweden recently which has reignited the debate in germany about the use of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the malfunctioning at the forsmark plant sent jitters around europe a reactor in forsmark in sweden was taken off the power grid earlier this month when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started . a former construction manager at the plant said the incident was " close to nuclear meltdown " and that it was sheer luck that it did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .
swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .
germany is committed to phasing out nuclear energy and shut down its last nuclear plant by 2020 . no " acute danger " in germany gabriel on wednesday underlined that there was no " acute danger " amid nuclear power plants in germany . " there 's no one-to-one translation of the scenario in sweden , " he said , pointing out that german nuclear reactors used a different technology for emergency power than swedish reactors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .
plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to play it extra safe with its nuclear reactors after the breakdown in sweden germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .
the move comes on the heels of reactor closures in sweden due to safety concerns . german environment minister sigmar gabriel said wednesday that following the recent nuclear scare in sweden , all 17 of germany 's nuclear reactors will undergo stringent checks to determine that they are not exposed to risks . " this accident -lrb- in sweden -rrb- shows that there are imminent risks in the system , " gabriel said , adding that the complex system of running nuclear reactors could n't be completely foolproof . " normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '
i consider that irresponsible when it comes to a security risk , " gabriel said .
" what we 're witnessing here is a normal scenario when you 're using nuclear energy .
unfortunately , this normality is a problem . " the minister said he had absolutely no understanding for operators who want longer life spans for old reactors . " rather you should think about taking old reactors off the power grid , " gabriel said .
" that would contribute towards securing the safety of nuclear plants . " swedish breakdown reignites nuclear debate the minister 's comments come in the wake of a nuclear malfunctioning in sweden recently which has reignited the debate in germany about the use of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the malfunctioning at the forsmark plant sent jitters around europe a reactor in forsmark in sweden was taken off the power grid earlier this month when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started . a former construction manager at the plant said the incident was " close to nuclear meltdown " and that it was sheer luck that it did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .
swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .
germany is committed to phasing out nuclear energy and shut down its last nuclear plant by 2020 . no " acute danger " in germany gabriel on wednesday underlined that there was no " acute danger " amid nuclear power plants in germany . " there 's no one-to-one translation of the scenario in sweden , " he said , pointing out that german nuclear reactors used a different technology for emergency power than swedish reactors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel .

steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .

livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germany ban smoking in restaurants ?
while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .
furthermore , there are no mandatory smoke-free zones in public buildings and the observance of non-smoking areas in restaurants is not officially verified . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german minister wants public smoking ban in 2007 germany 's minister for consumer affairs has said he expects a ban on smoking in public places to take effect sometime in 2007 .
whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .

he is expected to push for acceptance of a united nations resolution aimed at ending the fighting in lebanon . on wednesday morning , steinmeier met with israeli defense minister amir peretz .
talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert are scheduled for later in the day .
in an interview with german broadcaster ard on tuesday evening , steinmeier said he intended to discuss lebanon 's deteriorating humanitarian situation with israeli officials .
and while he earlier expressed confidence that a un resolution to stop the fighting in lebanon could be passed by friday , he added that a solution to the current crisis could only be found if there was acceptance of the resolution in the region . steinmeier 's talks in israel are also likely to focus on beirut 's suggestion to replace israeli troops in southern lebanon with 15,000 lebanese soldiers .
he said that the plan would help strengthen the government in beirut and contribute to the development of a more independent , democratic lebanon . troop withdrawals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli is considering extending its presence in lebanon but wrangling over israeli troop withdrawals has further slowed progress on a un resolution .
lebanon wants an immediate ceasefire and a quick withdrawal of thousands of israeli troops from its south , while israel says it will only pull out when an international force is in place to keep hezbollah at bay . coinciding with steinmeier 's visit , israel 's security cabinet convened on wednesday to consider whether to send troops deeper into lebanon to fight hezbollah militants in the absence of an agreement . according to reports , the proposed next stage of the israeli offensive would involve a military push to the litani river , 20 km -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- inside lebanon , and possibly beyond . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier sees chance for revised un resolution during a visit to the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday he has increasing confidence that a resolution to stop fighting between israel and hezbollah can be passed by friday .

he is expected to push for acceptance of a united nations resolution aimed at ending the fighting in lebanon . on wednesday morning , steinmeier met with israeli defense minister amir peretz .
talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert are scheduled for later in the day .
in an interview with german broadcaster ard on tuesday evening , steinmeier said he intended to discuss lebanon 's deteriorating humanitarian situation with israeli officials .
and while he earlier expressed confidence that a un resolution to stop the fighting in lebanon could be passed by friday , he added that a solution to the current crisis could only be found if there was acceptance of the resolution in the region . steinmeier 's talks in israel are also likely to focus on beirut 's suggestion to replace israeli troops in southern lebanon with 15,000 lebanese soldiers .
he said that the plan would help strengthen the government in beirut and contribute to the development of a more independent , democratic lebanon . troop withdrawals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli is considering extending its presence in lebanon but wrangling over israeli troop withdrawals has further slowed progress on a un resolution .

" across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

critics say that this will hurt the country 's high standard for pharmacies . wednesday 's ruling came after a pharmacist in the southwestern city of saarbrücken had filed a complaint against a local branch of doc morris internet pharmacy .
the pharmacist had argued that german law only allowed pharmacists and not corporations to open pharmacies . but citing the freedom of establishment under european law , state health officials had allowed doc morris to open shop a month ago . doc morris officials , who do most of their business over the internet , have said that they do not plan to open more branches in germany - the store in saarbrücken is the only one so far . erodi n g germa n y 's pharmacy la n dscape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red " a " like the one in the background is the trademark for german pharmacies critics , however , fear that the case will set a precedent for other discount pharmacy chains , who could eventually do away with the country 's established system of pharmacies owned by individual pharmacists . pointing to the german law against pharmacy chains , pharmacists ' associations have already filed additional law suits against the doc morris branch . " it does n't make sense that german law is supposedly no longer valid , " said heinz-günter wolf , the president of the german pharmacist association , abda . be n eficial for co n sumers ? but josef hecken , the health minister of the state of saarland , where saarbrücken is located , countered that germans would benefit from discount pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could discount pharmacies help reduce the costs of germany 's health system ?
" medication of the same quality can be bought for less , " said hecken , who approved the doc morris branch .
he added that liberalizing germany 's pharmacy landscape could also help to lower the country 's overall health sector costs . other politicians also backed the decision . " finally someone from the -lrb- conservative -rrb- union parties dares to show how expensive the protection of pharmacist privileges is for the insured , " said reinhard bütikofer , the leader of germany 's green party . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

though he said he was unable to predict just how much longer the bloody conflict between israel and hezbollah is going to last , but that there would be no winning side . ' ' a war is always lost because a war is loss of life and destruction .
we 've learned it the hard way in europe , " he said . otte has been touring the middle east for the past three years , developing important contacts and gathering information about how to address the deeply entrenched problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists cross the border from lebanon european union diplomats have made numerous diplomatic excursions to the middle east in attempts to secure an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
however , there is currently no unified position within the bloc as to how the eu can effectively contribute to the peace process .
otte advocates an immediate cessation of hostilities . ' ' it is a unanimous feeling and conviction in the european union that there is no military solution , " he said , though he added that not everyone he met during his travels of the middle east shared this belief . eu working towards resolution in the middle east otte said he attempts in his travels to deliver a message of patience , and pointed to europe 's experience of conflict resolution .
' ' our history shows that resolving conflicts for the long term means cooperation and integration , " he said .
' ' it 's part of our mission , in the external actions of the eu , to offer this model and the tools . "
the european union remains prepared to work together with lebanon , israel , syria and other influential powers , he said , adding that he was sure that after the bombs have stopped falling , european funds would be available for the reconstruction of houses , bridges and infrastructure .
' ' there is an extreme readiness of the europeans to provide the tools to rebuild , the tools to sustain a non military solution as we ’ ve shown in the past , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otte hopes for an agreement between israel and palestine otte said a resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is key to stability in the middle east .
he said the so-called roadmap - the international peace plan that aims for a two-state solution within secure borders - must be put back on the table . " nobody can impose something on others , " he said .
' ' we can act as a guide if we overcome the present crisis in gaza -lsb- and -rsb- there is a good prospect for palestinians of all factions to agree on a program of government acceptable to the international community . " the preconditions for an israeli-palestinian resolution would have to involve the hamas-led palestinian authority recognizing the state of israel , otte said .
in return , israel must returning occupied territories - and not just in the form of separated islands . he did not specify a timeframe in which this should occur , but said the palestinians deserve a certain date by which they could expect change to take place . nathan witkop -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to play it extra safe with its nuclear reactors after the breakdown in sweden germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .
the move comes on the heels of reactor closures in sweden due to safety concerns . german environment minister sigmar gabriel said wednesday that following the recent nuclear scare in sweden , all 17 of germany 's nuclear reactors will undergo stringent checks to determine that they are not exposed to risks . " this accident -lrb- in sweden -rrb- shows that there are imminent risks in the system , " gabriel said , adding that the complex system of running nuclear reactors could n't be completely foolproof . " normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '
i consider that irresponsible when it comes to a security risk , " gabriel said .
" what we 're witnessing here is a normal scenario when you 're using nuclear energy .
unfortunately , this normality is a problem . " the minister said he had absolutely no understanding for operators who want longer life spans for old reactors . " rather you should think about taking old reactors off the power grid , " gabriel said .
" that would contribute towards securing the safety of nuclear plants . " swedish breakdown reignites nuclear debate the minister 's comments come in the wake of a nuclear malfunctioning in sweden recently which has reignited the debate in germany about the use of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the malfunctioning at the forsmark plant sent jitters around europe a reactor in forsmark in sweden was taken off the power grid earlier this month when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started . a former construction manager at the plant said the incident was " close to nuclear meltdown " and that it was sheer luck that it did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .
swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .
germany is committed to phasing out nuclear energy and shut down its last nuclear plant by 2020 . no " acute danger " in germany gabriel on wednesday underlined that there was no " acute danger " amid nuclear power plants in germany . " there 's no one-to-one translation of the scenario in sweden , " he said , pointing out that german nuclear reactors used a different technology for emergency power than swedish reactors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad . with a view to germany 's unique historical relationship to israel , chancellor angela merkel makes her position clear that she is behind israel in the current middle east conflict .
she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

though he said he was unable to predict just how much longer the bloody conflict between israel and hezbollah is going to last , but that there would be no winning side . ' ' a war is always lost because a war is loss of life and destruction .
we 've learned it the hard way in europe , " he said . otte has been touring the middle east for the past three years , developing important contacts and gathering information about how to address the deeply entrenched problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists cross the border from lebanon european union diplomats have made numerous diplomatic excursions to the middle east in attempts to secure an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
however , there is currently no unified position within the bloc as to how the eu can effectively contribute to the peace process .
otte advocates an immediate cessation of hostilities . ' ' it is a unanimous feeling and conviction in the european union that there is no military solution , " he said , though he added that not everyone he met during his travels of the middle east shared this belief . eu working towards resolution in the middle east otte said he attempts in his travels to deliver a message of patience , and pointed to europe 's experience of conflict resolution .
' ' our history shows that resolving conflicts for the long term means cooperation and integration , " he said .
' ' it 's part of our mission , in the external actions of the eu , to offer this model and the tools . "
the european union remains prepared to work together with lebanon , israel , syria and other influential powers , he said , adding that he was sure that after the bombs have stopped falling , european funds would be available for the reconstruction of houses , bridges and infrastructure .
' ' there is an extreme readiness of the europeans to provide the tools to rebuild , the tools to sustain a non military solution as we ’ ve shown in the past , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otte hopes for an agreement between israel and palestine otte said a resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is key to stability in the middle east .
he said the so-called roadmap - the international peace plan that aims for a two-state solution within secure borders - must be put back on the table . " nobody can impose something on others , " he said .
' ' we can act as a guide if we overcome the present crisis in gaza -lsb- and -rsb- there is a good prospect for palestinians of all factions to agree on a program of government acceptable to the international community . " the preconditions for an israeli-palestinian resolution would have to involve the hamas-led palestinian authority recognizing the state of israel , otte said .
in return , israel must returning occupied territories - and not just in the form of separated islands . he did not specify a timeframe in which this should occur , but said the palestinians deserve a certain date by which they could expect change to take place . nathan witkop -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .
furthermore , there are no mandatory smoke-free zones in public buildings and the observance of non-smoking areas in restaurants is not officially verified . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad . with a view to germany 's unique historical relationship to israel , chancellor angela merkel makes her position clear that she is behind israel in the current middle east conflict .
she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .

critics say that this will hurt the country 's high standard for pharmacies . wednesday 's ruling came after a pharmacist in the southwestern city of saarbrücken had filed a complaint against a local branch of doc morris internet pharmacy .
the pharmacist had argued that german law only allowed pharmacists and not corporations to open pharmacies . but citing the freedom of establishment under european law , state health officials had allowed doc morris to open shop a month ago . doc morris officials , who do most of their business over the internet , have said that they do not plan to open more branches in germany - the store in saarbrücken is the only one so far . erodi n g germa n y 's pharmacy la n dscape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red " a " like the one in the background is the trademark for german pharmacies critics , however , fear that the case will set a precedent for other discount pharmacy chains , who could eventually do away with the country 's established system of pharmacies owned by individual pharmacists . pointing to the german law against pharmacy chains , pharmacists ' associations have already filed additional law suits against the doc morris branch .

" medication of the same quality can be bought for less , " said hecken , who approved the doc morris branch .
he added that liberalizing germany 's pharmacy landscape could also help to lower the country 's overall health sector costs . other politicians also backed the decision . " finally someone from the -lrb- conservative -rrb- union parties dares to show how expensive the protection of pharmacist privileges is for the insured , " said reinhard bütikofer , the leader of germany 's green party . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

though he said he was unable to predict just how much longer the bloody conflict between israel and hezbollah is going to last , but that there would be no winning side . ' ' a war is always lost because a war is loss of life and destruction .
we 've learned it the hard way in europe , " he said . otte has been touring the middle east for the past three years , developing important contacts and gathering information about how to address the deeply entrenched problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists cross the border from lebanon european union diplomats have made numerous diplomatic excursions to the middle east in attempts to secure an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
however , there is currently no unified position within the bloc as to how the eu can effectively contribute to the peace process .
otte advocates an immediate cessation of hostilities . ' ' it is a unanimous feeling and conviction in the european union that there is no military solution , " he said , though he added that not everyone he met during his travels of the middle east shared this belief . eu working towards resolution in the middle east otte said he attempts in his travels to deliver a message of patience , and pointed to europe 's experience of conflict resolution .
' ' our history shows that resolving conflicts for the long term means cooperation and integration , " he said .
' ' it 's part of our mission , in the external actions of the eu , to offer this model and the tools . "
the european union remains prepared to work together with lebanon , israel , syria and other influential powers , he said , adding that he was sure that after the bombs have stopped falling , european funds would be available for the reconstruction of houses , bridges and infrastructure .
' ' there is an extreme readiness of the europeans to provide the tools to rebuild , the tools to sustain a non military solution as we ’ ve shown in the past , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otte hopes for an agreement between israel and palestine otte said a resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is key to stability in the middle east .
he said the so-called roadmap - the international peace plan that aims for a two-state solution within secure borders - must be put back on the table . " nobody can impose something on others , " he said .
' ' we can act as a guide if we overcome the present crisis in gaza -lsb- and -rsb- there is a good prospect for palestinians of all factions to agree on a program of government acceptable to the international community . " the preconditions for an israeli-palestinian resolution would have to involve the hamas-led palestinian authority recognizing the state of israel , otte said .
in return , israel must returning occupied territories - and not just in the form of separated islands . he did not specify a timeframe in which this should occur , but said the palestinians deserve a certain date by which they could expect change to take place . nathan witkop -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .
in many cases , however , family members could not provide information as they were either told little about the deaths of their loved ones , or fed lies made up by east german officials about the circumstances of the deaths . personalizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month into construction of the berlin wall , a woman climbs out of her apartment building , bordering on the west german side .
the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law . while the rights of non-smokers is a hot topic for lawmakers right now , the absence of legal precedence for the rights of smoking job-seekers was brought to attention recently when an irish call center noted in a help-wanted ad that smokers would n't be considered for the position . not hiring someone because he or she smokes is not prohibited under eu law , according to eu commission officials .
anti-discrimination hiring laws , which have also been passed in germany , only forbid discrimination based on age , handicaps , religious conviction and sexual orientation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking sections " there is n't any case law " concerning smoking or not smoking as a selection criterion for filling a job position , said a spokesperson from the labor ministry in berlin .
each individual case would have to be brought to court for a decision . while ireland , italy and the netherlands are among the european union member states that have recently implemented smoking bans in public places , the eu is now also putting pressure on germany to follow suit . the right -lrb- n ot -rrb- to smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all cigarette machines will accept debit cards to prevent underage tobacco sales by 2007 but not all in germany back the plan to ban smokers from restaurants . " we reject a total smoking ban in restaurants , " edda müller , chairwoman for the national association of consumer centers told the berliner zeitung daily .
consumers are adults and can decide for themselves , she added . the organization would support more non-smoking areas in pubs .
only about one-third of the food establishments in germany currently offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections . the nutrition-consumption-restaurant trade union -lrb- ngg -rrb- , on the other hand , said it favors a general smoking ban in restaurants . " employee rights key to smoki n g ba n " currently , employers are legally required to offer smoke-free options in the workplace .
eating establishments , however , represent an exception to this law , which ngg spokeswoman karin vladimirov said should be reconsidered in order to protect restaurant employees . suspending this exception in the labor law would automatically result in a smoking ban in restaurants , which germany 's labor ministry called the " easiest solution . " restaurant law is currently legislated at the federal level but will be shifted to the state level under upcoming federalism reforms , adding uncertainty to the chances of suspending the clause exempting restaurants from protecting non-smoking employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no law that prohibits employers from making smoking habits a hiring criterion installing special filters or smoke removal systems has been suggested as an alternative to a complete smoking ban .
if this does n't help , said vladimirov , then the ngg union would support a complete smoking ban . the union , which represents employees working in industries associated with gastronomy and food and drink consumption , was previously against the ban .
it revised its position after taking into account the interests of restaurant employees and increased health awareness among the general population , vladimirov said . the protection of restaurant employees against second-hand smoke " is ultimately the key to a smoke-free food industry in germany , " said friedrich wiebel , chairman of a doctors ' organization that focuses on smoking and health issues . parliame n t awaits legislative proposal this fall germany 's parliament meanwhile is preparing to review legislation protecting non-smokers in the autumn .
margrit spielmann , a health expert from the social democratic party , drafted a proposal that has been signed by 140 parliamentarians so far . the document expresses regret that german law effectively does not yet offer any protection against second-hand smoke , reported german news agency dpa .

what have you got ?
the recipe for germany 's latest hit docu-soap , " you are what you eat . " germans love to poke fun at overweight americans but it 's slowly dawning on them that the trend towards a more obese population has caught on in europe , too .
in germany , every second person is classed as overweight , while around 13 percent of the population is obese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines in germany are growing ever bigger the executives at private broadcaster rtl ii probably did n't have to think too long about whether or not to launch a copycat production of the successful british tv show , " you are what you eat . " across the channel , junk-food addicted brits are whipped into shape by nutritionist gillian mckeith , whose tough-love approach forces the volunteer to confront the ugly truth about what they eat on a weekly basis , and be shocked into an about-face . the german version , " du bist was du isst , " follows the same concept , only it featuers 27-year-old kirsten ellert as the straight-talking nutritionist . more fruit , less fried foods while ellert 's favorite foods include chickpeas , lentils and beans , the people she advises on the show are more likely to scoff chips , sausages and sugary drinks .
watching them make the switch to salads and tofu clearly has high entertainment value - rtl ii has scooped impressive ratings for the docu-soap 's monday evening slot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is targeting growing obesity rates among children but the show 's success also reflects a genuine interest in a topic that politicians have been working hard to draw attention to - increasing levels of obesity , especially among the younger generation of germans , and decreasing levels of nutritional awareness . " what 's wrong with us ? "
rtl ii asks on the web site accompanying " du bist was du isst . "
" many children only know the taste of strawberries from chewing gum , ca n't tell a mango from an avocado , and only recognize lettuce from what appears on their hamburgers . " the german government , mindful that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb for the nation 's already stretched health care resources , has launched a campaign aimed at getting kids to eat better and exercise more frequently . that , says ellert in an interview on rtl ii 's web site , is also the message for the viewers and participants in her tv show . " this is not a diet show , " she said .
" the message is that losing weight does n't mean starving yourself .
i show people how they can change to a healthier lifestyle , and through that , they not only become slimmer , they also become healthier and have more energy .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .

" it 's the way to silence the weapons and i think we have to find it as quickly as possible , " he said , adding that the conflict could not be resolved unless hezbollah no longer posed a threat to israel . " the conflict-ridden neighborhood between israel and hezbollah can not be continued , " steinmeier said after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the two politicians also welcomed the proposal by lebanese premier fuad siniora to send 15,000 troops to the hezbollah-controlled southern part of the country .
steinmeier said it was an " important step " that showed that the lebanese government was willing to exercise its sovereignty .
livni said that lebanese troops should be accompanied by an international stabilization force to " keep the region clean " of hezbollah . france and us divided over lebanon resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke and fire rises after an israeli airstrike hit the suburbs of beirut last friday french president jacques chirac meanwhile voiced confidence an accord would be reached between french and us diplomats working on a new text to be put to the security council .
but he admitted that paris and washington - co-sponsors of an earlier draft rejected by lebanon and arab leaders - were now divided over how far to take on lebanon 's demands . " it seems indeed that there are american reservations towards adopting the proposal " integrating certain lebanese demands , chirac said . lebanon and arab nations opposed the earlier franco-american text , mainly on the grounds that it did not call for israel to withdraw its troops from lebanon after a truce in the four-week conflict . france mulls own resolution warning the conflict was a threat to the stability of the entire middle east , chirac hinted that france may press ahead alone and submit a resolution to the security council , with or without us support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will france bring its own resolution to the table ?
" if we fail to agree , we will have a security council debate at which each side will clearly reaffirm their position , including naturally france with its own resolution , " he said . chirac stressed that any final text should uphold lebanon 's " sovereignty , stability , unity and independence . " " israel and lebanon have reacted and we must take their reactions into account , notably the interests of lebanon , " he said , hailing beirut 's offer to deploy 15,000 men in south lebanon as a key to restoring national sovereignty . french troops for peacekeeping force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers are likely to become part of a peacekeeping mission in lebanon chirac also reaffirmed his country was willing to take part in a possible international force in lebanon following a ceasefire agreement . " following -lrb- a political agreement -rrb- , we can , in a month for example , put in place an international force in which france will naturally participate in one form or another , as long as its mandate is clear , " he said . because of its strong historical ties with lebanon , paris is widely expected to play a leading role in the deployment of any international force . israel widens offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists move into lebanon on tuesday israel 's security cabinet meanwhile agreed wednesday to expand its ground war in lebanon . " plans by defense minister amir peretz and the chief of staff for expanding the operation have been approved by the cabinet , " deputy prime minister eli yishai said after a six-hour meeting . peretz had already ordered the army to prepare to expand operations against hezbollah in a bid to reduce their rocket-launching capabilities , with israeli troops possibly going beyond the litani river , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- deep into lebanon . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a war is always lost because a war is loss of life " european special envoy to the middle east marc otte told deutsche welle that without a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah there will be no possibility for peace in the middle east .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .

she has reminded us of what triggered the current crisis in the already unstable middle east .
she has warned israel 's government , as led by prime minister ehud olmert , that its means must be commensurate with the situation .
at the same time , she has demanded that hezbollah guerillas first release the israeli soldiers they kidnapped and end their rocket strikes against israel before a ceasefire can occur . that this would only mean a carte blanche for israel to conduct war is obvious . no feel for the arab world in contrast to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who displayed a remarkable sense for the importance of german-arab ties and made great efforts to deepen them , schröder 's successor shows no noteworthy interest in those ties .
indeed , merkel 's position toward the war in the middle east conveys indifference toward the significance and unique features of german-arab relations . in the past 10 years , trade relations between germany and the arab world have absolutely boomed .
trade between germany and arab nations attained a value of 29 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
compare that to 2001 , when trade volume stood at less than 22 billion euros .
moreover , arab investments moved from the united states to germany as a result of the us restrictions imposed after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . of course , the spd / green party government 's rejection of the illegal war waged on iraq in 2003 gave germany a new aura of neutrality - and not only in the arab world .
in addition , then-chancellor schröder made several visits to arab countries , particularly to the persian gulf states .
the visits helped pave the way to more trade and investment agreements with german companies .
the visits also contributed to better understanding between opposing sides regarding the middle east conflict . merkel 's distant stance toward europe though the contract between the two parties of germany 's ruling coalition specifies continuity in the government 's middle east policies as they have been pursued until now , merkel is following a course aligned with that of us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair .
this has led to a weakening of the german-french alignment and , consequently , that of the european union , which nowadays appears weaker than ever as a player in global politics , particularly concerning the middle east . in fact , merkel 's stance toward the middle east has become increasingly washington-oriented since she took office last fall .
this development has come out in full force since the outbreak of the war in lebanon . in her first statement about the war , merkel repeated george w. bush 's comment about israel 's right to defend itself without , however , mentioning that civilians may not be killed in the process , and that european-arab relations may not be damaged .
furthermore , while the european union 's foreign ministers were trying to come to an agreement on a uniform approach to the situation which demanded an immediate ceasefire , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for his part was supporting london and demanded only a cessation of hostilities . opinion diverges among politicians public opinion , as well as that of politicians - whose number is growing as the scope and effects of israel 's bombing of lebanon on human lives become increasingly clear - diverges from merkel 's view .
merkel herself has until now not visited one arab country . one of these politicians is heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for economic cooperation and development , who has said the israeli government has breached international law .
another is former foreign ministry state secretary helmut schäfer , who demanded that israel be treated like any other nation that has violated the geneva convention with regard to the protection of civilians .
this is the case with the gaza strip and lebanon . schäfer warned that as germany continues to remain chained to the yoke of its past , it still takes on israel 's perspective as a way to achieve pace in the peace in the middle east .
he added that , should things continue as they are , the german public would no longer see a connection between a historic responsibility due to past events and attitudes toward the current middle east conflict .
dozens of politicians share schäfer 's opinion , yet they belong mainly to the social democratic and opposition parties and not to merkel 's christian democrats . damaging to germany 's interests not only do the views of the majority of the german government 's leaders toward israel 's actions in lebanon differ from those of the german public , they are also damaging germany 's good reputation in the arab world and putting the country 's interests at risk .
these interests seem more important than ever right now , since they not only possess economic but also geographic and historical dimensions . added to that is the continued worsening situation in iraq following the us-british occupation of the country .
at the same time , the us-british orientation of the german government has weakened the eu 's power and is hindering its attempts to define a unified foreign policy toward the middle east , particularly with regard to the israeli-arab conflict . syrian-born ibrahim mohamad is a senior editor for dw-world.de 's arabic web site .
he has more than two decades of experience as a journalist in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should be seen as a fair partner by both sides " dw-world.de spoke to oskar lafontaine of germany 's opposition left party about his take on the middle east conflict , the difficulty of criticizing israel and the possibility of germany aligning too closely with the us .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .

so far , 125 deaths have been confirmed , but further cases are being investigated . in most historical accounts of the berlin wall , it 's stated that well over 200 people died attempting to cross the concrete and barbed wire barrier into west germany .
but that figure may have to be revised downward , at least until a group of researchers in berlin wraps up their two-year investigation aimed at a conclusive answer as to how many people lost their lives between 1961 and 1989 , and under what circumstances they died . taking stock of their progress one year on , researchers from the berlin wall association and the center for contemporary historical research -lrb- zzf -rrb- in potsdam said of the 268 cases of berlin wall deaths under investigation , less than half that number - 125 people - can conclusively be said to have lost their lives due to the wall . the researchers have been able to eliminate 62 cases of suspected berlin wall deaths , while 81 suspected cases still await more thorough investigation . referring to the 62 eliminated cases , maria nooke of the berlin wall association was careful to add that this did n't mean the people were n't still victims of the wall in some way .
in many of the cases , she said , these were people who suffered serious injuries during attempts to flee the gdr , but who ultimately survived . " it is not our job to lower the number of berlin wall victims , " said nooke .
" we are not doing this to diminish the brutality of the east german regime .
rather , each individual story contributes to our picture of the brutality of the regime . " looking for clarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of the berlin wall still fascinate visitors to berlin the 125 confirmed victims - most of whom were young men under the age of 30 - lost their lives in a variety of different circumstances .
most were east germans who were killed while attempting to cross the death zone into west berlin .
however , 24 of the victims were east or west germans who died during incidents at border crossings even though they were not attempting to escape or assist in an escape .
eight incidents where east german border guards were killed while on duty are also included in the 125 cases . hans-hermann hertle from the zzf acknowledged the difficulties involved in documenting the deaths . " the east german state tried to cover up the deaths - there was no list left behind , " he said .
" in west berlin , authorities tried to keep records when they were able to observe an incident , but very often they did n't know the details of what happened . " the result , even years after the fall of the wall , was a patchy list of both confirmed and suspected cases of killings along the berlin wall , filled with mistakes and misinformation . hertle said the research project , supported by a federal grant worth 260,000 euros -lrb- $ 334,000 -rrb- , only became fully possible following the conclusion of the homicide trials of high-ranking east german military officials and border guards .
the last of these trials , intended to bring to justice those responsible for east germany 's shoot-to-kill border policy , ended in 2005 . state prosecutors then handed over their files to the team of researchers , leaving them to painstakingly examine each individual case , comparing whatever records exist , in addition to contacting family members , friends or colleagues , when possible , to fill in the gaps .

the researchers still have a year to complete their project , during which they aim to " reconstruct the individual stories of those who lost their lives at the berlin wall , to rescue them , in some cases , from anonymity , and prevent them from being forgotten , " said gabriele camphausen of the berlin wall association .
the victims ' stories and photographs will be used to compile a register of the dead , which will become part of the permanent exhibition at the berlin wall documentation center located on berlin 's bernauer strasse . camphausen added that public interest and support for the work of the research cooperative is growing again .
immediately after reunification , there was intense interest in clarifying berlin wall deaths , though this waned in the course of the 1990s despite the ongoing presence of the border guard trials in the headlines .

though he said he was unable to predict just how much longer the bloody conflict between israel and hezbollah is going to last , but that there would be no winning side . ' ' a war is always lost because a war is loss of life and destruction .
we 've learned it the hard way in europe , " he said . otte has been touring the middle east for the past three years , developing important contacts and gathering information about how to address the deeply entrenched problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli reservists cross the border from lebanon european union diplomats have made numerous diplomatic excursions to the middle east in attempts to secure an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
however , there is currently no unified position within the bloc as to how the eu can effectively contribute to the peace process .
otte advocates an immediate cessation of hostilities . ' ' it is a unanimous feeling and conviction in the european union that there is no military solution , " he said , though he added that not everyone he met during his travels of the middle east shared this belief . eu working towards resolution in the middle east otte said he attempts in his travels to deliver a message of patience , and pointed to europe 's experience of conflict resolution .
' ' our history shows that resolving conflicts for the long term means cooperation and integration , " he said .
' ' it 's part of our mission , in the external actions of the eu , to offer this model and the tools . "
the european union remains prepared to work together with lebanon , israel , syria and other influential powers , he said , adding that he was sure that after the bombs have stopped falling , european funds would be available for the reconstruction of houses , bridges and infrastructure .
' ' there is an extreme readiness of the europeans to provide the tools to rebuild , the tools to sustain a non military solution as we ’ ve shown in the past , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otte hopes for an agreement between israel and palestine otte said a resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is key to stability in the middle east .
he said the so-called roadmap - the international peace plan that aims for a two-state solution within secure borders - must be put back on the table . " nobody can impose something on others , " he said .
' ' we can act as a guide if we overcome the present crisis in gaza -lsb- and -rsb- there is a good prospect for palestinians of all factions to agree on a program of government acceptable to the international community . " the preconditions for an israeli-palestinian resolution would have to involve the hamas-led palestinian authority recognizing the state of israel , otte said .
in return , israel must returning occupied territories - and not just in the form of separated islands . he did not specify a timeframe in which this should occur , but said the palestinians deserve a certain date by which they could expect change to take place . nathan witkop -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2006 minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to play it extra safe with its nuclear reactors after the breakdown in sweden germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .
the move comes on the heels of reactor closures in sweden due to safety concerns . german environment minister sigmar gabriel said wednesday that following the recent nuclear scare in sweden , all 17 of germany 's nuclear reactors will undergo stringent checks to determine that they are not exposed to risks . " this accident -lrb- in sweden -rrb- shows that there are imminent risks in the system , " gabriel said , adding that the complex system of running nuclear reactors could n't be completely foolproof . " normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown . " the basic problem is that it 's always ' learning by doing . '
i consider that irresponsible when it comes to a security risk , " gabriel said .
" what we 're witnessing here is a normal scenario when you 're using nuclear energy .
unfortunately , this normality is a problem . " the minister said he had absolutely no understanding for operators who want longer life spans for old reactors . " rather you should think about taking old reactors off the power grid , " gabriel said .
" that would contribute towards securing the safety of nuclear plants . " swedish breakdown reignites nuclear debate the minister 's comments come in the wake of a nuclear malfunctioning in sweden recently which has reignited the debate in germany about the use of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the malfunctioning at the forsmark plant sent jitters around europe a reactor in forsmark in sweden was taken off the power grid earlier this month when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started . a former construction manager at the plant said the incident was " close to nuclear meltdown " and that it was sheer luck that it did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .
swedish authorities have since said that the situation was not as dangerous . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , also shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn as precautionary measures . german nuclear power critics used the swedish incident to highlight that atomic power posed dangers - even in a country with western safety standards - and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy .
germany is committed to phasing out nuclear energy and shut down its last nuclear plant by 2020 . no " acute danger " in germany gabriel on wednesday underlined that there was no " acute danger " amid nuclear power plants in germany . " there 's no one-to-one translation of the scenario in sweden , " he said , pointing out that german nuclear reactors used a different technology for emergency power than swedish reactors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" normality is a problem " speaking in berlin after the publication of a report by his ministry , gabriel said he would push for higher safety standards as well as expanding the information system between nuclear plant operators in order to learn better from a breakdown in future . he said that warnings issued by nuclear plants based on the level of danger should in future also contain details about the cause of the breakdown .

while other parts of asia - such as hong kong , mainland china and vietnam - have been able to tackle the disease , the death toll in indonesia continues to rise .
infected poultry flocks have now been found in 27 of the country 's 33 provinces , and even the 44 recorded human fatalities have been spread right across the country .
" we 're doing our best to try to stop this disease , but it seems that our best just is n't good enough , " said bayu krishnamurti , secretary of a national committee set up by the government to fight bird flu .
the reason this failure matters was highlighted earlier this year when seven members of the same family all died of the disease - one of the few suspected human-to-human cases to have been recorded so far .
on this occasion , the lethal h5n1 virus appears not to have mutated into a form more easily transmissible between people - a step which could lead to a global human pandemic .
but the incident raised fears that such a mutation could one day take place , and brought the spotlight on indonesia as the place where it could happen .
lack of co-ordination despite a plethora of negative headlines , the indonesian authorities are slowly gaining some ground in their battle against bird flu .
until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases dick thompson , who according to bayu krishnamurti , the situation was once so bad that four million birds were dying every month , but now fewer than 200,000 are succumbing to the virus .
dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization , added that indonesia had become adept at diagnosing human cases .
but he said that however good the provision for humans was , the disease remained primarily an avian one , and people would continue to contract bird flu as long as it was endemic in poultry .
" until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases , " mr thompson said .
but that is exactly where the problem lies .
how do you ensure that a population of 220 million people , living on 18,000 islands , gets adequate information about prevention measures , and then implements it ?
despite awareness campaigns in the media and even door-to-door visits in some areas , many indonesians remain oblivious to the dangers of being in contact with diseased birds , and aware of the need to inform the authorities and implement a cull .
" some of the people who come here still know nothing about how they contracted bird flu , " said santoso suroso , the director of the sulianti suroso infectious diseases hospital in jakarta , where many patients are taken .
people across this vast archipelago still continue to live in close quarters with birds , he said .
many have chickens in their backyards , and keep caged birds as pets .
quick guide bird flu " we 're trying to advise them to change , of course , but it 's not easy to change a cultural practice .
it takes a long time , " said mr suroso .
as well as getting the message across , indonesia also struggles with making that message a co-ordinated one .
due to its many different separatist struggles and culturally distinct populations , the country has devolved a lot of power away from the central government to the provinces .
while this might be the best solution politically , it makes the job of mounting a country-wide disease control programme extremely difficult .
in late july , vice-president jusuf kalla acknowledged that culling orders sent from jakarta were sometimes simply ignored by the local authorities , who were trying to avoid paying compensation .
" this is dangerous to all of us , " mr kalla said .
" we have a situation where each province - in fact each district - has its own veterinary service .
that 's been one of our biggest concerns , " added peter roeder , a disease control expert with the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- .
worldwide concern indonesia has been criticised internationally for not taking enough concerted action in the fight against bird flu .
indonesian deaths are rising despite government efforts unlike thailand and vietnam , which initiated aggressive culling programmes , at least in the initial stages of the outbreak , indonesia has been reluctant to kill huge swathes of birds .
but mr roeder , who is part of an fao team working with the jakarta government to combat bird flu , believes that a lot of this blame is unfair .
" widespread culling is not the right approach .
it would alienate the communities you 're trying to help , and the cost is prohibitive .
it 's better to cull infected birds and those in the immediate vicinity , then concentrate on vaccination , " he said .
" it 's having a systematic method that 's key - you need to implement it across the board . "
mr roeder estimates that $ 50m is needed over the next three years to develop such a programme .
" clearing this up will take a long time , " he said .
but the international community has been slow to come up with the funds , and indonesian officials readily admit they need more outside help .
" we 've faced many other disasters recently , like the tsunami and the earthquake in yogyakarta .
we 're already being squeezed in terms of resources , " said bayu krishnamurti .
while the world may criticise indonesia for its handling of bird flu , the fact remains that unless the funds are available to tackle this disease head-on , it could well spread beyond the country 's borders .
as mr krishnamurti succinctly put it : " actually , this is not just indonesia 's problem . "

while this might be the best solution politically , it makes the job of mounting a country-wide disease control programme extremely difficult .
in late july , vice-president jusuf kalla acknowledged that culling orders sent from jakarta were sometimes simply ignored by the local authorities , who were trying to avoid paying compensation .
" this is dangerous to all of us , " mr kalla said .
" we have a situation where each province - in fact each district - has its own veterinary service .
that 's been one of our biggest concerns , " added peter roeder , a disease control expert with the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- .
worldwide concern indonesia has been criticised internationally for not taking enough concerted action in the fight against bird flu .
indonesian deaths are rising despite government efforts unlike thailand and vietnam , which initiated aggressive culling programmes , at least in the initial stages of the outbreak , indonesia has been reluctant to kill huge swathes of birds .
but mr roeder , who is part of an fao team working with the jakarta government to combat bird flu , believes that a lot of this blame is unfair .
" widespread culling is not the right approach .
it would alienate the communities you 're trying to help , and the cost is prohibitive .
it 's better to cull infected birds and those in the immediate vicinity , then concentrate on vaccination , " he said .
" it 's having a systematic method that 's key - you need to implement it across the board . "
mr roeder estimates that $ 50m is needed over the next three years to develop such a programme .
" clearing this up will take a long time , " he said .
but the international community has been slow to come up with the funds , and indonesian officials readily admit they need more outside help .
" we 've faced many other disasters recently , like the tsunami and the earthquake in yogyakarta .
we 're already being squeezed in terms of resources , " said bayu krishnamurti .
while the world may criticise indonesia for its handling of bird flu , the fact remains that unless the funds are available to tackle this disease head-on , it could well spread beyond the country 's borders .
as mr krishnamurti succinctly put it : " actually , this is not just indonesia 's problem . "

while other parts of asia - such as hong kong , mainland china and vietnam - have been able to tackle the disease , the death toll in indonesia continues to rise .
infected poultry flocks have now been found in 27 of the country 's 33 provinces , and even the 44 recorded human fatalities have been spread right across the country .
" we 're doing our best to try to stop this disease , but it seems that our best just is n't good enough , " said bayu krishnamurti , secretary of a national committee set up by the government to fight bird flu .
the reason this failure matters was highlighted earlier this year when seven members of the same family all died of the disease - one of the few suspected human-to-human cases to have been recorded so far .
on this occasion , the lethal h5n1 virus appears not to have mutated into a form more easily transmissible between people - a step which could lead to a global human pandemic .
but the incident raised fears that such a mutation could one day take place , and brought the spotlight on indonesia as the place where it could happen .
lack of co-ordination despite a plethora of negative headlines , the indonesian authorities are slowly gaining some ground in their battle against bird flu .
until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases dick thompson , who according to bayu krishnamurti , the situation was once so bad that four million birds were dying every month , but now fewer than 200,000 are succumbing to the virus .
dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization , added that indonesia had become adept at diagnosing human cases .
but he said that however good the provision for humans was , the disease remained primarily an avian one , and people would continue to contract bird flu as long as it was endemic in poultry .
" until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases , " mr thompson said .
but that is exactly where the problem lies .
how do you ensure that a population of 220 million people , living on 18,000 islands , gets adequate information about prevention measures , and then implements it ?
despite awareness campaigns in the media and even door-to-door visits in some areas , many indonesians remain oblivious to the dangers of being in contact with diseased birds , and aware of the need to inform the authorities and implement a cull .
" some of the people who come here still know nothing about how they contracted bird flu , " said santoso suroso , the director of the sulianti suroso infectious diseases hospital in jakarta , where many patients are taken .
people across this vast archipelago still continue to live in close quarters with birds , he said .
many have chickens in their backyards , and keep caged birds as pets .
quick guide bird flu " we 're trying to advise them to change , of course , but it 's not easy to change a cultural practice .
it takes a long time , " said mr suroso .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- bird flu fears focus on indonesia bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 9 august 2006 , 05:41 gmt 06:41 uk bird flu fears focus on indonesia by kate mcgeown bbc news the news that indonesia is now the country worst affected by bird flu will come as little surprise to many analysts .
while other parts of asia - such as hong kong , mainland china and vietnam - have been able to tackle the disease , the death toll in indonesia continues to rise .
infected poultry flocks have now been found in 27 of the country 's 33 provinces , and even the 44 recorded human fatalities have been spread right across the country .
" we 're doing our best to try to stop this disease , but it seems that our best just is n't good enough , " said bayu krishnamurti , secretary of a national committee set up by the government to fight bird flu .
the reason this failure matters was highlighted earlier this year when seven members of the same family all died of the disease - one of the few suspected human-to-human cases to have been recorded so far .
on this occasion , the lethal h5n1 virus appears not to have mutated into a form more easily transmissible between people - a step which could lead to a global human pandemic .
but the incident raised fears that such a mutation could one day take place , and brought the spotlight on indonesia as the place where it could happen .
lack of co-ordination despite a plethora of negative headlines , the indonesian authorities are slowly gaining some ground in their battle against bird flu . "
until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases " dick thompson , who according to bayu krishnamurti , the situation was once so bad that four million birds were dying every month , but now fewer than 200,000 are succumbing to the virus .
dick thompson , a spokesman for the world health organization , added that indonesia had become adept at diagnosing human cases .
but he said that however good the provision for humans was , the disease remained primarily an avian one , and people would continue to contract bird flu as long as it was endemic in poultry .
" until the animal situation is under control , we 'll continue to see human cases , " mr thompson said .
but that is exactly where the problem lies .
how do you ensure that a population of 220 million people , living on 18,000 islands , gets adequate information about prevention measures , and then implements it ?
despite awareness campaigns in the media and even door-to-door visits in some areas , many indonesians remain oblivious to the dangers of being in contact with diseased birds , and aware of the need to inform the authorities and implement a cull .
" some of the people who come here still know nothing about how they contracted bird flu , " said santoso suroso , the director of the sulianti suroso infectious diseases hospital in jakarta , where many patients are taken .
people across this vast archipelago still continue to live in close quarters with birds , he said .
many have chickens in their backyards , and keep caged birds as pets .
" we 're trying to advise them to change , of course , but it 's not easy to change a cultural practice .
it takes a long time , " said mr suroso .
as well as getting the message across , indonesia also struggles with making that message a co-ordinated one .
due to its many different separatist struggles and culturally distinct populations , the country has devolved a lot of power away from the central government to the provinces .
while this might be the best solution politically , it makes the job of mounting a country-wide disease control programme extremely difficult .
in late july , vice-president jusuf kalla acknowledged that culling orders sent from jakarta were sometimes simply ignored by the local authorities , who were trying to avoid paying compensation .
" this is dangerous to all of us , " mr kalla said .
" we have a situation where each province - in fact each district - has its own veterinary service .
that 's been one of our biggest concerns , " added peter roeder , a disease control expert with the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- .
worldwide concern indonesia has been criticised internationally for not taking enough concerted action in the fight against bird flu .
unlike thailand and vietnam , which initiated aggressive culling programmes , at least in the initial stages of the outbreak , indonesia has been reluctant to kill huge swathes of birds .
but mr roeder , who is part of an fao team working with the jakarta government to combat bird flu , believes that a lot of this blame is unfair .
" widespread culling is not the right approach .
it would alienate the communities you 're trying to help , and the cost is prohibitive .
it 's better to cull infected birds and those in the immediate vicinity , then concentrate on vaccination , " he said .
" it 's having a systematic method that 's key - you need to implement it across the board . "
mr roeder estimates that $ 50m is needed over the next three years to develop such a programme .
" clearing this up will take a long time , " he said .
but the international community has been slow to come up with the funds , and indonesian officials readily admit they need more outside help .
" we 've faced many other disasters recently , like the tsunami and the earthquake in yogyakarta .
we 're already being squeezed in terms of resources , " said bayu krishnamurti .
while the world may criticise indonesia for its handling of bird flu , the fact remains that unless the funds are available to tackle this disease head-on , it could well spread beyond the country 's borders .
as mr krishnamurti succinctly put it : " actually , this is not just indonesia 's problem . "

breanne loucks , 18 , is now back in wales after playing in the curtis cup in oregon , usa , last week .
although the usa won the cup , breanne won all three of her matches for the great britain and ireland team .
she plans to turn professional in the next few years and hopes to compete regularly against the world 's best .
the biennial curtis cup clash between great britain and ireland and the united states is considered the pinnacle of women 's amateur golf .
and although the americans convincingly won the competition 11 points to six , breanne won all three of her games .
breanne said : " it 's the highest achievement as an amateur golfer as a lady you can get .
" i 've enjoyed it so much , it 's a great experience . "
i 've got loads of time .
some people do n't turn pro until their late 20s " breanne loucks " i won three out of three points .
i won quite decently . "
achieving so much at such a young age means breanne is already being tipped as a future star .
but she has vowed to keep her feet on the ground , and is in no rush to turn professional - yet .
she said : " my plans are to stay amateur for next year .
a lot of people have been asking if i 'm turning pro yet , but no .
" i 've decided to stay with it for another year , and maybe stay on for another curtis cup , i 'm not sure yet .
" i want to win a couple of competitions yet . "
she added : " hopefully this confidence is going to bring me to bigger and better things and hopefully win a couple of competitions which is my goal for next year .
" you need that before you turn pro , to know that you can do it .
" i 've got loads of time .
some people do n't turn pro until their late 20s .
but i think in the next couple of years i 'll definitely be ready for it . "
breanne started playing golf when she was around nine years old , and was selected for the welsh championships by the age of nine .
she plays nearly every day and tries to put in at least two hours of practice each time .
paul williams , golf professional at wrexham golf club , and breanne 's coach , said the club was delighted at her curtis cup selection .
he added : " it 's always been a dream of hers , she 's seen a lot of big names there .
" you 've got to have your dreams and work towards those goals .
she 's just gone from strength to strength .
" it 's been thoroughly deserved , she worked so hard . "

the regulators in ni and the irish republic had initially set 1 july next year as the start date for wholesale electricity trading .
the all-island move is expected to reduce power generation costs .
announcing the delay , ni secretary peter hain said it was " essential that we get it absolutely right " .
" this is a groundbreaking arrangement between northern ireland and the republic of ireland that will create a single wholesale electricity market across two jurisdictions , " he said .
" the new single electricity market is the first of its kind in the european union and will be a flagship development in the european drive towards a common energy market . "

in the last four years , there have been three changes in management at parc - a fact that the prison reform trust blames for parc 's failings .
despite the findings , prison inspectors said the jail was in recovery .
the prison , run by securicor , provides over 1,000 places for adults , young offenders and non-convicted juveniles .
it failed to meet tests on a number of issues including safety and prisoner work activity .
' inadequate training ' juliet lyon from prison reform trust said : " having seen a high number of directors in a comparatively short time will have made it very inconsistent and unstable . "
she said a report by the council for racial equality -lrb- cre -rrb- in 2003 had identified problems with racism directed at both staff and inmates , and it appeared not much had changed .
" there has n't been an action plan to respond to the cre despite the fact that the report was a while ago , " she told bbc wales .
" there was certainly inadequate training for staff on race relations .
" no particular effort to recruit black and ethnic minority staff , and black and ethnic minority prisoners in particular feeling very much more that they were likely to be subjected to abuse and ill-treatment than white prisoners .
" this racism appears to be quite endemic and has to be rooted out . "
chief inspector of prisons anne owers said although there were a number of concerning elements found at parc , she recognised moves were being made to address the problems .
among some of the concerns raised were : lack of engagement between officers and prisoners no action plan to deal with a critical report from a racial equality investigation little work skills training on offer to prisoners despite many being allowed out of their cells for 11 hours a day the lack of a visitors ' centre lack of activities for young adult prisoners -lrb- 18-21 -rrb- management and support gaps for prisoners at risk of self-harm or suicide education provision in the juvenile unit was inadequate however , she said inspectors found parc staff used relatively low levels of force and segregation .
inspectors were pleased to find real progress in resettlement of offenders .
the report also found the juvenile unit was well run and focused on the needs of young people .
" though this was a disappointing inspection , we were clear that the prison was moving forward under a new director , " said ms owers .
the prison has had three managers in four years " the pockets of good practice show what can be achieved , given motivation , leadership and resources .
" but it is of some concern that securicor , who managed the prison , and the office for contracted prisons , had not taken decisive action earlier to halt and reverse the drift downwards .
" parc can be a significant resource for wales , but its role needs to be clarified , and its contract examined to ensure that it provides the right incentives and sufficient resources for that role . "
she urged the new director of offender management for wales to urgently oversee that task .
sian west , acting director of offender management for wales , responded : " i am satisfied that the report is a fair and accurate reflection of parc prison at the time the inspection took place . "
jerry knight , custody and rehabilitation director for group 4 securicor justice services , said : " we have taken various steps to action the recommendations in the report to ensure that the continued improvement of hmp & yoi parc is sustained .
" the report acknowledges that solid foundations are in place at parc to sustain performance improvements in the future . "

both companies have enjoyed packed houses , winning new fans and rewarding old ones .
critical opinion has largely favoured moscow 's bolshoi while devotees of st petersburg 's mariinsky may feel bewildered by some of the comment in the british press .
" the reviews did n't represent what the audiences saw , " says paul cardwell , from the uk-based mariinsky theatre trust 's board of directors .
he admits a season devoted to dmitri shostakovich - a soviet composer not known for his ballet music - was always going to be difficult but he feels the critics could have been fairer .
" look at the bedbug ballet , for instance - this was very anarchic , satirical stuff with some real little britain-style humour and political criticism , " he says .
nazis and opium some people may have been as baffled by the plot as much as the satirical intent of the bedbug , based on a 1929 play , though the bawdy humour and futuristic costumes were enjoyable .
however , the two other pieces on the same triple bill made it a unique evening in london .
the young lady and the hooligan evokes a time and place unfamiliar to western audiences , the criminal underworld of pre-war leningrad -lrb- as st petersburg was then known -rrb- .
every step and gesture of igor zelensky as the hooligan conveyed passion , from bravado to enraptured surrender before the delicacy of svetlana ivanova 's young lady .
leningrad symphony , the triple bill 's closing ballet , portrayed the war against hitler , complete with a brown-clad nazi corps de ballet swaggering and saluting .
the bolshoi rescued the " opium dream " ballet the pharaoh 's daughter - one of the 19th century 's most spectacular and sensational ballets - from obscurity .
marius petipa 's 1862 original played on europeans ' fascination with oriental exotica while experimenting with every trick of stage mechanics offered by the industrial revolution .
tortured soul though scaled down and rechoreographed , the new bolshoi production is crammed full of costumes , dance movements and scene changes .
maria alexandrova , dancing the role of ramze with astonishing lightness , literally took the covent garden audience 's breath away .
the mariinsky 's operas revealed that shostakovich was more than just a tortured soul on a political tightrope .
his first opera , the nose , is a no-holds-barred adaptation of gogol 's satirical tale of lost social status .
composed when shostakovich was just 22 , it is a testosterone-driven madcap gallop , compared at its 1930 premiere to " an anarchist 's hand grenade " .
the mariinsky 's current production went off like an artillery barrage , with a huge battery of percussion instruments .
the bolshoi began its opera offering with the fiery angel , one of prokofiev 's most problematical works .
the heroine renata is in a perpetual state of hysteria and the rare scenes without her come almost as a relief .
fresh interest still , it was fascinating to be able to see within the space of only a few days what the exiled prokofiev was working on at almost exactly the same time as his compatriot shostakovich was occupied with the nose .
the bolshoi has been doing exceptionally well at the box office this mid-summer , according to its london press officer , faith wilson .
she says the pharaoh 's daughter received almost unanimously good reviews and even its familiar production of swan lake seems to have been welcomed back by the critics .
with all performances sold out , it certainly seems to have cast its old spell on the public again .
lovers of the mariinsky may smart at critics who found " sentimental guff " in its hooligan -lrb- the observer -rrb- or " risible staging " in the nose -lrb- the independent -rrb- but the season actually did " really well " , according to mr cardwell .
he is confident it has attracted fresh interest in the company 's work .
" interest hopefully followed by dinners and cheques ! " says mr cardwell .
the mariinsky 's london season has ended but the bolshoi continues at the royal opera house covent garden until 19 august .

day-by-day : week one day-by-day : week two day-by-day : week three tuesday 8 august israeli prime minister ehud olmert calls beirut 's plan to send 15,000 troops to the south if israel withdraws an " interesting step " which israel will examine .
the united nations abandons an attempt to get an aid convoy into southern lebanon , after israel said any moving vehicle in the zone south of the litani river would be destroyed .

labour mp rosie cooper reportedly raised the issue after she understood civil servants in the cabinet office were drawing up plans for the occasion .
the daily telegraph says tony blair 's political secretary replied , saying " there are no such plans " .
senior tories claim the stance is an appeasement to left-wing labour mps .
' contemptible ' according to the paper , miss cooper , mp for lancashire west , wrote to number 10 saying some of her constituents were " appalled " by the idea that lady thatcher , britain 's first female prime minister , should be accorded such an honour .
john mcternan , mr blair 's political secretary , said he could confirm there were no such plans and hoped " that this reply reassures your constituents " . "
margaret thatcher was one of britain 's greatest prime ministers and she remains in good health " david cameron 's spokesman a spokesman for number 10 said : " it is not appropriate to start speculating or discussing it in any way . "
but gerald howarth , lady thatcher 's former parliamentary aide and a tory mp , told the telegraph : " that is blair all over .

conservative leader david cameron 's spokesman said : " margaret thatcher was one of britain 's greatest prime ministers and she remains in good health . "
miss cooper told the paper she was surprised by the reaction from tory mps to downing street 's remarks .
she said that although lady thatcher had been a long-serving prime minister , she was not of the stature of winston churchill , who led the country through the second world war .
' great war leader ' " there is still a negative reaction to lady thatcher in the north of england , " she said .
" her policies had a dramatic impact on life in the north .
she is not revered in the areas which suffered most during her tenure . "
lady thatcher became prime minister in may 1979 and went on to spend 11 years at number 10 , a record unmatched in the 20th century .
churchill died aged 90 on 24 january 1965 and a state funeral was held at st paul 's cathedral a week later to honour his life as a great war leader .
his body travelled on a gun carriage from waterloo station to st paul 's cathedral where it was borne up the steps by officers from the grenadier guards .
a precedent had been set in 1852 , with the lavish state funeral of the duke of wellington .
these apart , the term " state funeral " has been reserved for reigning kings and queens .

the campaign to protect rural england criticised 13 councils for building less than a third of new homes on previously developed brownfield land .
these include milton keynes , harlow and corby , which was labelled " england 's worst recycler " .
corby borough council dismissed the report as misleading due to an anomaly in the government 's classification .
the council said most of the new homes in the area were being built in two former quarries which were not classified as brownfield .
chris mallender , the council 's chief executive , said : " what we 're doing with local support is building new housing where these limestone quarries stood in preference to building on amenity green space or very valuable ancient woodland in the centre of corby . "
worst councils for recycled land 2001-2004 ashford 33 % rugby 30 % boston 28 % harlow 23 % milton keynes 13 % corby 9 % source : cpre ' brownfield sites confusion ' but nick schoon from the cpre told the bbc the categorisation of quarries should not be changed .
he said : " the fact is if every quarry in the country was considered a brownfield site - a lot of these quarries are in very rural areas , a lot of them in national parks - and if these were legitimate sites to build new homes on we 'd have a pretty changed countryside and a real problem on our hands i think . "
residential gardens also qualify as brownfield sites and some councils admit they been used for development when land is limited .
' land recycling heroes ' the crpe also identified 15 councils , like brentwood and watford , which achieved a land recycling level of at least 95 % between 2001 and 2004 .
this means that less than one new home in every 20 was built on a greenfield site , land which has never been developed .
during 2001-2004 , all homes built in watford were on brownfield land .
top councils for recycled land 2001-2004 watford 100 % ewell 99 % bournemouth 98 % sandwell 97 % surrey heath 96 % wolverhampton 95 % source : cpre chris pagdin , watford borough council 's head of planning and development , said : " we are very much an urban borough which means there is n't much green land to use .
" nevertheless we work hard , in partnership with developers , to ensure that brownfield land is used as fully as possible to meet our housing requirements . "
although most councils improved the amount of land they recycled between 1997-2000 and 2001-2004 , 11 were able to more than double their performance .
worcester improved the most during this time , increasing the amount of recycled land from 25 % to 92 % .
henry oliver , the cpre 's head of planning and local government , said : " we 're delighted that there has been such strong progress across the country by council planners and developers in raising the level of land recycling and getting away from wastefully low densities for new housing .
" these improvements have saved thousands of acres of countryside from being built on each year - even though the number of new homes being built has been growing . "

the campaign to protect rural england criticised 13 councils for building less than a third of new homes on previously developed brownfield land .
these include milton keynes , harlow and corby , which was labelled " england 's worst recycler " .
corby borough council dismissed the report as misleading due to an anomaly in the government 's classification .
the council said most of the new homes in the area were being built in two former quarries which were not classified as brownfield .
chris mallender , the council 's chief executive , said : " what we 're doing with local support is building new housing where these limestone quarries stood in preference to building on amenity green space or very valuable ancient woodland in the centre of corby . "
worst councils for recycled land 2001-2004 ashford 33 % rugby 30 % boston 28 % harlow 23 % milton keynes 13 % corby 9 % source : cpre ' brownfield sites confusion ' but nick schoon from the cpre told the bbc the categorisation of quarries should not be changed .
he said : " the fact is if every quarry in the country was considered a brownfield site - a lot of these quarries are in very rural areas , a lot of them in national parks - and if these were legitimate sites to build new homes on we 'd have a pretty changed countryside and a real problem on our hands i think . "
residential gardens also qualify as brownfield sites and some councils admit they been used for development when land is limited .
' land recycling heroes ' the crpe also identified 15 councils , like brentwood and watford , which achieved a land recycling level of at least 95 % between 2001 and 2004 .
this means that less than one new home in every 20 was built on a greenfield site , land which has never been developed .
during 2001-2004 , all homes built in watford were on brownfield land .
top councils for recycled land 2001-2004 watford 100 % ewell 99 % bournemouth 98 % sandwell 97 % surrey heath 96 % wolverhampton 95 % source : cpre chris pagdin , watford borough council 's head of planning and development , said : " we are very much an urban borough which means there is n't much green land to use .
" nevertheless we work hard , in partnership with developers , to ensure that brownfield land is used as fully as possible to meet our housing requirements . "
although most councils improved the amount of land they recycled between 1997-2000 and 2001-2004 , 11 were able to more than double their performance .
corby council has built housing on this restored ironstone quarry worcester improved the most during this time , increasing the amount of recycled land from 25 % to 92 % .
