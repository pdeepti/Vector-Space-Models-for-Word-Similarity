" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .

government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .

" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question .

hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

" the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question .

hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 28.11.2006 appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer received a jail term after confessing in 2005 former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

but do n't get it confused with deodorant , nasal spray or oven cleaner . masculan , goliath , pullitt … the names may vary , but traditional condoms all had one thing in common .
someone had to fish them out of the package and put them on .

there 's no need to worry about spray-on condoms being damaged by rough transport or excessive sunlight , they 're quick on the draw , and their size matches each individual user 's specific physiognomy . " no slippage , no pinching , just pure fun , " krause wrote . the condom consists of a mixture of natural rubber and water and is applied by using what looked like a normal aerosol can .
the rubber and water vulcanize at room temperature .
and the company claims that after usage the rubber then breaks down into humus , easing the sometimes awkward issue of post-coital disposal . career opportunities last year the chinese brought out what was claimed to be the world 's first aerosol condom , but it was for women , whereas vinico 's product is , um , aimed at men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun with aeresol courtesy of german entrepreneurs it 's currently undergoing tests to determine whether it 's safe , and in what sounds like an instance of adolescent male wish-fulfillment , the company is looking for people who are willing to try out the spray .
men whose anatomy falls at the extreme short or long end of the physical spectrum are particularly encouraged to apply . applications are anonymous .
kraus hopes the test results will be positive enough that spray-on condoms can hit the market in the summer of 2008 . for prospective guinea pigs who are unsure whether they fit the physical profile , the web site offers a size guide and a virtual tape measure . if this is not just a hoax , the world of bumps and studs , banana flavors and strawberry scents , may be just a few steps away from becoming one curiosity richer .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 28.11.2006 appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer received a jail term after confessing in 2005 former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

someone had to fish them out of the package and put them on .

there 's no need to worry about spray-on condoms being damaged by rough transport or excessive sunlight , they 're quick on the draw , and their size matches each individual user 's specific physiognomy . " no slippage , no pinching , just pure fun , " krause wrote . the condom consists of a mixture of natural rubber and water and is applied by using what looked like a normal aerosol can .
the rubber and water vulcanize at room temperature .
and the company claims that after usage the rubber then breaks down into humus , easing the sometimes awkward issue of post-coital disposal . career opportunities last year the chinese brought out what was claimed to be the world 's first aerosol condom , but it was for women , whereas vinico 's product is , um , aimed at men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun with aeresol courtesy of german entrepreneurs it 's currently undergoing tests to determine whether it 's safe , and in what sounds like an instance of adolescent male wish-fulfillment , the company is looking for people who are willing to try out the spray .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.11.2006 germany in " sustainable recovery " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will need a bigger cart to satisfy their current shopping urges consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .
but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial .

but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question .

hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .

hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

there 's no need to worry about spray-on condoms being damaged by rough transport or excessive sunlight , they 're quick on the draw , and their size matches each individual user 's specific physiognomy . " no slippage , no pinching , just pure fun , " krause wrote . the condom consists of a mixture of natural rubber and water and is applied by using what looked like a normal aerosol can .
the rubber and water vulcanize at room temperature .
and the company claims that after usage the rubber then breaks down into humus , easing the sometimes awkward issue of post-coital disposal . career opportunities last year the chinese brought out what was claimed to be the world 's first aerosol condom , but it was for women , whereas vinico 's product is , um , aimed at men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun with aeresol courtesy of german entrepreneurs it 's currently undergoing tests to determine whether it 's safe , and in what sounds like an instance of adolescent male wish-fulfillment , the company is looking for people who are willing to try out the spray .
men whose anatomy falls at the extreme short or long end of the physical spectrum are particularly encouraged to apply . applications are anonymous .
kraus hopes the test results will be positive enough that spray-on condoms can hit the market in the summer of 2008 . for prospective guinea pigs who are unsure whether they fit the physical profile , the web site offers a size guide and a virtual tape measure . if this is not just a hoax , the world of bumps and studs , banana flavors and strawberry scents , may be just a few steps away from becoming one curiosity richer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.11.2006 germany in " sustainable recovery " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will need a bigger cart to satisfy their current shopping urges consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .
but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam .

in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

but do n't get it confused with deodorant , nasal spray or oven cleaner . masculan , goliath , pullitt … the names may vary , but traditional condoms all had one thing in common .
someone had to fish them out of the package and put them on .

there 's no need to worry about spray-on condoms being damaged by rough transport or excessive sunlight , they 're quick on the draw , and their size matches each individual user 's specific physiognomy . " no slippage , no pinching , just pure fun , " krause wrote . the condom consists of a mixture of natural rubber and water and is applied by using what looked like a normal aerosol can .
the rubber and water vulcanize at room temperature .
and the company claims that after usage the rubber then breaks down into humus , easing the sometimes awkward issue of post-coital disposal . career opportunities last year the chinese brought out what was claimed to be the world 's first aerosol condom , but it was for women , whereas vinico 's product is , um , aimed at men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun with aeresol courtesy of german entrepreneurs it 's currently undergoing tests to determine whether it 's safe , and in what sounds like an instance of adolescent male wish-fulfillment , the company is looking for people who are willing to try out the spray .

kraus hopes the test results will be positive enough that spray-on condoms can hit the market in the summer of 2008 . for prospective guinea pigs who are unsure whether they fit the physical profile , the web site offers a size guide and a virtual tape measure . if this is not just a hoax , the world of bumps and studs , banana flavors and strawberry scents , may be just a few steps away from becoming one curiosity richer .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history .

" ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.11.2006 germany in " sustainable recovery " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will need a bigger cart to satisfy their current shopping urges consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .
but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial .

but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .

paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question .

hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor .

" 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam .

turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

" we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 28.11.2006 pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether the pope 's visit will have a positive impact on religious dialog has yet to be seen pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence . the pope , in a striking reversal of opinion , said on tuesday that he backed turkey 's bid to join the european union . " we want turkey to be part of the eu , " erdogan quoted benedict xvi as telling him .
erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam . " the goal of this trip is dialog , fraternity , a commitment to understanding and dialog between cultures , to a meeting of cultures and religions in favor of reconciliation , " the pope told reporters on the flight from rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will spend four days in turkey the trip is a controversial one in turkey , amid residual anger over the september comments that triggered widespread outrage in the muslim world . in addition , the pontiff , seen as a defender of europe 's christian identity , had already been dubbed the " anti-turkish pope " for saying , when he was still joseph cardinal ratzinger , that eu membership for ankara would be " a grave error against the tide of history . " erdogan had initially refused to meet the pope , pleading prior commitments .
a pastoral and political visit the two spoke briefly at the airport vip lounge under heavy security before erdogan headed for a nato summit in riga and benedict xvi went on the first stop of his tour , a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern turkey . benedict signed a visitors ' book at the monument , writing : " on this land , meeting place and crossroads of different religions and cultures , junction of asia and europe , i am pleased to adopt the words of the founder of the turkish republic as my own in expressing this wish : ' peace at home , peace in the world . " ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "
he gave assurances that the pope would be well received and criticized islamist and nationalist groups in turkey that opposed the papal visit as " marginal , specific and narrow . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit was preceded by protests the pope 's four-day visit is taking place under strict security , tighter than that laid out for us president george w. bush when he visited during a 2004 nato summit , according to foreign minister abdullah gül . the pope 's stop in the turkish capital will be purely political , with secular officialdom greeting him as the vatican head of state rather than the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics . later tuesday the pope went to the presidential palace for an official welcome and a private meeting with president ahmet necdet sezer .
turkish press hopeful the 79-year-old pontiff will then visit ali bardakoglu , the director of religious affairs and secular turkey 's top religious official , who had harsh words for him after the pope 's sept .
12 remarks on islam in regensburg , germany .
bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .
he then heads to istanbul to meet patriarch bartholomew i , head of the greek orthodox church - initially the main purpose of the trip to turkey . in istanbul on tuesday , the ecumenical orthodox patriarchate said it hoped the pope 's visit would help convince ankara to enhance the rights of its followers , who are a tiny minority here . the church , seated in istanbul since byzantine times , and bartholomew i are encountering " some difficulties , to say the least , " archbishop demetrios of america told a news conference . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

" 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

the eu presidency said on monday the impasse was insurmountable . " the row has a history in which turkey is not the villain , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
" it was the greek cypriots who rejected reunification with the northern part of the island in 2004 - in the knowledge that as an existing eu member they would n't suffer any disadvantages from doing so .
turkey , on the other hand , can not join up without approval from the greek cypriots .
it would thus be unfair and inappropriate now to allow the negotiations to fail due to the cyprus issue . lüneburg 's landeszeitung newspaper expressed similar sentiments : " the eu integration of turkey hangs in the balance because the newcomer does n't want to play by the rules and the club applies double standards .
thus , the eu lets the greek cypriots get away with their insistence on the embargo on the turkish cypriots .
it 's right that turkey as an accession candidate must recognize all members .
turkey is still not ripe for eu accession - but it is for negotiations .
a suspension would jeopardize the project which has global dimensions : the reconciliation of islam and democracy and the upgrading of the eu to a world power . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erogan -lrb- l . -rrb- and eu leader barroso are n't smiling now " is turkey still interesting ? " asked the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung from essen .
" ankara keeps its ports closed to goods from the greek-cypriot south .
in spite of the republic of cyprus being a member of the eu , and the eu and turkey being in the midst of clear trade agreements .
government leader erdogan does a disservice to turkish aspirations when , in order to please nationalists , he puts domestic political motives above the european perspective .
in any case , turkey 's enthusiasm for europe has faded .
it 's possible that the widespread anti-europe sentiment is a result , not least , of remarkable growth : that one no longer needs the eu as an engine for the economy . " " the eu has allowed turkey to make it look like a fool long enough , " according to berlin 's die welt .
" appeals , warnings , threats - all these maneuvers from the european diplomats ' tool box have accomplished nothing on the bosporus .
at most , they have incited the anger of many eu citizens toward a pliable expansion policy that has repeatedly opened a loophole for the candidate .
that weighs heavy .
the issue is not just turkey 's refusal to open ports to eu member cyprus .
it 's also that when it comes to implementing reformed legislation from the summer of 2002 , ankara has not made any more real progress in a year .
without acting consistently , european institutions will continue to lose credibility .
the eu does n't need turkey . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's last-ditch talks with turkey over cyprus fail last-ditch talks in finland on monday between the european union and turkey aimed at averting an eu crisis with ankara over the cyprus issue have failed , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .

the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 28.11.2006 appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer received a jail term after confessing in 2005 former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam .

erdogan himself made a conciliatory gesture by personally greeting the pope as he stepped off his alitalia plane at ankara 's esenboga airport , defying protocol that normally would have a minister of state serve this function . the pope described his high-stakes visit - his first to a muslim country since his election in april 2005 - as an opportunity for " reconciliation " between christianity and islam .

" ' erdogan , addressing his justice and development party 's group in parliament earlier tuesday , said the pope 's visit would contribute to " the alliance of civilizations and global peace . "

bardakoglu had accused benedict xvi of harboring " hatred in his heart " for muslims and said in an interview monday that the visit , although " a step in the right direction , " would not suffice to heal the hurt his comments had caused . tuesday 's turkish press was largely hopeful that the pope would succeed in building bridges and that turkey would put its best foot forward in its bid to join the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff also wants to foster better relations between the orthodox and catholics the pontiff heads for more familiar religious ground on wednesday , flying to ephesus in western turkey , to say mass at the location where the virgin mary is believed to have spent her last days .

but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense . a federal appeals court in leipzig was expected to rule on the hoyzer case on tuesday , but the court has now decided to wait until dec .
15 , after the state prosecutor hartmut schneider surprisingly said that the disgraced soccer referee 's conviction should be overturned . last year , a lower court in berlin sentenced hoyzer to almost two-and-a-half years in prison .
the german soccer association , the dfb , also banned hoyzer for life from the sport after he admitted to conspiring to fix matches in the german cup and in the bundesliga 's lower divisions . common trickery not illegal hoyzer was convicted along with several others of being an accessory to fraud , but prosecutor schneider argues that what hoyzer did does not technically qualify as fraud . " it 's an instance of common trickery , " schneider said , " but there 's no way we can criminally prosecute it . " schneider cited the precedent of a man who was accused of fraud in 1961 after placing lightning-quick bets on horse races whose outcomes he already knew .
the man was found innocent .
" that 's why i came to conclusion in this case that their convictions should be overturned , " added schneider . the judge was highly critical of the berlin court that convicted hoyzer last november , calling its verdict " remarkably superficial . " 40 pages of small print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg pointed the finger at hoyzer for their early exit from the german cup it may seem extraordinary that a conviction could be overturned in a case that might appear open and shut to laymen .
but asking prosecutors to look over the judicial logic of convictions is a basic element of the german legal system . " a state prosecutor is always asked to review appeal cases , " berlin-based criminal lawyer barbara petersen told dw-online .
" and while it 's rare that one should ask for a guilty verdict to be overturned , it has happened in the past . " the fact that hoyzer was convicted of fraud also opened up a range of legal questions . " fraud is one of the most complicated corpus delicti that we have , " petersen said .
" there are more than 40 small-print pages of commentary in the criminal code qualifying what it is .
this case is also quite out of the ordinary , so it 's no wonder that there are so many opportunities to call the verdict into question . " in other words , although hoyzer acted dishonestly , it 's not clear from a legal perspective precisely whom he defrauded - and that could be the basis for a not-guilty verdict . strange penalties and bizarre red cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer whistled dishonestly , but cheating is n't necessarily fraud hoyzer attracted the negative attention of soccer fans and investigators alike after refereeing a german cup match between first-division hamburg and third-division paderborn in august 2004 .
hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties to the underdogs and sent one of hamburg 's players off with a disputed red card .
paderborn went on to win the match 4-2 . in early 2005 , while under investigation , hoyzer admitted to conspiring to fix that and other matches in conjunction with a ring of gamblers who had placed large bets on the unlikely outcomes . his confession sparked outrage among fans and fears among the sport 's functionaries that the image of german soccer had been badly tarnished ahead of the 2006 world cup . defense went home happy but hoyzer 's defense lawyers have argued that while their client 's decisions on the pitch may not have been on the up-and-up , there was no way he could guarantee a specific match result and thus he did not technically " fix " matches . hoyzer 's defense team was delighted with the course of tuesday 's proceedings . " the court showed that it was skeptical , " lawyer thomas hermes said .
" we hope that it decides in our favor . " meanwhile , schneider urged betting companies to re-write their legal conditions of business to help prosecutors press charges of fraud in cases of attempted match-fixing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing the whistle on corruption in sport the german branch of watchdog organization transparency international has called on sports-governing bodies to tackle corruption in the sports sector in the run up to this year 's world cup in germany .

but will unemployment decline quickly enough to offset the negative effects that next year 's vat hike will have on consumer spending ? the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said on tuesday that it expects the german economy will continue to expand in the coming two years .
in its latest world economic outlook , the oecd predicted that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2.6 percent in 2006 , 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008 . " the economy has entered a period of sustainable recovery is projected to grow above potential throughout the projection period , " according to the report . consumer polls support - at least in part - the optimistic forecasts .
a survey published on tuesday by the association for consumer research in nuremberg -lrb- gfk -rrb- revealed that germans are more willing to spend money on durable goods now than at any point since 2001 .
the rise in domestic consumer spending has been a key factor in lifting europe 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . that , in turn , has led a dramatic reduction of germany 's budget deficit .
the oecd predicts that berlin will only run a deficit of 2.3 percent of gdp for 2006 - the first time since 2002 that germany has managed to stay within the 3 percent upper limit on deficit spending laid down by eu stability and growth pact . but experts disagree as to whether the upswing represents a long-term trend or merely a temporary spike , as germans make major purchases before a tax hike comes into effect . vat 's up with the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's coffers are relatively full , but taxes could slow growth there 's general consensus that germans are spending more now because of the government 's plan to raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , or sales tax , from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 . " the rational decision to bring forward purchases to miss the impending vat increase in particular is likely to provide an additional boast in domestic demand at the end of the year , " a survey published by the association for consumer research in october already concluded . according to that survey , almost a third of germans were buying now so as to avoid paying 3 percent more next year . that would suggest that consumer spending will substantially diminish in 2007 , possibly putting a screeching halt to the economy 's overall performance .
the oecd , too , thinks that the rise in vat will cost germany around a quarter of a percentage point in gdp growth next year .
for that reason , the organization 's predictions for germany in 2007 are less positive than for 2006 or 2008 . the oecd believes that the dip could well be offset by a drop in unemployment , which would bolster domestic spending .
and the organization said that overall the risks to the economy were " well-balanced . " no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes german will still buy new cars despite the rise in vat but there are other less promising scenarios . " a stronger impact from the vat increase can not be excluded , " the oecd wrote .
" a significant appreciation of the euro could undermine recovery , as could a somewhat more protracted weakening of the us and the global economy . " the association for consumer research said that while germans feel good about spending money now , increasing numbers of them fear that their disposable income will decrease next year , perhaps leading them to become more frugal . 2007 may thus become a watershed year for the german economy - and , with it , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .
if the recovery continues , merkel 's cabinet can take credit for bringing deficit spending under control .
but if the economy returns to the doldrums , voters are likely blame those politicians who approved a potential risky tax hike . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd report on russia 's energy sector bad news for eu russia 's economic boom and the burgeoning power of its energy sector will become increasingly hard to sustain unless it takes dramatic steps , an oecd report forecasts .

but do n't get it confused with deodorant , nasal spray or oven cleaner . masculan , goliath , pullitt … the names may vary , but traditional condoms all had one thing in common .
someone had to fish them out of the package and put them on .
but if an idea by the german company vinico world of condoms pans out , that will be changing .
the firm is hoping to market a spray-on condom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aeresol cans are good for more than just graffiti these days jan vinzenz krause , who 's listed on the firm 's web site as the director of the project and a member of the " institute for condom consulting , " said contraception from a can offers a range of advantages .
there 's no need to worry about spray-on condoms being damaged by rough transport or excessive sunlight , they 're quick on the draw , and their size matches each individual user 's specific physiognomy . " no slippage , no pinching , just pure fun , " krause wrote . the condom consists of a mixture of natural rubber and water and is applied by using what looked like a normal aerosol can .
the rubber and water vulcanize at room temperature .
and the company claims that after usage the rubber then breaks down into humus , easing the sometimes awkward issue of post-coital disposal . career opportunities last year the chinese brought out what was claimed to be the world 's first aerosol condom , but it was for women , whereas vinico 's product is , um , aimed at men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun with aeresol courtesy of german entrepreneurs it 's currently undergoing tests to determine whether it 's safe , and in what sounds like an instance of adolescent male wish-fulfillment , the company is looking for people who are willing to try out the spray .
men whose anatomy falls at the extreme short or long end of the physical spectrum are particularly encouraged to apply . applications are anonymous .
kraus hopes the test results will be positive enough that spray-on condoms can hit the market in the summer of 2008 . for prospective guinea pigs who are unsure whether they fit the physical profile , the web site offers a size guide and a virtual tape measure . if this is not just a hoax , the world of bumps and studs , banana flavors and strawberry scents , may be just a few steps away from becoming one curiosity richer .

the appointment will cheer itv and its shareholders the appointment of the bbc 's chairman to run the uk 's biggest commercial television company , itv , is remarkable , not least for its timing .
itv has just rebuffed a takeover bid from richard branson and the cable company ntl , and seen almost 18 % of its shares bought by the satellite company bskyb , part of rupert murdoch 's empire .
michael grade is another larger-than-life media figure to step into the high-octane itv drama in recent weeks and he - unlike the others - has got his hands on the train set .
as executive chairman , he will be running itv and so the long-drawn-out search for a chief executive is off .
how he will respond to itv 's new biggest shareholder bskyb remains to be seen .
he will relish the challenge of trying to improve the network 's fortunes grade moves to itv meanwhile , the bbc is in the final stages of negotiations with the government over its next licence fee settlement .
under the new bbc charter , michael grade was due to take over as chairman of the bbc trust , which will replace the board of governors on 1 january .
instead he will be joining its biggest rival as executive chairman .
as a former chief executive of channel 4 , director of bbc television and programme director at london weekend , his appointment will cheer itv and its shareholders , who have seen audiences and advertising tumble .
his uncle was lew grade , one of the founding itv moguls , and he will relish the challenge of trying to improve the network 's fortunes .
but he leaves a big hole at the bbc , as it moves into a new charter and system of governance , over which he led the negotiations and was expected to provide continuity .
jeff randall , of the daily telegraph , who broke the story , said mr grade 's decision had come as a shock to the corporation .
on bbc news 24 , he said very senior bbc figures had told him : " there is carnage inside the bbc , mayhem , people are incandescent with rage at michael grade 's defection . "
if so , that is not what the bbc was saying publicly .
in a statement , it said : " clearly this is a surprise , especially at this moment .
for the last two-and-a-half years , michael grade has been a great chairman , who along with the director general mark thompson has achieved a successful charter settlement for the bbc .
we wish michael well . "
in some ways , bbc insiders say , this is not such a bad time for the chairman to leave .
the charter is secured for a further 10 years , with the bbc still to be funded by the licence fee .
whoever takes over as chairman of the trust will have a critical role to play in the future direction and regulation of the bbc the level of the licence fee settlement is in the final stages of negotiation , and will be announced shortly .
mr grade ensured that the new members of the bbc trust have a great deal of experience in the media world , so there is a strong base to build on .
and , of course , it 's the bbc director general mark thompson who actually runs the bbc day-to-day , not the chairman , who under the new system of governance has a more hands-off role .
even so , whoever takes over as chairman of the trust will have a critical role to play in the future direction and regulation of the bbc .
drama sudden departures are not new at the top of the bbc .
mr grade was appointed two-and-a-half years ago as a steadying hand , after the previous chairman gavyn davies resigned - and the director general greg dyke was sacked .
that followed heavy criticism in the hutton report , prompted by the death of dr david kelly and the bbc coverage of the government 's dossier claiming iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
the chairman before that , sir christopher bland , suddenly announced he was leaving to be chairman of bt .
michael grade 's last move from the bbc was equally sudden .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- michael grade : why i left the bbc bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 28 november 2006 , 08:37 gmt michael grade : why i left the bbc the news that bbc chairman michael grade would leave the bbc to run commercial rival itv came as a huge surprise .
in a letter to staff , mr grade outlined the reasons for his departure .
dear friends and colleagues , a short while ago , an announcement was made to the stock exchange about my appointment to itv .
it contains some bare facts which disguise what has been a huge personal decision for me , namely to leave the bbc .
firstly , i would like everyone to understand this is a career decision .
what it is not is a reaction to anything , internal or external .
i was faced with the choice of getting back into programming or ' governing ' the bbc from a distance .
those of you who know me will understand just what an effort of will it has taken for me , as chairman of the governors , not to look at the overnight ratings every day , not to engage in idle programming chit chat with the brilliant creatives who are currently taking bbc television , radio and on line to new heights of quality - and so on .
looking back over the past two and a half years , i can say i have never felt so privileged , never felt such a responsibility , and never felt so proud .
being the chairman of the bbc was the most unexpected job i have ever had .
the welcome you gave me on my arrival is embedded deep within my emotional dna .
at that moment i realised what was at stake for me , for the bbc .
so much has been accomplished in the last two and a half years that i feel comfortable that i have achieved what i set out to achieve - namely restore the equilibrium of the this great institution , to lead the process to appoint a new dg -lsb- director general -rsb- , to secure a new ten year charter and to reform the governance of the corporation .
with the help of my fellow governors and the new governance unit , the future is secure , the independence of the bbc is safeguarded and , most important of all , our programmes across all media are maintaining the overwhelming support of the licence fee payers .
itv is a competitor to the bbc , yes .
but the bbc does need itv to be strong , both for competitive reasons and to maintain the balance of power within british public service broadcasting .
so i leave with the feeling that i have done the best i can to secure the future of the institution about which i will always care so deeply , i leave with some sadness because of all the friends old and new who have been my support over the past two and a half years .
what i wo n't miss is the bbc sandwiches at meetings .
they have taken re-cycling to new heights .
but i digress ...
in a speech i made when i was ceo at channel 4 i included the words : " it 's the bbc that keeps the rest of the industry honest . "
that is as true today as it ever was .
i am off to a new challenge , maybe at 63 my last real job , and hopefully give you a run for your money .
that 's how it should be .
look after auntie , i am sure you wo n't need me again .
and thank you for having me .

so i leave with the feeling that i have done the best i can to secure the future of the institution about which i will always care so deeply , i leave with some sadness because of all the friends old and new who have been my support over the past two and a half years .
what i wo n't miss is the bbc sandwiches at meetings .
they have taken re-cycling to new heights .
but i digress ...
in a speech i made when i was ceo at channel 4 i included the words : " it 's the bbc that keeps the rest of the industry honest . "
that is as true today as it ever was .
i am off to a new challenge , maybe at 63 my last real job , and hopefully give you a run for your money .
that 's how it should be .
look after auntie , i am sure you wo n't need me again .

in a letter to staff , mr grade outlined the reasons for his departure .
dear friends and colleagues , a short while ago , an announcement was made to the stock exchange about my appointment to itv .
it contains some bare facts which disguise what has been a huge personal decision for me , namely to leave the bbc .
firstly , i would like everyone to understand this is a career decision .
what it is not is a reaction to anything , internal or external .
i was faced with the choice of getting back into programming or ' governing ' the bbc from a distance .
those of you who know me will understand just what an effort of will it has taken for me , as chairman of the governors , not to look at the overnight ratings every day , not to engage in idle programming chit chat with the brilliant creatives who are currently taking bbc television , radio and on line to new heights of quality - and so on .
looking back over the past two and a half years , i can say i have never felt so privileged , never felt such a responsibility , and never felt so proud .
being the chairman of the bbc was the most unexpected job i have ever had .
the welcome you gave me on my arrival is embedded deep within my emotional dna .
at that moment i realised what was at stake for me , for the bbc .
so much has been accomplished in the last two and a half years that i feel comfortable that i have achieved what i set out to achieve - namely restore the equilibrium of the this great institution , to lead the process to appoint a new dg -lsb- director general -rsb- , to secure a new ten year charter and to reform the governance of the corporation .
with the help of my fellow governors and the new governance unit , the future is secure , the independence of the bbc is safeguarded and , most important of all , our programmes across all media are maintaining the overwhelming support of the licence fee payers .

more than 200,000 people were killed when an earthquake beneath the indian ocean sent massive waves crashing ashore on 26 december 2004 .
filmed on location in thailand , one of the countries worst affected by the disaster , tsunami , the aftermath follows a group of fictional characters whose lives are forever changed by the devastation wreaked on the holiday resorts of phuket and khao lak .
based on extensive research and interviews , the two-part film is written by abi morgan - best known for her award-winning dramas murder and sex traffic .
" obviously i did n't want to intrude on anyone 's grief or plagiarise anyone 's story , " she says .
" but we needed to do it as soon as possible to keep the memory alive . "
' deeply personal ' director bharat nalluri , whose previous successes include life on mars and spooks , admits the very word ' tsunami ' evokes images of destruction and chaos akin to a hollywood disaster movie .
" as soon as i started reading abi 's script , though , i realised it was n't that at all , " he says .
" it was something far more profound and affecting - a subtle and deeply personal piece about how people respond to tragedy .
" the great power of drama is it allows us to follow very complex stories . "
of the many stories that interweave over the course of the three-hour programme , one that stands out is that of a young couple struggling to cope with the loss of their six-year-old daughter .
actor chiwetel ejiofor , who plays the girl 's distraught father , said he had some reservations about accepting the role .
" it 's hard not to feel invasive somehow , " he says .
" but i think it was important to tell the story as quickly as possible .
" when i read the script , i realised there was so much i did n't know about the tsunami and what happened afterwards . "
' absolute integrity ' in a cast that includes oscar nominees tim roth , toni collette and sophie okonedo , britain 's gina mckee stands out as a widowed mother trying to arrange a flight home for her wounded son .
the sunderland-born actress admits to having similar concerns to ejiofor , but says morgan did " a terrific job " .
" i 'm not sure how you time something like this , " she tells the bbc news website .
" how do you know when the time is right ?
" but the film deals with the event in a mature and responsible way , and i knew that it was being done with absolute integrity . "
in addition to the personal stories of those caught up in the catastrophe , tsunami also looks at wider issues concerning the international response to the incident and the need to implement and improve early warning systems .
it also suggests that some hotel chains exploited the tragedy by building on land where fishing villages once stood .
" when you go to thailand you see how it affected the people and how it 's still not back to normal , " explains actress kate ashfield , who plays a hotel chain representative in the bbc-hbo co-production .
" i hope the drama highlights what a beautiful country it is and demonstrates that we bear a global responsibility for these disasters , " adds abi morgan .
tsunami , the aftermath begins on bbc two at 2100 gmt on 28 november .

tim roth -lrb- l -rrb- plays a hard-nosed journalist reporting on the disaster more than 200,000 people were killed when an earthquake beneath the indian ocean sent massive waves crashing ashore on 26 december 2004 .
filmed on location in thailand , one of the countries worst affected by the disaster , tsunami , the aftermath follows a group of fictional characters whose lives are forever changed by the devastation wreaked on the holiday resorts of phuket and khao lak .
based on extensive research and interviews , the two-part film is written by abi morgan - best known for her award-winning dramas murder and sex traffic .
" obviously i did n't want to intrude on anyone 's grief or plagiarise anyone 's story , " she says .
" but we needed to do it as soon as possible to keep the memory alive . "
' deeply personal ' director bharat nalluri , whose previous successes include life on mars and spooks , admits the very word ' tsunami ' evokes images of destruction and chaos akin to a hollywood disaster movie .
" as soon as i started reading abi 's script , though , i realised it was n't that at all , " he says .
okonedo and ejiofor play parents looking for a missing child " it was something far more profound and affecting - a subtle and deeply personal piece about how people respond to tragedy .
" the great power of drama is it allows us to follow very complex stories . "
of the many stories that interweave over the course of the three-hour programme , one that stands out is that of a young couple struggling to cope with the loss of their six-year-old daughter .
actor chiwetel ejiofor , who plays the girl 's distraught father , said he had some reservations about accepting the role .
" it 's hard not to feel invasive somehow , " he says .
" but i think it was important to tell the story as quickly as possible .
" when i read the script , i realised there was so much i did n't know about the tsunami and what happened afterwards . "
' absolute integrity ' in a cast that includes oscar nominees tim roth , toni collette and sophie okonedo , britain 's gina mckee stands out as a widowed mother trying to arrange a flight home for her wounded son .
the sunderland-born actress admits to having similar concerns to ejiofor , but says morgan did " a terrific job " .
the cast also includes toni collette and thai actor samrit machielsen " i 'm not sure how you time something like this , " she tells the bbc news website .
" how do you know when the time is right ?
" but the film deals with the event in a mature and responsible way , and i knew that it was being done with absolute integrity . "
in addition to the personal stories of those caught up in the catastrophe , tsunami also looks at wider issues concerning the international response to the incident and the need to implement and improve early warning systems .
it also suggests that some hotel chains exploited the tragedy by building on land where fishing villages once stood .
" when you go to thailand you see how it affected the people and how it 's still not back to normal , " explains actress kate ashfield , who plays a hotel chain representative in the bbc-hbo co-production .
" i hope the drama highlights what a beautiful country it is and demonstrates that we bear a global responsibility for these disasters , " adds abi morgan .

it is all part of a search for new technology that could help ground troops detect threats in urban areas .
surveillance cameras in rubber balls , guns that can fire around corners , robotic heavy machine guns and unmanned warplanes .
it all sounds a little bit like the heath-robinson contraptions on robot wars or doctor who , but the ministry of defence has already evaluated all of these items for use in urban warfare .
now it is setting up a challenge to see if british inventors can go even further in their blue skies thinking and revolutionise the way war is fought in cities .
army planners and politicians on both sides of the atlantic have a dream .
if more and more reconnaissance , and even fighting missions , can be undertaken by robots and drones , then military and civilian casualties can be reduced .
during the afghanistan and iraq wars , the use of unmanned aerial vehicles -lrb- uavs -rrb- such as the now well-known general atomics predator drone has risen dramatically with an estimated 800 operating in the two countries .
the us is leading the way in the new technology , but the mod hopes it can unearth another rj mitchell , the famed inventor of the spitfire , and encourage small businesses , university labs and even " shed inventors " to pitch in .
candidates making the shortlist will get funding and help to develop a prototype machine and look forward to production .
piloted from control centres as far afield as nevada , the drones scan insurgent positions , detect roadside bombs and now can be equipped with air-to-surface missiles .
newspapers reported in august that the uk was buying at least two of the latest predators for use in afghanistan .
their ability to watch over cities for 30 hours without a break sets them apart from manned surveillance planes .
almost as renowned in military circles is foster-miller 's talon robot , used to peer inside caves in tora bora in the hunt for osama bin laden .
examples of use of drones in dangerous areas such as falluja have convinced officials that urban warfare will be increasingly influenced by new technology and it will not just be flying robots .
predator b speed : 250 mph wingspan : 66ft weight : 4536 kg missiles : four hellfire endurance : 30 hours + jane 's aerospace and technology editor bill sweetman said consumer and military technology was increasingly feeding off each other , something the mod will be looking to exploit .
miniaturisation of digital camera technology is making possible mini-drones that could go right up to insurgents ' positions in a way that humans could only replicate with great risk .
" it means that every reconnaissance operation does n't have the potential to blow up into a firefight , " mr sweetman explained .
the mod is asking for competitors to " produce a system that can detect , identify , monitor and report a comprehensive range of threats in a complex urban environment " .
but as well as robotics it is looking for developments in sensors like thermal imaging that could help in crowded cities .
it has recently carried through the urbex project to evaluate available equipment for use in urban warfare .
great military boffins hiram maxim : machine gun rj mitchell : spitfire frank whittle : jet engine robert watson-watt : radar barnes wallis : bouncing bomb devices included the " eye ball " , sensors packed into a ball that can be hurled into a building by soldiers , and the " cornershot " a gun with a camera that can fire round corners while the soldier remains safe behind cover .

great military boffins hiram maxim : machine gun rj mitchell : spitfire frank whittle : jet engine robert watson-watt : radar barnes wallis : bouncing bomb devices included the " eye ball " , sensors packed into a ball that can be hurled into a building by soldiers , and the " cornershot " a gun with a camera that can fire round corners while the soldier remains safe behind cover .
also attracting interest were robots that could blow access holes in buildings , as well as a machine that uses acoustic sensors to locate where sniper fire is coming from and automatically returns fire with a machine gun .
now the mod is going a step further and trying to encourage some more competition for the established arms manufacturers like bae , thales , and lockheed martin .
it will be trying to avoid the example of sir frank whittle , where early scepticism delayed the military introduction of his ideas on jet engines .
and it emphasises the competition is open to absolutely anyone .
anyone who can keep a secret that is .

the one laptop per child laptops , conceived and produced by a philanthropic group of designers and engineers led by nicholas negroponte - co-founder of the media lab at massachusetts institute of technology - would begin arriving " within the next week , " the project 's chief technical officer , mary lou jepsen , explained .
she told bbc world service 's digital planet programme that the design of the $ 100 laptop was highly innovative , centring on a cpu , or processor , that saves power by knowing when to turn itself off .
" the reason the cpu is usually on on a laptop is simply to refresh the screen , so in the timing controller chip for the display we put some memory - so when nothing 's changing on the screen , it goes into self-refresh mode to save power , " she explained .
" half the kids in the world have little or no access to power , so it 's been much harder to make a two-watt laptop .
" it 's two watts because a kid can then use a crank or a foot pedal to recharge the batteries on their laptop - for six minutes ' -lsb- work -rsb- , they get an hour of charge .
that seemed like the ideal ratio to us . "
flash exploit the idea for the laptops was first reported early last year , ahead of the scheme 's official launch at the world summit on the information society .
the plan is to bring affordable computing to school children in the developing world , chiming with the united nation 's aims of bridging the " digital divide " within the next decade .
a total of 1,000 laptops have been produced so far , with plans to ramp up production from thousands to millions within a few months .
ms jepsen said one of the keys to developing the laptops had been the " ipod revolution " which had shown how flash memory could be exploited .
the $ 100 laptop uses flash memory rather than a hard drive - which ms jepsen described as " expensive , power-hungry and the leading cause of hardware failure in laptops " .
" we had to find a way to get rid of them , " she added .
the other important factor in getting the price down , she said , was the screen - which in a normal laptop alone costs over $ 100 .
" radical new performance " had been achieved through a " re-think of the fundamental design of the screen , " meaning that the cost of the screen for the $ 100 laptops is a third of the usual price .
it also takes a maximum of 14 % of the power consumption , as well as being readable in sunlight , and has a high-resolution .
" that 's important because the justification for the expenditure by the ministry of education is book replacement , " said ms jepsen .
however , there have been claims that once distribution and repair costs are taken into account the true cost of the laptops is nearer $ 1,000 than $ 100 .
ms jepsen admitted that these costs do exist , but said they were " literally pennies per month " .
" there is , in kind , contribution from the governments that do the distribution of the laptops , but other than that we 're dropping 100,000 units a month to each country , " she added , " and that is not very expensive - it really is cents per laptop to ship . "

campaigners want to replace st george with what they describe as a " home-grown hero king " .
st george became patron saint in 1061 but the position was originally held by st edmund who gave his name to bury st edmunds in suffolk where he is buried .
a two-carriage train operating in the east by one railway is to be named st edmund at a ceremony in ipswich .

the company has worked with the east of england tourist board to try to encourage people to visit the region .
mr meades said : " this has got people thinking what st edmund means , where can i visit his heritage .
" hopefully , we can attract people to come to the region and travel on the st edmund . "
viking raiders the campaign has also received the backing of the mp for bury st edmunds , david ruffley , and local historians .
historian clive paine said : " there are no added bits to the story , there is no dragon , there are no maidens , which were all added to st george 's story much later on to make him part of chivalry .
" with edmund , like the rest of us anglo saxons , what you see is what you get . "

embed this video on your site watch in the news player the first $ 100 laptop prototypes are to reach children in the developing world in the next few days , the consortium developing them has said .
the one laptop per child laptops , conceived and produced by a philanthropic group of designers and engineers led by nicholas negroponte - co-founder of the media lab at massachusetts institute of technology - would begin arriving " within the next week , " the project 's chief technical officer , mary lou jepsen , explained .
she told bbc world service 's digital planet programme that the design of the $ 100 laptop was highly innovative , centring on a cpu , or processor , that saves power by knowing when to turn itself off .
" the reason the cpu is usually on on a laptop is simply to refresh the screen , so in the timing controller chip for the display we put some memory - so when nothing 's changing on the screen , it goes into self-refresh mode to save power , " she explained .
" half the kids in the world have little or no access to power , so it 's been much harder to make a two-watt laptop .
it is hoped the laptop will bridge the digital divide " it 's two watts because a kid can then use a crank or a foot pedal to recharge the batteries on their laptop - for six minutes ' -lsb- work -rsb- , they get an hour of charge .
that seemed like the ideal ratio to us . "
flash exploit the idea for the laptops was first reported early last year , ahead of the scheme 's official launch at the world summit on the information society .
the plan is to bring affordable computing to school children in the developing world , chiming with the united nation 's aims of bridging the " digital divide " within the next decade .
a total of 1,000 laptops have been produced so far , with plans to ramp up production from thousands to millions within a few months .
ms jepsen said one of the keys to developing the laptops had been the " ipod revolution " which had shown how flash memory could be exploited .
the $ 100 laptop uses flash memory rather than a hard drive - which ms jepsen described as " expensive , power-hungry and the leading cause of hardware failure in laptops " .
" we had to find a way to get rid of them , " she added .
the other important factor in getting the price down , she said , was the screen - which in a normal laptop alone costs over $ 100 .
" radical new performance " had been achieved through a " re-think of the fundamental design of the screen , " meaning that the cost of the screen for the $ 100 laptops is a third of the usual price .
nicholas negroponte led the development of the idea it also takes a maximum of 14 % of the power consumption , as well as being readable in sunlight , and has a high-resolution .
" that 's important because the justification for the expenditure by the ministry of education is book replacement , " said ms jepsen .
however , there have been claims that once distribution and repair costs are taken into account the true cost of the laptops is nearer $ 1,000 than $ 100 .
ms jepsen admitted that these costs do exist , but said they were " literally pennies per month " .
" there is , in kind , contribution from the governments that do the distribution of the laptops , but other than that we 're dropping 100,000 units a month to each country , " she added , " and that is not very expensive - it really is cents per laptop to ship . "

embed this video on your site watch in the news player the first $ 100 laptop prototypes are to reach children in the developing world in the next few days , the consortium developing them has said .
the one laptop per child laptops , conceived and produced by a philanthropic group of designers and engineers led by nicholas negroponte - co-founder of the media lab at massachusetts institute of technology - would begin arriving " within the next week , " the project 's chief technical officer , mary lou jepsen , explained .
she told bbc world service 's digital planet programme that the design of the $ 100 laptop was highly innovative , centring on a cpu , or processor , that saves power by knowing when to turn itself off .
" the reason the cpu is usually on on a laptop is simply to refresh the screen , so in the timing controller chip for the display we put some memory - so when nothing 's changing on the screen , it goes into self-refresh mode to save power , " she explained .
" half the kids in the world have little or no access to power , so it 's been much harder to make a two-watt laptop .
it is hoped the laptop will bridge the digital divide " it 's two watts because a kid can then use a crank or a foot pedal to recharge the batteries on their laptop - for six minutes ' -lsb- work -rsb- , they get an hour of charge .
that seemed like the ideal ratio to us . "
flash exploit the idea for the laptops was first reported early last year , ahead of the scheme 's official launch at the world summit on the information society .
the plan is to bring affordable computing to school children in the developing world , chiming with the united nation 's aims of bridging the " digital divide " within the next decade .
a total of 1,000 laptops have been produced so far , with plans to ramp up production from thousands to millions within a few months .
ms jepsen said one of the keys to developing the laptops had been the " ipod revolution " which had shown how flash memory could be exploited .
the $ 100 laptop uses flash memory rather than a hard drive - which ms jepsen described as " expensive , power-hungry and the leading cause of hardware failure in laptops " .
" we had to find a way to get rid of them , " she added .
the other important factor in getting the price down , she said , was the screen - which in a normal laptop alone costs over $ 100 .
" radical new performance " had been achieved through a " re-think of the fundamental design of the screen , " meaning that the cost of the screen for the $ 100 laptops is a third of the usual price .
nicholas negroponte led the development of the idea it also takes a maximum of 14 % of the power consumption , as well as being readable in sunlight , and has a high-resolution .
" that 's important because the justification for the expenditure by the ministry of education is book replacement , " said ms jepsen .
however , there have been claims that once distribution and repair costs are taken into account the true cost of the laptops is nearer $ 1,000 than $ 100 .
ms jepsen admitted that these costs do exist , but said they were " literally pennies per month " .
" there is , in kind , contribution from the governments that do the distribution of the laptops , but other than that we 're dropping 100,000 units a month to each country , " she added , " and that is not very expensive - it really is cents per laptop to ship . "

the downing street image shows mr blair standing on a staircase slightly above his wife with his arm around her .
the banister is festooned with garlands while images of past leaders decorate the wall behind them .
he had chosen the " very simple " image with cherie , but said : " it does n't sound half as interesting as gordon 's one was . "
the chancellor 's card featured an image by well known children 's illustrator axel scheffler of a christmas tree with children reading books around it - and one child in a corner looking perplexed at a red dispatch box .
mr brown 's christmas card included the red dispatch box in mr blair 's card , the message inside says : " with best wishes for christmas and the new year . "
asked about his role in choosing the image at the cbi business conference , mr blair said : " i 'm sure this sounds like a real politician 's answer , but it 's the only way the prime minister does it : my wife and i chose it together .
" i mean , how pathetic , is that ? "
in previous years , the prime minister 's family of four children have been included .
some newspapers have interpreted of the setting for the blairs ' card - with the portraits of previous no 10 residents - as recognition of mr blair 's forthcoming departure from the pm 's job .
conservative leader david cameron and liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell 's cards have yet to released .

the downing street image shows mr blair standing on a staircase slightly above his wife with his arm around her .
the banister is festooned with garlands while images of past leaders decorate the wall behind them .
he had chosen the " very simple " image with cherie , but said : " it does n't sound half as interesting as gordon 's one was . "
the chancellor 's card featured an image by well known children 's illustrator axel scheffler of a christmas tree with children reading books around it - and one child in a corner looking perplexed at a red dispatch box .
mr brown 's christmas card included the red dispatch box in mr blair 's card , the message inside says : " with best wishes for christmas and the new year . "
asked about his role in choosing the image at the cbi business conference , mr blair said : " i 'm sure this sounds like a real politician 's answer , but it 's the only way the prime minister does it : my wife and i chose it together .
" i mean , how pathetic , is that ? "
in previous years , the prime minister 's family of four children have been included .
some newspapers have interpreted of the setting for the blairs ' card - with the portraits of previous no 10 residents - as recognition of mr blair 's forthcoming departure from the pm 's job .
conservative leader david cameron and liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell 's cards have yet to released .

bualoi posit , 23 , and wichai somkhaoyai , 24 , have been told they will not be executed for raping and killing 21-year-old katherine horton .
the reading university student was with a friend when she was attacked on new year 's day on koh samui 's lamai beach .
her mother elizabeth said she wanted " life to mean life " in this case .
miss horton was attacked as she made a mobile phone call on the beach where she and a friend had rented accommodation .
the two fishermen , who had been drinking and watching pornography , beat her with the parasol pole of a beach umbrella , raped her and then dumped her out at sea , where she drowned .
the pair were arrested within days of the murder and both admitted rape and murder charges .
they were sentenced to death by lethal injection but immediately appealed against their sentences .
a foreign office spokesman confirmed the two men will no longer face the death penalty and that the appeal verdict will be read out at surat thani court in southern thailand on thursday .
ian horton said the family were " uniform " over letting the thai judicial procedure run its course .
he said : " we are not involved in that and we have never been involved in that .
' spirit ' " if the judicial procedure results in a commutation of the death sentence , so be it .
" if it results in the carrying out of the death sentence , then so be it . "
katherine 's mother , elizabeth , told bbc wales she did not agree with the death penalty but she wanted " life to mean life " in this case .
katherine horton 's friend , fay jones , told radio wales that ms horton herself would not have wanted the death sentence imposed .
she said : " i do n't think that katherine would have wanted them to get the death penalty .
i know that katherine 's mum made that quite clear in january and i support that fully .
she added : " i think they deserve to spend their last days in prison . "
ms jones described her late friend as the " most wonderful girl with a great spirit for life " .
" to lose a friend is horrific .
to lose someone like katherine is ten times worse than that .
" for my own part it 's been very difficult coping with the fact that she 's no longer here , particularly as we get into the run-up to christmas , when i would have caught up with katherine , and obviously the new year marks the anniversary , " she added .
" it 's been difficult for everybody and obviously for katherine 's family .
they 've been through so much this year and i just hope we can put an end to this now . "

" alan was a lovely , lovely bloke , " said andy kershaw .
" there was no ego to him , even though he was a national icon . "
speaking on radio 4 's today programme , dj paul gambaccini said the ex-radio 1 star had " utilised the possibilities of sound in broadcasting " .
" whispering " bob harris , meanwhile , saluted his ability to " go across genres and different musical tastes " .
" towards the end of his career on radio 2 , he was doing a weekly classical music programme much in the style of the way he presented pick of the pops .
at all times i found him inspirational and a true professional noel edmonds " so even there he was bringing a kind of revolutionary new approach to classical music broadcasting . "
" at the start of my career with radio luxembourg alan was a major inspiration and a great support , " said noel edmonds .
" when i joined radio one , the relationship became even stronger and i could always rely on him for advice and encouragement .
at all times i found him inspirational and a true professional . "
according to gambaccini , freeman " had a much wider range of dynamics and pitch in his own voice and a use of musical clips and soundbites , as they would now be called , to give you a fuller palette " .
" this was a major contribution to the medium , " he continued .
speaking to bbc radio coventry and warwickshire , radio 3 's kershaw highlighted his friendly demeanour .
freeman " effectively invented the chart rundown " , said bannister " you 'd bump into him in the corridor and he 'd say , ' hello lovely boy - how are you ? '
" he just always took the time to make sure you were alright . "
former radio 1 controller matthew bannister , meanwhile , described freeman as " a true radio pioneer " .
" it seems odd to think of it now , but he was the man who effectively invented the chart rundown , " he told the bbc .
" the chart rundown , which is such a staple of radio , did not exist in the 1950s when alan freeman arrived from australia . "
with his familiar welcome of " greetings , pop pickers " and " not ' arf " catchphrase , freeman was an institution in british radio who spent more than 40 years in broadcasting .
