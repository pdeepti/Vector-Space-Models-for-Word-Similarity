the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?
maybe we need to change our priorities , define things anew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2006 opinion : learning to think outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family with two kids is becoming a rarity in germany once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?
maybe we need to change our priorities , define things anew .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve .

israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 germans debate best energy mix for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will renewable or nuclear energy feed germany 's power grid ?
rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .

but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .

" this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?
maybe we need to change our priorities , define things anew .

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 germans debate best energy mix for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will renewable or nuclear energy feed germany 's power grid ?
rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .

israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible .

israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come .

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 germans debate best energy mix for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will renewable or nuclear energy feed germany 's power grid ?
rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .
" if i return to afghanistan with no electricity , computer or teacher , what exactly do you expect me to learn ? " dw staff -lrb- rp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report on afghanistan shows continuing threats to progress afghanistan 's efforts to establish democracy are threatened by widespread corruption , the cultivation of opium and insecurity , including the presence of illegal armies . -lrb- dec .
11 , 2005 -rrb- are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ?
fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .
" if i return to afghanistan with no electricity , computer or teacher , what exactly do you expect me to learn ?

fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees .

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .

that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 germans debate best energy mix for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will renewable or nuclear energy feed germany 's power grid ?
rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended .

" i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.01.2006 israel threatens iran over nuclear research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has struck iraq 's nuclear program in the past israel was taking advantage sunday of the growing international pressure on arch enemy iran to dangle the threat of pre-emptive action to stop iran 's nuclear program in its tracks . army chief of staff dan halutz became the latest senior defense official to fire a warning shot across tehran 's bows by telling a security conference that israel would not be " helpless " in the face of tehran if it acquired nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli defense minister shaul mofaz his comments followed a pledge by defense minister shaul mofaz that israel , widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the middle east , would not tolerate a " a nuclear option " for iran while reaffirming his commitment to diplomacy over the escalating crisis . israel has come to view the regime in tehran as its number one enemy , with its fears reinforced by comments from iranian president mahmoud ahamadinejad that the jewish state should be " wiped off the face of the map . " questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 germans debate best energy mix for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will renewable or nuclear energy feed germany 's power grid ?
rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

frescoes depicting instruments and angels plucking at strings are dotted around the village center .
the recently renovated geigenbaumuseum traces the important role of music in this area .

the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2006 opinion : learning to think outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family with two kids is becoming a rarity in germany once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?
maybe we need to change our priorities , define things anew .
narrow-minded thinking and taboos do n't help in any case . uta thofern -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition partners tussle for custody of germany 's families walking a fine line between cooperating in a government coalition and campaigning in state elections , germany 's christian and social democrats are trying to score points by promoting better childcare opportunities .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended .

" i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

" questioned about how the defense establishment was preparing itself with the challenge posed by iran , halutz refused to give details but nevertheless made clear that he had plans up his sleeve . " i am not going to deal with the solutions to the iranian nuclear problem , " he said .
" israel is not helpless - that it is enough of an answer . " embolde n ed by security cou n cil possibility ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel attack iran 's nuclear plants such as this one in natanz ?
israel managed to halt iraq 's nuclear program in 1981 when it carried out an air strike on the osirak plant . while officials have said diplomacy is still the order of the day on iran , the outgoing head of military intelligence , aharon zeevi , said last month that a repeat performance was " difficult but not impossible . " israel appears to have been emboldened by the concerted drive by western powers to bring iran before the un security council , with the prospect of sanctions . iran says its nuclear program is legal as it is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and merely designed to meet its energy needs .
israel however is convinced tehran is on a drive to equip itself with nuclear weapons . calling it a " childish game , " iran downplayed the israeli threat on sunday , saying that the country would make a " fatal mistake " if it were to use force against iran . iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said israel was only trying to add to western pressure on iran to give up its nuclear program , according to ap news service . iranian officials also denied a german news report that tehran had sent an offer to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to accept a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china outside iran as a way to diffuse the stand-off . ira n blasts ' shameful ' chirac nuclear war n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac french president jacques chirac came under attack in iran sunday after warning that france could use nuclear arms against state sponsors of terrorism . " it is shameful for the people of france that their president brandishes atomic weapons on the pretext of fighting terrorism , " said gholam ali hadad-adel , speaker of iran 's parliament . on thursday , chirac for the first time raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches " terrorist " attacks against france . although he did not single out any country , the warning could be interpreted as including iran - frequently accused of sponsoring terrorism and under pressure over its disputed nuclear program . germa n defe n se mi n ister critiques chirac german defense minister franz josef jung meanwhile also criticized chirac 's remarks and called for a diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis with iran in an interview published sunday . jung told the bild am so n n tag newspaper that he found chirac 's comments counterproductive in the context of the west 's row with tehran over its controversial nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung during a visit to afghanistan in december " we should not lead the discussion in that direction , " he said .
" we need all options at our disposal .
but before that , everything must be attempted on the diplomatic front to achieve a positive outcome .
i am confident that we can find a diplomatic solution in the case of iran . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also warned against a " militarization of thoughts . " we should ensure that diplomatic solutions that remain on the table will be used and exhausted , " steinmeier said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
he added that germany was working to prevent military action against iran . a german government spokesman gave a cautious response friday to chirac 's remarks , which modified france 's long-standing nuclear doctrine to specifically warn that its atomic arsenal could be used against states that sponsor terror attacks on france . spokesman thomas steg told reporters that germany believed the french leader 's comments were in line with paris 's existing nuclear policy and did not see in chirac 's warning " any reason to believe that france 's policy has changed or will change in the future .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .
" if i return to afghanistan with no electricity , computer or teacher , what exactly do you expect me to learn ?

many top german companies have invested heavily in the state especially in the automobile , machinery and chemical sectors . with over 1,700 members , the german-iranian chamber of commerce and industry in iran is , according to its web site , the fifth largest such german representation in the world .
users logging on to its site now , however , will find it difficult - if not impossible - to see the names of those members . the chamber 's director , michael tockuss , said germany is iran 's number one partner in the construction business . " we have orders worth billions for german companies , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" construction firms like lurgi , krupp-uhde and dsd are working here on huge projects . " tockuss added that daimlerchrysler is set to begin production of its e-class mercedes-benz cars locally and volkswagen is already well established . us disapproves of germa n -ira n ia n busi n ess ties germany 's business concerns in the islamic republic have long been a source of disagreement between berlin and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade restrictions on iran could prove costly for german business in light of recent developments other countries are also debating how to , on the one hand send a clear message to tehran against the resumption nuclear research , while on the other hand protect their own interests .
emerging power china , for example , has turned to iranian oil to fuel its growing economy .
russia , too , would presumably not take any action that could endanger its business ties . although iranian oil accounts for less than half a percent of germany 's oil imports , international trade restrictions could prove very costly to german business .
despite the threat of sanctions it seems german firms will maintain their presence in iran , albeit with no little degree of secrecy . dw staff -lrb- rp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 call for iaea action over iran nuclear program europe 's leading nations pressed monday for an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog in two weeks over iran 's nuclear program , bringing the prospect of referral to the un security council a step closer .

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .
just days ago a suicide bombing in the southern city of spinboldak killed 26 people .
security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .
" if i return to afghanistan with no electricity , computer or teacher , what exactly do you expect me to learn ?

one young afghan talks to deutsche welle about his fears should he be forced to return home . if you are male , aged 18 to 60 and came to germany from afghanistan less than six years ago , you are probably eligible for immediate deportation . zobeir wardak meets these criteria .
the 20-year-old has been calling hamburg his home since 2001 .
his parents have disappeared and he can only guess whether they are still in afghanistan or have crossed the border into pakistan as refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg , home to 14,000 afghans anxious to fulfill his dream of becoming an information technology assistant , zobeir has continued his schooling .
his future is not in his own hands however .
as his asylum application has been turned down , he faces deportation . " i got a notice from the foreign office authorities - they told me that i had to leave in one or two weeks , " he said .
" i showed them my exam dates and they said they did n't care .
they simply stated ' you must return to afghanistan . " ' afgha n s face u n certai n future whe n repatriated in may of last year , the interior ministry of hamburg agreed to start deporting certain afghans .
since putting the plan into action thirty afghans have been forcibly deported from this northern german city that has the largest afghan community in the country .
the same number returned to afghanistan voluntarily and a further 30 went into hiding . during a visit to afghanistan , hamburg 's interior minister udo nagel determined that returnees would not be in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror attacks are common in present day afghanistan " terrorism in afghanistan is directed against the government or against non-afghans , " he told deutsche welle , adding that afghans are not the target of attacks . news reports paint a different picture .

security in afghanistan is bordering on nonexistent .
torture , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks are daily occurrences . amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has warned against the forced repatriation of afghans .
karola shaaf of ai and spokeswoman for the afghan coordination group in hamburg said the deportations are unjustified , especially in winter due to the lack of accommodation . hamburg leadi n g the way i n deportatio n s the city state 's interior minister , however , is unwilling to compromise .
other federal states are adopting similar strategies , trapping asylum seekers in a vicious circle : as their asylum status is not recognized , they are denied work permits .
with no option but unemployment they rely on state aid in the form of social welfare .
this in turn is used as a justification for deportation . zobeir is originally from wardak , a province south of kabul with no isaf troops and not much hope of a lull in violence in the near future .
he said he still hopes to continue his training in germany . " i am at school to become an it assistant , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.01.2006 german firms lower profile in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is one of many german firms with projects in iran as the international community considers a response to iran ’ s resumption of its nuclear program , germany may need to balance diplomacy with economic reality . for several years , germany has been exporting more products to iran than any other country in the middle east .
many top german companies have invested heavily in the state especially in the automobile , machinery and chemical sectors . with over 1,700 members , the german-iranian chamber of commerce and industry in iran is , according to its web site , the fifth largest such german representation in the world .
users logging on to its site now , however , will find it difficult - if not impossible - to see the names of those members . the chamber 's director , michael tockuss , said germany is iran 's number one partner in the construction business . " we have orders worth billions for german companies , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" construction firms like lurgi , krupp-uhde and dsd are working here on huge projects . " tockuss added that daimlerchrysler is set to begin production of its e-class mercedes-benz cars locally and volkswagen is already well established . us disapproves of germa n -ira n ia n busi n ess ties germany 's business concerns in the islamic republic have long been a source of disagreement between berlin and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade restrictions on iran could prove costly for german business in light of recent developments other countries are also debating how to , on the one hand send a clear message to tehran against the resumption nuclear research , while on the other hand protect their own interests .

many top german companies have invested heavily in the state especially in the automobile , machinery and chemical sectors . with over 1,700 members , the german-iranian chamber of commerce and industry in iran is , according to its web site , the fifth largest such german representation in the world .
users logging on to its site now , however , will find it difficult - if not impossible - to see the names of those members . the chamber 's director , michael tockuss , said germany is iran 's number one partner in the construction business . " we have orders worth billions for german companies , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" construction firms like lurgi , krupp-uhde and dsd are working here on huge projects . " tockuss added that daimlerchrysler is set to begin production of its e-class mercedes-benz cars locally and volkswagen is already well established . us disapproves of germa n -ira n ia n busi n ess ties germany 's business concerns in the islamic republic have long been a source of disagreement between berlin and washington .

rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .
while some call for more nuclear energy , others bank on renewable sources . german consumers have been holding their breath when opening their heating bills .
within two years , prices for natural gas alone have risen by 30 percent .
the same is true for heating oil , diesel and gas . electricity prices are also climbing , a fact that has especially hit companies that use up a lot of energy for production .
fuel has become an expensive commodity and the row between ukraine and russia over natural gas has pushed the topic of supply security to the forefront again . german economics minister michael glos , a christian democrat , has been drawing his own conclusions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos is a member of the bavarian christian social union " we need a broad and balanced energy mix of oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear energy and renewable energies , " he said .
" we also need to think about the role of nuclear energy .
thinking should not be prohibited .
but it 's public knowledge that we have n't been able to tackle that problem during coalition talks . " promoti n g n uclear e n ergy glos was referring to the fact that the government 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have been unwilling to revise a previous decision to phase out nuclear energy .
he backs extending the lifetime of existing nuclear energy plants , saying that people should think - without emotion or ideology - about ways to make germany attractive and competitive internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely to get more and more expensive people should also keep in mind that the global energy demand will double by 2030 , according to experts at the international energy agency .
this will lead to a rise in prices . " we must not overlook the fact that fossil fuel prices will not remain at this level , " said energy expert mohsseen massarrat , adding that an advisor to us president george w. bush had recently estimated prices to clime way above $ 100 -lrb- 83 euros -rrb- per barrel . " this can happen relatively quickly , " massarrat said . a look at europea n n eighbors when calling for longer lifetimes for germany 's nuclear energy plants , glos is also looking toward european neighbors .
in france , 78 percent of energy supplies come from nuclear plants .
sweden is no longer pursuing a plan to phase out nuclear energy and is refitting its existing plants .
finland is currently building the world 's most modern nuclear plant - with the help of france and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is largely dependent on nuclear energy currently there are 440 nuclear plants around the globe and 25 are under construction .
germany 's energy suppliers are listening carefully to glos , as klaus rauscher , the ceo of vattenfall europe , is ready to admit . " today we have a law that phases out nuclear energy , that defines remaining energy production levels for each plant and prohibits the construction of new ones , " he said .
" this consensus was a political decision in line with the wishes of a majority of voters .
the matter of the fact is that we , as companies that operate nuclear energy plants , would like to see the remaining lifetime of these plants extended . " social democrats stick to pla n it will remain a wish if social democrats have it their way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel " i 'm certain that the agreement to phase out nuclear energy will remain in place , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel , adding that he is equally certain that conservatives will disagree with the agreement for years to come . " i 'm not ruling out that this viewpoint will change in a few years , " gabriel said . social democrats meanwhile are focusing on the expansion of renewable energy sources .
by 2020 , they are meant to supply 25 percent of germany 's energy needs . glos on the other hand has questioned the feasibility of this ambitious goal .
he also wonders how the remaining 75 percent will be covered . compa n ies wa n t guara n tees it 's an issue that will likely be addressed during an energy summit that has been scheduled for april .
the summit will discuss energy policies for the coming years and look at plans of energy companies . " we 're ready to name concrete investment projects , but we 'll also make clear what kind of conditions will have to be attached to them , " rauscher said .
" if i want to build a new coal energy plant , i have to know about nap 2 - otherwise i can not run the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new energy plants do n't pollute the environment like this one nap is short for national allocation plan , which regulates the emissions trade in line with the kyoto protocol .
every plant that produces co2 is given a reduction goal in the plan .
the first nap will soon expire , with nap 2 replacing it .
but the contents of the latter are n't known yet . modern plants emit 30 percent less co2 on average .
but energy producers are also under pressure because of the price policy .
they 're accused of keeping supplies low in order to secure artificially high prices . while some are calling for more state control , the energy sector is denying any such price fixing schemes . as long as prices for fossil fuel keep rising , however , no one 's likely to see their energy bills drop any time soon . sabine kinkartz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the iran nuclear dispute read dw-world 's dossier on the stand-off between iran and the west over the former 's decision to resume nuclear research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2006 opinion : learning to think outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family with two kids is becoming a rarity in germany once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has been in the eye of a storm ever since her radical proposals for making germany more family-friendly and encouraging women to have babies .
the minister plans to " stay the course " amid the raging storm and she can be relied on to get her way . after all , the emergence of the debate on family-friendliness itself is a victory .
that 's because despite the posturing of the social democrats and the conservative christian social union in the current government coalition , the topic has managed to permanently bag a top spot in the country 's political priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family affairs minister von der leyen has stirred up a storm this positive development naturally is n't just thanks to von der leyen 's tenacity and appetitive for a good fight .
the realization that promoting families is simply a necessity trickled into the awareness of both neo-liberal market-friendly politicians and libertarian proponents of an individualistic social model ever since alarm bells began ringing with regularity over the state of the country 's pension coffers . competitio n for the best ideas the damning pisa study on germany 's education standards also contributed towards strengthening the process .
promoting children also means boosting education .
and it 's common knowledge that a highly industrialized country ca n't afford to ignore its young talent . what has added charm to the ongoing debate is the departure from the traditional family policy reflexes of the two main parties .
now , finally there 's a competition for the best ideas , fueled by the row between the two parties .
the bitter fight over the details of a family-friendly package aimed at boosting the birth rate is proof that there has been a significant shift in thinking that has driven the traditionalists to take up arms . in any case , the ruling coalition decided this week to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market .
measures include tax breaks on child care as well as on new computers , seen as essential for remaining employed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if von der leyen has her way , germany will hopefully see more kids in the future it 's far removed from the traditional family image of both the conservatives as well the classical distribution policies of the social democrats because families with a higher income stand to profit more in terms of absolute figures .
that also applies to child benefits decoupled from income .
in other words , it 's a salary compensation which rises with higher income . thus the family policies of the federal government have for the first time shaken off the social- and symbolic politics attached to it and have emerged on the level of realpolitik , where results , not good intentions , matter . narrow-mi n ded thi n ki n g does n ' t help family affairs minister von der leyen has realistically and pragmatically realized why so many well-educated women have decided not to have children .
it 's not about having 10 or 20 euros more in child benefits for all , but rather about possibilities to reconcile jobs and family without permanently endangering a hard-earned lifestyle . for a successful university graduate , the bleak prospects of a badly-paid part-time job that perhaps allows her to coordinate it with the opening hours of a local kindergarten , is simply discouraging . privately-financed full-day schools at least offer a chance not to miss getting back to work again even if the tax breaks only cushions the costs , and does n't do away with them . the new proposals of the family affairs package are innovative and correct , as is von der leyen 's bold idea to urge local councils to pay their own contribution . did someone say free kindergartens are n't financially viable ?
maybe we need to change our priorities , define things anew .

in that time they have protected 42 successive popes , although more recently the vatican has been guarded by italian security forces and plainclothes police .
but personal safety of the pope is still the guards ' full responsibility .
the guards first arrived in rome on 22 january 1506 .
at that time , helvetian soldiers were employed as mercenaries , renowned for their courage and their loyalty .
there were many famous battles , but their most notable hour came in 1527 , during the sack of rome .
almost the entire guard was massacred by troops of the holy roman emperor charles v on the steps of st peter 's basilica .
of 189 guards on duty only 42 survived , but their bravery ensured that clement vii escaped to safety , down the " passeto " , a secret corridor which still links the vatican to castel sant ' angelo .
swiss elite popular myth says the traditional yellow , blue and red uniforms the guards wear - the colours of the medici - were designed by michelangelo .
but in truth they are only 100 years old and were designed in 1905 by a swiss guard commander .
the weapons they carry were first introduced by the early swiss armies in the 14th century .
it is an axe , known as the halberd , mounted on a long shaft with a spike at the end .
when travelling with the pope , the uniforms and the halberd are left behind .
the halberdiers protect the main entrances to the papal palace and the papal apartments .
during the conclave they were also on guard at the doors of the sistine chapel while benedict xvi was being selected as the new pope .
currently , there are 110 guards and their numbers are limited by law .
the guard says it gets three times as many applicants as there are openings ever year .
applicants must be swiss catholics , have finished basic training in the swiss army and be at least 5ft 8in -lrb- 1.73m -rrb- tall .
minimum enrolment is two years .
murder the guards ' worst moment came in 1998 when the new commander , alois estermann , and his wife were found dead in their apartment .
the swiss guards were at pope john paul ii 's side until the end the man who killed the couple , and later himself , was a disgruntled young corporal annoyed at being overlooked for a medal .
in 1981 , as a young captain , estermann had tried to protect john paul from a turkish would-be assassin .
when the shots rang out he jumped into the pope 's vehicle to shield his body but the pope had already been seriously wounded .
veterans of the guard are taking part in the 500th anniversary celebrations .
official ceremonies began in september with a mass and rally of veterans in lucerne , in central switzerland .
but the main event will be a march to rome , from bellinzona in southern switzerland , by around 80 veterans , to recall the march of the original 200 in 1505 .
then , on 6 may , the anniversary of the sack of rome , the latest round of fresh recruits will be sworn in .

price hikes the explosions occurred on the main branch and a reserve branch of the mozdok-tbilisi pipeline in the russian border region of north ossetia at around 0300 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- .
reports say it could take several days to restore supplies , due to the site 's remoteness and poor weather conditions .
georgia is holding talks aimed at securing supplies from azerbaijan and iran , but this could also take several days , said georgian deputy energy minister aleko khetagurov .
russia also supplies gas through georgia to armenia , which in turn sends some electricity back to georgia .
gas prices to the two countries were doubled in january to $ 110 per 1,000 cubic metres , as part of a series of recent price hikes for former soviet countries .
armenian president robert kocharyan is expected to discuss the gas situation in a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , during a visit to moscow which starts on sunday .
